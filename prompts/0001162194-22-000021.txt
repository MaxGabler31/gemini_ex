Recent Key Developments 
Strategic Investment Transaction 
On January 23, 2022, we entered into (i) a Loan Agreement (the Casdin Loan Agreement) with Casdin Private Growth Equity Fund II, L.P. and Casdin Partners Master Fund, L.P. (collectively, Casdin) and (ii) a Loan Agreement (the Viking Loan Agreement, and together with the Casdin Loan Agreement, the Bridge Loan Agreements) with Viking Global Opportunities Illiquid Investments Sub-Master LP and Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown (Aggregator) LP (collectively, Viking and, together with Casdin, the Purchasers and each, a Purchaser). Each Bridge Loan Agreement provides for a $12.5 million term loan to us (each, a Bridge Loan and collectively, the Bridge Loans). Subject to approval by our stockholders, upon the issuance of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock (as defined below) pursuant to the Purchase Agreements (as defined below), the Bridge Loans will be automatically converted into shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock (as defined below) or Series B-2 Preferred Stock (as defined below), as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Bridge Loan Agreements. The Bridge Loans were fully drawn on January 24, 2022. The proceeds of the Bridge Loans may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Also on January 23, 2022, we entered into separate Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (the Purchase Agreements) with each of the Purchasers pursuant to which, among other things, at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, including the approval of our stockholders, we will issue and sell an aggregate of $225 million of convertible preferred stock, consisting of: (i) 112,500 shares of our Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series B-1 Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share to Casdin, and (ii) 112,500 shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock) at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share to Viking (clauses (i) and (ii), the Preferred Equity Financing, and together with the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the conversion of the Bridge Loans, the Private Placement Issuance). The Series B Preferred Stock to be purchased by Casdin and Viking pursuant to the Purchase Agreements is in addition to any Series B Preferred Stock to be issued upon conversion of outstanding amounts under the Bridge Loan Agreements. The proceeds of the Preferred Equity Transactions will be used by us for expenses related to the Preferred Equity Transactions, as well as working capital, general corporate purposes and merger and acquisition opportunities that we may identify from time to time.
In connection with the Private Placement Issuance, we will change our name to “Standard BioTools Inc.” and Dr. Michael Egholm will be appointed as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors (the Board), each occurring upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreements (Closing). Dr. Egholm will succeed Chris Linthwaite, who will continue as our Chief Executive Officer until the earlier of the Closing or May 15, 2022. 
The Closing is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature, including approval by our stockholders of the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the Private Placement Issuance. Each Private Placement Issuance is also conditioned on the substantially contemporaneous consummation of the other Private Placement Issuance.
Our Board has called a special meeting to be held on March 25, 2022 (the Special Meeting) to ask our stockholders to consider, vote upon and approve (i) a proposal to amend our Eighth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter) to, among other things, increase the number of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, (the Common Stock) that we are authorized to issue from two hundred million (200,000,000) shares to four hundred million (400,000,000) shares and to change our name to Standard BioTools Inc. (together, the Charter Amendment Proposal); and (ii) to approve the issuance of (A) the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, (B) the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Loan Agreements and (C) the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. clauses (A) through (C), the Private Placement Issuance Proposal). The Private Placement Issuance Proposal is conditioned on the approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal. The Charter Amendment Proposal is conditioned on the approval of the Private Placement Issuance Proposal. If both proposals do not receive the requisite vote for approval, neither the Charter Amendment Proposal nor the Private Placement Issuance Proposal will take effect. The parties have agreed that they will not be obligated to close the Preferred Equity Financing if the Charter Amendment Proposal has not been approved at the Special Meeting.
If the Charter Amendment Proposal and the Private Placement Issuance Proposal are not approved by our stockholders at the Special Meeting or the Purchase Agreements are otherwise terminated, then the Bridge Loans will become convertible, at each lender’s option, into Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 352.1126 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 of conversion amount, subject to the cap set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreements. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreements. The Bridge Loans bear interest (i) from and including the effective date of the Bridge Loan Agreements to but excluding March 1, 2022, at 10%, (ii) from and including March 1, 2022 to but excluding June 1, 2022, at 12%, (iii) from and including June 1, 2022 to but excluding September 1, 2022, at 14%, and (iv) from and including September 1, 2022 and thereafter, at 16%. Interest accrues daily and is payable in kind by adding the accrued interest to the outstanding principal amount on the last date of each month. The Bridge Loans mature on the 91st calendar day after the latest maturity date of the loans borrowed under our Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2018, with Silicon Valley Bank, and the principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on the maturity date. 
Market Opportunity
We believe that we have large, multi-billion-dollar market opportunities for our products. We are a leader in the high-growth cytometry market for high parameter applications and high-plex imaging. Through our work with outside consultants and internal market analysis, we believe that the current potential market for mass cytometry high-parameter applications and addressable markets for spatial imaging is just under $1 billion, but expected to be approximately $3 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 27% over the next five years. We believe we will gain greater access to this market as use of our products expands beyond research to translational and clinical use.
For our microfluidics products, our work with outside consultants and market analysis indicate a potential opportunity in the respiratory and COVID-19 molecular diagnostics markets. We believe that our differentiated PCR microfluidics products could be well-suited to serve the needs of the diagnostics market. Our participation in COVID-19 testing provides an entry point if we choose to explore the diagnostics opportunity. The current markets for our products address a broad range of biological analysis approaches, including the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome and microbiome used by academic life science research customers, as well as applied markets customers, including diagnostic and clinical research laboratories, biopharmaceutical companies, biorepositories and agricultural biotechnology entities. Our markets are increasingly looking to study data sets spanning these approaches in a concerted manner to reveal, understand, and address the biological complexities of disease.
In 2020, we were awarded the NIH Contract under the RADx program to support the expansion of our production capacity and throughput capabilities for COVID-19 testing with our microfluidics technology. As of December 31, 2021, we have achieved the required milestones and have received the total NIH Contract value of $34.0 million. Proceeds from the NIH Contract have been primarily used for capital expenditures to expand production capacity and, to a lesser extent, to offset applicable operating costs. With the funding from the NIH Contract, integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) manufacturing capacity increased from 12,000 IFCs per month to 36,000 IFCs per month in our Singapore facility. 
One of the milestones under the NIH Contract was submitting a request with the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay. We were granted an EUA for this assay in February 
2022. This test is authorized for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, mid-turbinate nasal swab, and anterior nasal swab specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider.

Technology
Multi-Layer Soft Lithography
Our IFCs are manufactured using multi-layer soft lithography (MSL) technology to create valves, chambers, channels and other fluidic components on our IFCs that allow nanoliter quantities of fluids to be precisely manipulated within the IFC. We have developed commercial manufacturing processes to fabricate valves, channels, vias, and chambers with dimensions in the ten to 100 micron range, at high density and with high yields.
Integrated Fluidic Circuits
Our IFCs incorporate several different types of technology that together enable us to use MSL technology to rapidly design and deploy new microfluidic applications. The first level of our IFC technology is a library of components that perform basic microfluidic functions, such as pumps, mixers, single-cell capture chambers, separation columns, control logic, and reaction chambers. The second level of our IFC technology comprises the architectures we have designed to exploit our ability to conduct thousands of reactions on a single IFC. The third level of our IFC technology involves the interaction of our IFCs with the actual laboratory environment. Our IFCs are built on specially designed input frames that are compatible with most commonly used laboratory systems.
Instrumentation and Software
Our mass cytometry instrumentation technology includes a custom-designed inductively coupled plasma ion source, ion-optical and vacuum systems, and instrument control electronics. With our CyTOF systems, individual cells are atomized, ionized, and extracted. A time-of-flight mass analyzer separates atomic ions of different mass-to-charge ratios, providing information on temporal distribution of ions. The Hyperion Imaging System combines mass cytometry technology with imaging capability to enable simultaneous interrogation of up to 38 protein markers in the spatial context of the tissue microenvironment. Our systems have the ability to utilize up to 135 channels to detect additional parameters to meet future market needs. Lastly, our Flow Conductor sample preparation system provides sample preparation capabilities for both flow and mass cytometry assays. The Flow Conductor system can process up to 100 antibodies at a time and simultaneously stain and prepare up to 18 specimens. 
Our Biomark HD system includes our custom thermal cycler, the FC1 cycler, and a sophisticated fluorescence imaging system. Our EP1 instrument is a fluorescence reader designed for end-point imaging, suitable for genotyping and digital PCR applications. Our C1 system combines the hardware elements of our IFC controllers and FC1 cycler with sophisticated scripting and protocol control software to enable automation of single-cell capture and preparation for subsequent analysis. Certain capabilities of the C1 system have been used to create our Juno system, which serves as a universal controller and cycler for our Dynamic Array IFCs. Our Polaris system combines the capabilities of all these instruments by incorporating thermal cycling, IFC control, environmental regulation, and imaging.
We have developed instrumentation technology to load samples and reagents onto our IFCs and to control and monitor reactions within our IFCs. Our line of IFC controllers consists of commercial pneumatic components and both custom and commercial electronics. They apply precise control of multiple pressures to move fluid and control valve states in a microfluidic IFC.
We also offer specialized software to manage and analyze the unusually large amounts of data produced by our systems. We offer Fluidigm Cytobank, our cloud-based platform of analytical tools, FCS Express7 Flow, and Maxpar Pathsetter data analysis packages for use with the CyTOF systems. For our Imaging Mass Cytometry platform, Hyperion, we offer various state of the art software packages to enable data analysis from basic to translational research: CyTOF Software 7.0, MCD Viewer, histoCAT, Visiopharm Phenomap and Indica Lab Halo. Our bioinformatic toolset, the Singular software, facilitates the analysis and visualization of single-cell gene expression data. More recently, we extended the scope of the toolset to include DNA analysis tools. We also developed the C1 Script Builder software to enable customers to take full advantage of the flexibility of C1 IFC architecture by allowing them to program their own control scripts for the C1 system.
Assays and Reagents
We manufacture over 800 metal-conjugated antibodies for use with our mass cytometry and Imaging Mass Cytometry instruments to allow detection of up to 48 protein targets simultaneously in a single cell for a total of more than 50 detected cellular parameters. Our metal-conjugated antibodies are manufactured using metal-chelating polymers, which are produced using proprietary polymerization processes and subsequent post-polymerization modifications.
Our Delta Gene and single nucleotide polymorphism type (SNP Type) assay products consist of assay design and custom content delivery systems for gene expression and genotyping, respectively. These offerings provide low-cost alternatives to other available chemistries and allow customers to use IFCs in more flexible ways. PCR assay reagents need to be specific to the gene targets of interest but the process of designing a set of assays may delay the implementation experiments or require the use of expensive pre-designed assays. We have developed a process to provide customers with validated assays for their targets of interest.
Genomics
One primary area of focus within life science research is genetic analysis, the study of genes and their functions. The hereditary material or nucleic acid of an organism is often referred to as its genome, the protein-encoding regions of which are commonly known as genes. Analysis of variations in genomes, genes and gene activity in and between organisms can provide valuable insight into their health and functioning. Single-cell genomics is the study of the sequence and expression of genes and their ultimate functions at the individual cell level.
There are several forms of genetic analysis in use today, including genotyping, gene expression analysis and NGS:
•Genotyping involves the analysis of DNA variations across individual genomes. There are multiple forms of variants, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertion-deletions and copy number variation. A common application of genotyping focuses on analyzing SNPs to determine whether a SNP or group of SNPs are associated with a particular genetic trait, such as propensity for a disease. 
•Gene expression analysis involves measuring the levels of particular ribonucleic acid sequences known as messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which have been transcribed from genes. Determining these levels is important because mRNAs are often translated by the cell into proteins and may affect the activity of the cell or the larger organism.
•NGS is a process by which researchers are able to determine the particular order of nucleotide bases that comprise all or a portion of a particular gene or genome (in the case of DNA sequencing) or gene transcript or sample transcriptome (in the case of RNA sequencing). NGS is routinely used for studies across the research continuum including basic research, biomarker discovery, translational research, and clinical research. 
Gene expression and genotyping are studied through a combination of various technology platforms that characterize gene function and genetic variation. These platforms often rely on PCR amplification to generate exponential copies of a DNA sample to provide sufficient signal to facilitate detection. Real-time quantitative PCR (real-time qPCR) is a more advanced form of PCR that makes it possible to quantify the number of copies of DNA present in a sample.
Proteomics
Another focus within life science research is single cell protein analysis, the study of proteins and their structures and functions. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, signaling response to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another. The proteome varies and is dynamic. Every cell in an individual organism has the same set of genes, but the set of proteins produced in different tissues differ from one another and are dependent on gene expression. Protein analysis is required to profile and understand cellular function as well as the interaction in tissues and other complex microenvironments.
There are several forms of high-throughput protein analysis in use today, including mass spectrometry, traditional flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and both suspension and Imaging Mass Cytometry.
•Mass spectrometry is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio in molecules using external electric and magnetic fields. Mass spectrometry techniques are limited to bulk samples and provide an understanding of global protein dynamics on a tissue or organism level, but do not, by themselves, enable researchers to analyze data at a single cell level.
•Traditional flow cytometry utilizes a suspension of cells in a stream of fluid and passes them through an electronic detection apparatus to allow simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of cells per second. Although traditional flow cytometry technologies are high-throughput with single-cell analysis capabilities, a key limitation is the use of fluorescent dyes to label antibodies for detection. These fluorescent labels have emission spectra that typically overlap, making it challenging to optimize reagents to analyze many protein markers at once. In general, the number of protein targets for conventional flow cytometry is less than about 10 with significant reagent optimization often involved.
•Immunohistochemistry is a method by which cells in a tissue section are stained with antibodies and then imaged with a conventional or fluorescent microscope. Antibodies selected to bind to proteins of interest can be conjugated with either chromogenic or fluorescent labels, allowing cellular proteins to be visualized in spatial context. Immunohistochemistry is used broadly throughout the life sciences industry, and in clinical research to better understand the characteristics and relationship of cancerous versus normal cells in biopsy tissue. In general, the number of simultaneously imageable proteins is less than five, with researchers only able to achieve a higher-parameter resolution using serial sections (several adjacent sections of the same tissue) or other highly laborious, more serial staining methods.
•Suspension mass cytometry is similar to traditional flow cytometry but is based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent labels for detection of proteins, enabling the significant expansion of the number of parameters analyzed per individual cell versus conventional flow cytometry technologies, as well as providing superior data quality. With high-throughput, single-cell analysis capabilities and the ability to analyze more protein markers per individual cell, researchers have more granular information, which allows them to identify and characterize even finer subpopulations of cells.
•Imaging mass cytometry is similar to immunohistochemistry, but is also based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent or chromogenic labels for detection of proteins. This method enables a significant expansion of the number of parameters simultaneously analyzed per tissue section rather than in adjacent sections or via serial staining protocols. 
Customers
With the exception of our Advanta™ Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay (Rx Only), which has been authorized for in vitro diagnostic use by clinical laboratories under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) in the United States and CE-IVD in Europe, and our Advanta™ Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay, which has been authorized for in vitro diagnostic use by clinical laboratories under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) in the United States, being performed on our instruments, we sell our instruments for research use only to leading academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and plant and animal research companies. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Marketing, Sales, Service and Support 
We distribute our systems through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and through distributors or sales agents in several European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific countries. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at laboratory directors and principal investigators at leading academic, translational research, healthcare consortiums, and biopharmaceutical companies who need reliable life science automation solutions to power their disease research with the goal of providing actionable insights. 
Our sales process often involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments on our system and competing systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be 12 months or longer.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Singapore and Canada. Our facility in Singapore manufactures our IFCs and manages production of our microfluidics instruments, which are assembled by our contract manufacturer located within our Singapore facility. All of our IFCs for commercial sale and some IFCs for our research and development purposes are also fabricated at our Singapore facility. Our mass cytometry instruments and reagents for commercial sale, as well as for internal research and development purposes, are manufactured at our facility in Canada. 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in our products. Key components in our products that are supplied by sole or limited source suppliers include a specialized polymer and other specialized materials from which our IFC cores are fabricated, specialized custom camera lenses, fiber light guides, and other components required for the reader of our Biomark system; specialized pneumatic and electronic components for our C1, Juno, Callisto, and Polaris systems; the electron multiplier detector included in, and certain metal isotopes used with, our CyTOF systems; specially developed lasers used in our Hyperion Imaging System; and certain raw materials for our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array Target-Specific primers. The loss of a single or sole source supplier would 
require significant time and effort to locate and qualify an alternative source of supply, if at all, and could adversely impact our business. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development
We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our South San Francisco, California, Markham, Ontario, Canada, and Singapore locations with the scientific, engineering, software, bioinformatic, and process talent that we believe is required to grow our business.
The largest component of our current research and development effort is in the areas of new products, new applications and new content. We launched our Hyperion Imaging System in October 2017. The Hyperion Imaging System provides spatial resolution of protein expression in complex tissue samples at the single-cell level, quantitative measurement using metal isotope tags, and analysis of up to 40 proteins, while having 135 channels available. We also developed metal-labeled antibodies compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples, to be used with the Hyperion Imaging System. 
In 2019, we launched the Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay, a sample-to-answer workflow for comprehensive human immune profiling for use with our CyTOF systems, that puts pre-titrated antibodies in dry format in a single tube, with automated software that provides data analysis in as few as five minutes. This assay is reproducible from site-to-site and lot-to-lot, which is important for translational and pharma/biotech research work. We have collaborated with industry partners to enable workflows and software for the Hyperion and CyTOF systems. Also in 2019, we added seven new metal antibody labels, becoming the first company to enable 50-plex cytometry panels, and launched three Imaging Mass Cytometry panel kits as well as CyTOF Software v7.0, an updated CyTOF software application.
In May 2021, we launched the new, fourth generation cell suspension mass cytometry system, CyTOF XT. It’s main features include automation of sample introduction and acquisition, enabling unattended operation for 23 hours at high stability, lower cost of ownership and enhanced performance in resolution of cell populations. The system enables storage of pelleted samples in the cooled autosampler, automated resuspension of pellets, and addition of beads standards.
We also invest significantly in research and development efforts to expand our microfluidics applications. For example, we continue to develop and commercialize various panel sets for cancer research for use with our systems. In 2017, we successfully launched the Advanta™ Immuno-Oncology Gene Expression Assay, which is a 170-gene expression qPCR assay that enables profiling of tumor immunobiology and new biomarker identification. In 2019, we launched the Advanta™ RNA-Seq NGS Library Prep Kit. Designed to drive significant improvement in the RNA-seq workflow, the Advanta RNA-Seq NGS Library Prep Kit together with the Juno™ system delivers an integrated solution for automated, cost-efficient NGS library prep. In 2020, we expanded our microfluidics franchise to develop products for the COVID-19 testing marketplace. We launched the AdvantaDx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. In addition, we secured significant development partnerships, including for development of OEM systems using our microfluidics technology. 
The second component of our research and development effort is to continuously develop new manufacturing processes and test methods to drive down manufacturing costs, increase manufacturing throughput, widen fabrication process capability, and support new microfluidic devices and designs.
Our research and development expenses were $37.9 million, $36.5 million and $31.6 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. 
Competition
The life science markets are highly competitive and expected to grow more competitive with the increasing knowledge gained from ongoing research and development. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our target markets include competition for human resources; cost of capital equipment and supplies; reputation among customers; innovation in product offerings; flexibility and ease of use; accuracy and reproducibility of results; and compatibility with existing laboratory processes, tools, and methods.
We compete with both established and development stage life science companies that design, manufacture, and market instruments for gene expression analysis, genotyping, other nucleic acid detection, protein expression analysis, imaging, and additional applications. In addition, a number of other companies and academic groups are in the process of developing novel technologies for life science markets. Many of our competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including significantly greater name recognition; greater financial and human resources; broader product lines and product packages; larger sales forces and e-commerce channels; larger and more geographically dispersed customer support organization; substantial intellectual property portfolios; larger and more established customer bases and relationships; greater resources dedicated to marketing efforts; better established and larger scale manufacturing capability; and greater 
resources and longer experience in research and development. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
To successfully compete with existing products and future technologies, we need to demonstrate to potential customers that the performance of our technologies and products, the solutions we provide our customers, as well as our customer support capabilities, are superior to those of our competitors. To differentiate our company from other, larger enterprises, we need to introduce new and innovative offerings regularly and maintain a well-staffed commercial team “in the field” to successfully communicate the advantages of our products and overcome potential obstacles to acceptance of our products. In addition, ongoing collaborations and partnerships with key opinion leaders are desirable to demonstrate both biological innovation and applications that solve customer problems.
Intellectual Property
Patents 
We have developed a portfolio of issued patents and patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies in development. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or licensed more than 410 patents and we had approximately 130 pending patent applications worldwide. Our utility patents have expiration dates ranging up to 2039, and our design patents have expiration dates ranging up to 2044.
License Agreements
We have entered into licenses for technologies from various companies and academic institutions.
Microfluidic Technologies. Our core microfluidics technology originated at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the laboratory of Professor Stephen Quake, who is a co-founder of Fluidigm. We license microfluidics technology from Caltech, Harvard University, and Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. (Caliper), now a PerkinElmer company.
•We exclusively license from Caltech relevant patent filings relating to developed technologies that enable the production of specialized valves and pumps capable of controlling fluid flow at nanoliter volumes. The license agreement will terminate as to each country and licensed product upon expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering licensed products in each country. The U.S. issued patents we have licensed from Caltech expire between now and 2025.
•We have entered into a co-exclusive license agreement with Harvard University for the license of relevant patent filings relating to microfluidic technology. The license agreement will terminate with the last-to-expire of the licensed patents. The U.S. issued patents we have licensed from Harvard University expire between now and 2027. 
Mass Cytometry. Some of the intellectual property rights covering our mass cytometry products were subject to a license agreement (the Original License Agreement) between Fluidigm Canada Inc. (Fluidigm Canada), and PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. (PerkinElmer). Under the Original License Agreement, Fluidigm Canada received an exclusive, royalty bearing, worldwide license to certain patents owned by PerkinElmer in the field of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) -based mass cytometry, including the analysis of elemental tagged materials in connection therewith (the Patents), and a non-exclusive license for reagents outside the field of ICP-based mass cytometry. In November 2015, we entered into a patent purchase agreement with PerkinElmer pursuant to which we purchased the Patents for a purchase price of $6.5 million and a patent assignment agreement pursuant to which PerkinElmer transferred and assigned to us all rights, title, privileges, and interest in and to the Patents and the Original License Agreement. Accordingly, we have no further financial obligations to PerkinElmer under the Original License Agreement. Contemporaneously with the purchase of the Patents, we entered into a license agreement with PerkinElmer pursuant to which we granted PerkinElmer a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up license to the Patents in fields other than (i) ICP-based mass analysis of atomic elements associated with a biological material, including any elements that are unnaturally bound, directly or indirectly, to such biological material (Mass Analysis) and (ii) the development, design, manufacture, and use of equipment or associated reagents for such Mass Analysis.  The license will terminate on the last expiration date of the Patents, currently expected to be in November 2026, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the license agreement.
InstruNor AS. In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of InstruNor AS (InstruNor) for $7.2 million, including $5.2 million in cash and $2.0 million in stock. InstruNor provides automated sample preparation solutions for mass cytometry and flow cytometry instrument markets and is now part of Fluidigm’s mass cytometry business. Included in this acquisition were certain intellectual property portfolio assets comprising patents and/or patent applications directed to 
various aspects of automated cell pretreatment instruments. The expiration dates for the issued patents in this patent portfolio extend to March 2033.
Any loss, termination, or adverse modification of our licensed intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Other 
In addition to pursuing patents and licenses on key technologies, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners, and, when needed, our advisers.
Government Regulation
Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA has authority to allow certain unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used during a public health emergency. In issuing an EUA, the FDA will consider the totality of scientific evidence available to the FDA regarding safety, efficacy and known and potential risks of such products and availability of alternatives to the emergency use products, among others. EUAs issued by the FDA will specify the scope of authorization and conditions of authorization, including limitations on distribution and conditions related to product advertising and promotion. Once granted, an EUA is effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use is terminated under Section 564(b)(2) of the FD&C Act or the EUA is revoked under Section 564(g) of the FD&C Act, after which the product must be cleared or approved by the FDA under a traditional pathway in order to remain on the market or to continue commercialization of the product. 
In August 2020, the FDA granted an EUA for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens collected without preservatives in a sterile container from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare providers. As set forth in the EUA, we are required to comply with the conditions of authorization, including certain requirements pertaining to FDA notification, distribution, printed materials, advertising and promotion. If we, our distributors, or authorized laboratories do not comply with the EUA requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted, and we may be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, penalties, or fines, among other adverse actions. 
If the FDA’s policies and guidance change unexpectedly and/or materially or if we misinterpret them, potential sales of our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay could be adversely impacted. In addition, the FDA will revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying public health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, or if new evidence becomes available that indicates the test does not meet the conditions of authorization or perform as provided in the EUA application. We cannot predict how long this EUA will remain effective. The termination or revocation of the EUA and changing policies and regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and future legislation and regulation in this space, we can provide no assurance with respect to our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
Except for the Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay authorized by the FDA under the EUA granted in February 2022 and the Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay authorized by the FDA under the EUA granted in August 2020, subsequently updated for use with the AZOVA COVID-19 Test Collection Kit, among other updates, all of our other products are currently labeled and sold for research purposes only, and we sell them to academic institutions, life sciences and clinical research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our products are not intended or promoted for use in clinical practice in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, and they are labeled, “For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Accordingly, they are not subject to pre- and post-market controls for medical devices by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that research use only products be labeled, “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures,” or RUO products.
In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance document stating that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities. In the 
future, certain of our products or related applications could become subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA. If we wish to label and market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, thus subjecting them to regulation by the FDA under pre-market and post-market control as medical devices, unless an exemption applies, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior pre-market approval (PMA) from the FDA before commercializing the product. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk to the patient are placed in either class I or II, which, unless an exemption applies, requires the manufacturer to submit a pre-market notification requesting FDA clearance for commercial distribution pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. This process, known as 510(k) clearance, requires that the manufacturer demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a “pre-amendment” class III device for which pre-market approval applications (PMAs) have not been required by the FDA. This FDA review process typically takes from four to twelve months, although it can take longer. Most class I devices are exempted from this 510(k) premarket submission requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or those deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Class III devices typically require PMA approval. To obtain PMA approval, an applicant must demonstrate the reasonable safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on data obtained in clinical studies. PMA reviews generally last between one and two years, although they can take longer. Both the 510(k) and the PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and may not result in clearance or approval. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain pre-market clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
In some cases, our customers may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not enforcing the medical device regulations against LDTs and LDT manufacturers. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA’s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers, but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. More recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomic tests raise significant public health concerns. As laboratories and manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws.
We would become subject to additional FDA requirements if our products are determined to be medical devices or if we elect to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. We would need to continue to invest significant time and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with FDA quality system regulations and other post-market regulatory requirements. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system, standards and regulations in each country may vary substantially which can affect timelines of introduction.
Other U.S. Healthcare Regulatory Requirements
Medical device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to interactions and financial arrangements with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, among others. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of applicable laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Changes in healthcare regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could also impact our business in the future, expose use to increased liabilities, and increase the costs of our operations. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations. To comply with applicable regulations, we have and will continue to incur significant expense and allocate valuable internal resources to manage compliance-related issues. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand or equip our facilities, or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with the regulations. For example, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS), the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), enacted in the European Union, regulate the use of certain hazardous substances, notification of customers of the presence of any substances of very high concern in products, and require the collection, reuse, and recycling of waste from, products we manufacture. Certain of our products sold in these countries are subject to RoHS, REACH and WEEE requirements. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future fines, penalties, and restrictions, such as the suspension of manufacturing of our products or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Additionally, our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives, and biologics. Our research and manufacturing operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. The volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities is small. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations.
Geographic Area Information
During the last three years, a significant portion of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. Total revenue received from customers outside the United States equaled $70.4 million, or 54% of our total revenue, in 2021, compared to $66.2 million, or 48% of our total revenue, in 2020, and $73.9 million, or 63% of our total revenue, in 2019. The majority of our long-lived assets are located within the United States, in Singapore and in Canada. Please see Note 6 and Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding geographic areas. 
Seasonality
Our business is not subject to significant seasonality. However, the timing of customer orders and shipments, customer budget and spending cycles, and new product releases can result in variability in our quarterly revenues. 
Raw Materials
Certain raw materials used in our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array target-specific primers are available from a limited number of sources. Additionally, certain metals used in our Maxpar reagents are available from a sole source. Currently, we do not have supply agreements with these suppliers. While we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.
Backlog
We manufacture products based on forecasts of our customers’ demand and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance. A substantial portion of our products are sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty. Accordingly, backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales.
Human Resource Capital
Our team members share our commitment to improving the human condition and, in turn, Fluidigm strives to create an environment where our people can do their best work. We know that our employees, who supply the ideas, energy, and innovation that powers our business, are Fluidigm’s most valued assets.
We are a values-driven organization. We believe strong shared values are essential for Fluidigm to evolve and grow and to be successful for the long-term. Our values inform our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors and each other. They ensure that we model respect and inclusiveness in our words and actions. Our core values, conceived and developed by our employees, define us when we are at our best and guide us in all that we do. Our core values are to: 
•Create what customers need next
•Drive to make a difference

Employee Safety and COVID-19
Employee safety has always been paramount at Fluidigm, a commitment very much in evidence as we continue to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the outset of the crisis, we tasked a global, interdisciplinary team of leaders in environmental health and safety, human resources, legal, facilities and information technology to develop guidelines and processes for new health and well-being protocols. Also developed were new practices for cross-functional, remote teamwork, operating disciplines and training programs.
To keep our employees safe, we provide to those who can work remotely the tools and resources to do so. Our pivot to remote work has been successful, with employees taking advantage of our technology resources. Essential work continues not only at our facilities and labs, but also every day in home offices, living rooms, kitchens and spare rooms, made possible by our IT systems and the collective commitment of our people. Many of our employees have worked on-site in labs and other facilities throughout the pandemic, and we have adopted a range of protocols and practices to keep them safe.
We have empowered each Fluidigm business location to adopt health and safety recommendations that address local requirements, and we have made site-specific COVID-19 prevention plans readily available for all our employees. In addition, we provide team members practical recommendations based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other regional government entities. We are committed to updating these recommendations and communicating new pertinent information when available. 
One of the key learnings of the extended pandemic is that there are many ways for work to get done. Since the early days of the global health crisis, Fluidigm colleagues around the world have stepped up to make virtual work remarkably successful across a diverse range of teams in every part of the Company. Each Fluidigm site will determine how and when more people return, based on site-specific factors related to health and safety, the needs of the business and each individual’s ability to work remotely versus the necessity to be onsite. We are prepared to be flexible as new information becomes available or as conditions change. As we consider a return to the workplace for more people, safety is our priority. We think 
this is an opportunity to make Fluidigm a place to do your very best work in a way that is safe, flexible, collaborative and right for Fluidigm. 
Compensation and Benefits 
The primary goal of our compensation program is to ensure that we attract, hire, and retain talented and highly skilled team members who are motivated to achieve or exceed our corporate goals. 
We offer competitive total reward packages comprising various elements including market-driven base pay, short- and long-term incentives in the form of performance-based cash and equity, as well as comprehensive health and welfare benefits that include medical, dental, vision, group life, disability, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, as well as our 401(k) or comparable non-U.S. retirement plans, subject to applicable law. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all employees at levels that we believe are comparable to those provided at peer companies. 
Our intention is to align our compensation practices with the changing marketplace, working to exceed our peer competitors. By doing so, we strive to provide incentives to our team members to achieve short- and long-term business goals, ensuring they feel rewarded for their performance and contributions. 
Professional Development
In addition to providing attractive and competitive total rewards packages, Fluidigm believes in fostering individual and organizational effectiveness by offering our team members a variety of professional development programs. These programs are designed to: 
•inform, educate, and inspire our people to reach their professional goals;
•provide professional growth opportunities in different, easily accessible ways to accommodate diverse learning styles, including via classroom/live instructor-led trainings, online/e-learning modules, webinar/virtual trainings, blended learning, and professional coaching; 
•provide individuals and the organization with the knowledge and skills to respond effectively to customer needs as well as current and future business demands; and
•provide ongoing support to the organization’s development efforts.
Our culture is one that actively supports participation in learning activities and the application of new knowledge and skills on the job. As such, we strive to create a work environment that both challenges and supports all our team members to do their best work. 
Diversity and Inclusion
At Fluidigm, our commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity is reflective of our values. We believe that we are strongest when we embrace all forms of diversity, and that it is essential to seek out diverse, innovative ideas and foster an inclusive culture where all colleagues are respected and engaged.
