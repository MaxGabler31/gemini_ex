Item 1. Business.
Overview 
NerdWallet provides trustworthy financial guidance to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).
Our mission is to provide clarity for all of life’s financial decisions.
Our vision is a world where everyone makes financial decisions with confidence.
At NerdWallet, we empower consumers — both individual consumers and SMBs — to make smarter financial decisions with confidence via our digital platform. Technology has changed the way consumers manage their financial lives, making them more comfortable with comparing and shopping for financial products online. This change has accelerated with the dramatic growth in companies offering innovative financial products. At NerdWallet, we are leveraging this transformation to democratize access to trustworthy financial guidance — ultimately helping to improve the financial well-being of consumers and the financial services industry as a whole. As the financial services industry becomes more fragmented and complex, we believe our value proposition as a trusted, independent platform for consumers increases. 
We deliver guidance to consumers through educational content, tools and calculators, product marketplaces and the NerdWallet app. Our platform delivers unique value across many financial products, including credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans, and has grown to include the United Kingdom (UK) and Canadian markets, with plans for further international expansion. Across every touchpoint, the cornerstone of our platform is our consumers’ trust in the independent, objective and relevant guidance we provide, free of charge. 
This trusted guidance has helped us build a large, loyal and well-informed audience of consumers who turn to us as a resource for many of their money questions and to shop for the best financial products for them. We then use machine learning to present personalized options using aggregated and scalable information. As a result, we have become an attractive partner for financial services providers wanting access to high-value consumers — consumers who might not otherwise trust these financial services providers’ recommendations because their guidance is inherently biased toward their own products.
By operating at the intersection of consumers and financial services providers, NerdWallet drives value for both. Through our platform, our financial services partners can reach a substantial audience — we had 19 million Monthly Unique Users (MUUs) per month on average in 2021. After doing research on our platform, these consumers are better informed about the financial decision they’re about to make and often primed and ready to transact. When consumers are more informed about their financial options, they make the appropriate decisions for their needs with confidence, increasing their lifetime value to financial services providers as customers. We have also received feedback from our financial services partners that our users’ approval rates can be significantly higher than those applying through other channels. Plus, as consumers’ smart money moves expand their options, they are eager to explore additional opportunities and products they are now eligible for, driving further demand for NerdWallet’s financial services partners. To meet the standards of more informed consumers, financial services providers in turn must engage in healthy competition for consumer mindshare and develop better financial products, further improving the outcomes for consumers. 
NerdWallet’s ability to serve consumers and financial services providers hinges on our position as an independent, unbiased resource. The core strength of our platform is the trust that we build with consumers and the tailored and personalized recommendations we deliver via our data science models. Our consumer-first values and consumer-centric mission permeate everything we do and have been key to building and maintaining trust — it’s the “consumer, company, team, self” value that guides our decision making and product development. Across the company, Nerds engage every day with our values and mission to democratize trusted, accessible guidance and tools, leveling the playing field for everyone. 
We believe these values will benefit us over the long-term as we build on our leadership as the place consumers turn to first for financial guidance. We have already achieved massive, top-of-funnel reach. By adhering to our consumer-first value, we will not only empower consumers to make better financial decisions, but also help our financial services partners more effectively find new customers well-suited to their products. 
Our revenue was $379.6 million and $245.3 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 55%. We generated a net loss of $42.5 million for 2021, as compared to net income of $5.3 million for 2020. 
Industry Trends in Our Favor
Many trends are transforming the way consumers and SMBs manage their finances and several of these trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating tailwinds in our industry. 
Consumers Manage Their Lives Digitally, and Financial Wellness is at the Forefront of This Change
Increasingly, consumers use a digital-first approach to managing their lives: they manage appointments, book vacations, plan events and shop using apps and this has been especially true in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the past several years, this digital-first approach has also permeated personal finance with consumers expecting to have the ability to manage all aspects of their financial wellness online. To meet this consumer demand, traditional financial services providers have established digital interfaces and are continually adding new functionality. At the same time, successful fintech companies are proliferating and setting new standards for digital experiences. These new players are responding to changing consumer expectations by disrupting nearly every aspect of personal finance and offering a wide range of faster, better and cheaper digital services, continually altering the competitive landscape. By focusing on distinct personal financial products, fintech companies have unbundled personal finance and have provided value that conventional financial services providers cannot, often improving and expanding consumers’ choices and therefore, overall financial wellness. 
Consumers Are Inundated With Choice and Complexity, but Unbiased Financial Guidance is Difficult to Find
While digital access and an increasing number of fintech companies are making it easier to invest, make payments and even take out a loan, the explosion of market participants also makes it increasingly difficult and time consuming for consumers to sift through all of the options to determine which product is best suited to their personal financial needs. 
Financial products and services are complex and consumers are seeking ways to compare and better understand their options. Many consumers do not have a trusted financial advisor to help them navigate this complexity and instead seek advice online. Unfortunately, finding trustworthy financial guidance online can be challenging. Fees are not always transparent, there is not a standard route to achieve financial literacy and creative marketing can leave consumers feeling overwhelmed. 
Consumers Want to Know They’ve Made the Right Choice in Their Financial Lives 
Consumers want to take control of their financial well-being, ensure they’re getting the right deal, understand exactly what they’re signing up for and have confidence in their decisions. This desire to understand and feel well-informed about finances is prevalent across all generations. Even among the newest Gen Z consumers, many of whom may not have much experience with personal finance or even own a credit card, 89% surveyed in a 2021 Tallo study said that it’s a priority for them to learn about personal finance and 75% are interested in taking personal finance classes. 
Our Platform 
We have developed a consumer-first platform that empowers consumers and SMBs to make well-informed financial decisions at the right time and with confidence. The cornerstone of our platform is consumer trust in the independent, objective, and relevant guidance we provide, free of charge. Given it is incredibly difficult for any one person to be deeply knowledgeable across all areas of personal finance, we have a 100+ person editorial team that functions as the “brains” behind our guidance. Our writers and editors, many of whom have joined us from notable publications, cover specific verticals day in and day out, and, as a result, are deeply knowledgeable about the financial areas they cover, producing high-quality and award-winning guidance. The work of our editorial team as a whole is not only a key reason consumers trust our brand and turn to us for many of their financial questions, it is also the foundation of our personalized guidance and our “nudges.” The guidance developed by our editorial team is codified by our product team to create the insights surfaced across our platform. It’s through this unique combination of human-powered guidance and machine learning capabilities, that we can provide consumers with high-quality and personalized insights. 
This trusted guidance has enabled us to build a large, well-informed audience, many of whom are ready to transact. Accordingly, we have become an attractive partner for financial services providers wanting to reach these high value consumers. Today, our platform stretches across many financial products, including credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans.
Our platform aligns the interests of consumers and SMBs seeking financial guidance and products with the financial services providers that offer these products. A successful initial experience often leads to follow-up activity on our platform and we believe it also leads to higher customer lifetime value for the financial services providers. This alignment of interests, enabled by our unbiased and trusted guidance, benefits consumers, the financial services partners and NerdWallet. 
We built NerdWallet with the following key assumptions:
•Everything starts with trust;
•Consumers have an unmet need for unbiased guidance to inform their financial decisions; and
•There is a compelling opportunity to use data to personalize and automate guidance at scale. 
Starting with these assumptions, we offer the following benefits to consumers and to our financial services partners.
Benefits of Our Platform for Consumers and SMBs
Our platform is designed to empower consumers and SMBs to gain clarity about their financial decisions, help them make optimal decisions and instill them with a sense of confidence in their choices. We accomplish this by: 
•Providing Comprehensive Guidance with an Independent, Unbiased Editorial Team. We build trust by offering guidance that is credible, consistent and grounded in our consumer-first values. We establish credibility with financial product reviews and content that cover a myriad of topics, developed by our editorial team which is not influenced by monetization. One of our core values is “consumer, company, team, self.” Consistent with that value, we uphold rigorous editorial standards, and all of our articles, reviews and recommendations are written by our independent editorial team. The value of our brand and long-term relationships with consumers are more important to us than any short-term benefit we may derive from any transaction conducted on our platform. We believe that the result of this approach is the direct, ongoing, trusted relationship we have with our users. 
•Using Simplicity and Transparency to Enable Well-Informed Decisions. We write our articles to appeal to everyone, ranging from the casual reader to someone looking to understand more complex details on a topic. Regardless of the consumer need, we bring a level of clarity to help consumers make sense of even the most complex financial topics. Our content is delivered in a variety of digestible formats, and our comparisons provide transparency on both price and features, given that a particular financial product may appeal to different consumers for different reasons. For example, while some consumers may be looking for the lowest interest rate on a credit card, others may never plan to carry a balance and instead may be looking for the best cash back or rewards offering.
•Acting as a Trusted Guide and Navigator, Providing Personalized Guidance. Democratizing access to financial guidance is only half of our vision; the other half is to make it frictionless for consumers to make financial decisions. We built our platform to appeal to both consumers looking to “do it themselves,” as well as those looking for more support managing their financial well-being. We make it easy for our Registered Users to stay on top of their money by centralizing many of their product decisions in one place. Consumers can get a holistic view of their finances, and hone in on specific details about their spending and saving patterns across accounts. By combining insights from our award-winning editorial team with our machine learning capabilities, we are able to recommend smart money moves via contextual “nudges.” As a result, we have become a one-stop-shop for consumers to track, manage and plan their financial futures. 
•Providing Comprehensive Coverage Across Major Financial Verticals. Today, we have financial services partners in eight financial verticals: credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans. We partner with over 400 organizations, ranging from the largest financial services providers to the most disruptive startups. This comprehensive coverage shows consumers who may be seeking guidance in one area, such as credit cards, the expertise that we provide in other relevant verticals like renters insurance and deposit accounts. Our guidance, however, is not limited to areas with existing partner relationships or those that we monetize. We quickly adapt to the evolving financial interests of consumers and can easily add coverage in new areas. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we added a COVID hub that covered topics such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and their forgiveness, unemployment benefits, coverage of debt relief packages (e.g. student loan forbearance), life insurance and personal loans. Throughout 2021, we augmented our coverage to address the evolving circumstances around student loan forbearance and forgiveness, the re-emergence of travel, and expanding digital investment categories such as non-fungible tokens. 
Benefits of Our Platform for Our Partners
We bring our financial services partners well-matched and well-informed consumers. These consumers also frequently have desirable characteristics — they have higher credit scores and maintain higher levels of investable assets — making them highly attractive for our financial services partners. We have received feedback from financial services partners that our users’ approval rates can be significantly higher than those applying through other channels. Benefits that we provide to our financial services partners include:
•Huge Audience and Reach, with an Average of 19 million Consumers Turning to the Nerds This Year. During 2021, we averaged 19 million MUUs, up 23% from 2020. We also over-index on attracting consumers with high credit scores who are inundated with choices and seek an independent third party to help them find the right product for their distinct needs. These individuals receive many offers for financial products because they are often the most attractive customers for financial services providers as they tend to drive long-term value. We believe we drive strong conversion both on and off our platform. For example, tracking tests with our financial partners in our credit cards vertical have shown that on average, for every transaction that happens through NerdWallet, one or more additional transactions with a user occur with the partner as a result of the user previously engaging with our platform. This encourages our financial services partners to continue promoting their products through NerdWallet, as we are a channel for them to acquire attractive customers.
•Access to Consumers Who Are Ready to Transact. While our expertise and personalized guidance is helpful for consumers at all stages of the financial decision-making process, many of the consumers that use NerdWallet are already poised to make a transaction, using NerdWallet as the final check. For our financial services partners, this leads to more engaged potential customers, who have a better understanding of our partners’ products than the average customer. We believe that these high-quality matches can result in higher customer lifetime values for our partners. In addition to providing our financial services partners with attractive potential customers, we do so just as consumers’ purchase intent is the highest. Because of this, some financial services partners choose to market special or unique offers first or only through NerdWallet. 
•Positive Brand Association. All of our articles, reviews and recommendations are written by our independent editorial team, and because of this, we believe consumers trust our assessment of the financial services and products offered on our platform. As a result, we believe that our financial services partners greatly benefit from placement on our Best-of Awards lists, in our reviews and within other NerdWallet content. In fact, over 60% of the financial services providers who won a 2021 Best-of Award promoted their designation in their own marketing efforts.
•Exposure to Consumers Seeking a Broader Range of Financial Products. Given the breadth of our expertise, consumers are able to use our platform for multiple facets of their financial well-being beyond their initial transactions. Through the wide range of guidance that we offer, consumers are exposed to relevant products outside of the one they are researching at a given time. For example, a consumer researching credit cards may see a relevant article regarding mortgages, then remember that article when they are in the market for a mortgage at a later date. As a result, consumers are exposed to our financial services partners’ products at various points in their financial journey, increasing the value of our platform both to consumers and financial services partners.
Our Strengths
We have five core strengths that provide us with a competitive advantage:
•Trusted Platform for Consumer and SMB Financial Guidance. We believe our strategy of optimizing guidance for the consumer, as opposed to transactions per consumer, will benefit us over the long-term as we build on our leadership as the go-to destination platform for financial guidance. We have maintained an unwavering commitment to providing consumers with free and trusted financial guidance for over a decade, including unbiased recommendations and decision-making tools. Additionally, over 70% of all traffic to NerdWallet in 2021 came from direct or unpaid traffic sources, further demonstrating the value of our brand, organic marketing efforts and strategy.
•Massive Top-of-the-Funnel Reach. The foundation of our platform is a direct, consumer-first approach, combined with deep domain expertise. This drives superior brand awareness and traffic to our platform. During 2021, we hosted an audience comprised of an average of 19 million MUUs, up 23% from 2020. Our platform delivers financial product reviews and decision-making tools across a broad range of topics to consumers, free of charge. This approach powers large-scale traffic acquisition capabilities at the top of the funnel in both unpaid and paid channels.
•Unique Breadth of Financial Offerings Under One Brand. We are a one-stop destination for consumer and SMB financial guidance, covering credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans. This makes it easy for consumers to compare solutions from a wide array of providers across multiple products to meet their diverse needs. As a result, we experience a high level of engagement and repeat activity on our platform. We do not offer our own financial products, but instead surface offers from hundreds of top-quality financial services providers. Therefore, we remain a trusted source of information and insight for consumers and are complementary, not competitive, with our financial services partners.
•Founder-Led Management Team Focused on Continual Innovation. Our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Tim Chen, started NerdWallet in 2009 to bring clarity to all of life’s financial decisions. We grew to approximately $44 million of revenue in 2014 with no outside equity capital. Subsequently, we have increased revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% per year from 2014 to 2021. Today, we continue to maintain a mindset of capital and financial discipline balanced with growth-oriented investing.
•Platform That Drives and Benefits from Strong Network Effects. As more consumers use our platform and engage with our extensive financial guidance and tools, our consumer and transaction database grows and our product recommendations yield higher success rates. This increases user satisfaction, converting more users into Registered Users and improving repeat user rates. As we apply machine learning to match more high-quality consumers with products and services, our platform becomes increasingly valuable to financial services partners, too. This, in turn, attracts new partners and new financial products to the platform. More partners and more products serve to further increase the success rates of consumers using our platform, all of which drives our growth. This creates a unique value proposition for all constituents in our ecosystem, making our platform more valuable.
Our Growth Strategies
We intend to continue investing in and leveraging our key strengths to expand our business:
•Grow Our Traffic and Increase Engagement. We are focused on growing the traffic and engagement on our platform, as well as increasing our number of Registered Users, who have a lifetime revenue value five times greater than our non-registered users and more than twice the transactions and sessions, on average. In 2021, we had an average of 19 million MUUs, an increase of 23% compared to 2020. Since 2016, we have started converting unique users into Registered Users that utilize our consumer decisioning tools and increased machine learning functionality. We had over 5.5 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2019, 8 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2020 and over 10 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to invest in building efficient and scalable technical capabilities to deliver personalized guidance and nudge consumers, at the right time, to take action based on our advice. With better machine learning, we believe our recommendations and contextual nudges will encourage repeat engagement and user registration on our platform.
•Grow Within Existing and New Verticals. Our brand is a natural extension as we land and expand by adding capabilities within our existing verticals and by entering new verticals to provide a broad range of tools for consumers. By improving the quality of our guidance within existing verticals, we believe we can enhance the experience for our users and continue to build recurring revenue streams. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Fundera, which allows us to both improve our offering for SMBs by providing a human touch during one of their biggest financial decisions and build a deeper relationship to anticipate future needs. Upon integration, we combined NerdWallet's top-of-funnel strength to increase organic SMB traffic with Fundera’s monetization strategy, which added a recurring revenue tail. We can apply this playbook to other existing verticals that have relationship-driven or renewal revenue models. Our approach for new vertical expansion is well-defined — provide trusted content and tools to attract organic traffic, then leverage our brand and marketing expertise to accelerate growth. Expansion to new verticals allows us to address more of our consumers’ needs and increases our potential for cross-selling, thereby making existing verticals and marketing channels more efficient.
•Expand Geographically. We believe there is significant potential for us to grow the global reach of our platform. Our success in the United States and our strong brand give us a solid foundation to expand into other geographies. Following our 2020 acquisition of Know Your Money (KYM), an online provider of financial guidance and tools in the UK, KYM was rebranded as NerdWallet UK. By deploying our playbook, organic traffic to the NerdWallet UK site increased from approximately 10,000 monthly sessions pre-acquisition to approximately 130,000 monthly sessions within one year of acquisition. This early proof point has encouraged us to invest in further global expansion, and we expanded organically into Canada during 2021.
•Broaden and Deepen our Partnerships with Financial Services Providers. We partner with banks, insurance agencies, financial advisors, loan brokers and other financial services providers. As we deepen our relationships with our financial services partners, our pricing often increases as they see greater value in being matched with the well-informed consumers who use our platform. We will continue to identify new financial services partners, as well as vertical expansion opportunities with existing financial services partners to optimize our platform for consumers.
Our Market Opportunity 
We have a substantial market opportunity in the growing global market for financial services. Our comprehensive platform serves a broad set of financial verticals, including credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans.
Our current and primary addressable market opportunity is U.S. financial services digital advertising spend, which is expected to be more than $23 billion in 2021 and has been growing at double digit rates annually, according to eMarketer. Additionally, IDC estimates global financial services advertising spend to be approximately $73 billion in 2021, and we believe that we will be able to increasingly address this global spend as we grow internationally. As digital advertising spend continues to increase as a percentage of overall advertising spend, we expect our addressable market opportunity to grow along with it.
We believe the services provided by financial advisors, insurance agencies, loan brokers and others will increasingly transition online in the coming years, which will expand our addressable market. As a result of this offline-to-online shift, offline sales commission dollars will be reallocated to better align with the growth and importance of digital channels. To illustrate the growth potential of our addressable market, for example, the life insurance industry in 2019 spent $9 billion on advertising, of which $2 billion was digital advertising — yet, $13-$15 billion in commissions were still paid to agencies. As financial services providers modernize their approach to sales commissions and related compensation, we expect that our addressable market opportunity will continue to grow.
Our Product Offerings 
The NerdWallet platform is designed to empower consumers at every stage of their financial journey through our personalized offerings. Whether consumers have a specific money question, are shopping for the “best” financial product or want to proactively stay on top of their finances, we provide financial guidance to meet their varied needs. We offer guidance across eight verticals: credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans. 
We believe our unbiased and comprehensive approach to financial guidance and personalized insights provides a competitive advantage for NerdWallet. This advantage will compound as we further expand our product offerings and as we continue to apply the power of machine learning to further refine our personalized insights. To ensure we are able to meet distinct consumer needs and preferences, our financial guidance is delivered in a variety of ways, organized in the following core categories: Learn, Shop and Manage.
Learn
Our mission is to provide clarity for all of life’s financial decisions, and we provide resources that make even the most complicated financial questions and topics simple to understand. The resources consumers can access on our platform include articles, calculators, videos and podcasts. We do this with our award-winning editorial team of Nerds who create and curate NerdWallet’s house views on a wide variety of personal finance topics. Our writers and editors, many of whom have joined us from notable publications, cover specific verticals day in and day out, and, as a result, are deeply knowledgeable about the financial areas they cover, producing high-quality and award-winning guidance. This trusted guidance has enabled us to build a large, well-informed audience, many of whom are ready to transact. Accordingly, we have become an attractive partner for financial services providers wanting to reach these high value consumers. Today, our platform stretches across many verticals, including credit cards, mortgages, insurance, SMB products, personal loans, banking, investing and student loans. These capabilities help consumers make educated decisions about financial products, while allowing us to provide our financial services partners with informed consumers ready to transact.
Shop
NerdWallet’s platform and intuitive user interface help consumers find the products that best match their searches, instilling confidence in their financial decisions. Consumers can easily explore available products, filter results according to their specific needs, sort by NerdWallet rating and narrow down their options with the help of various tools, including side-by-side comparisons, “Best-of” lists and financial product reviews. In our credit card and loans verticals, we also offer the ability to personalize our recommendations by matching consumers to the appropriate lender for their unique needs.
Manage
NerdWallet makes it easy for our Registered Users to stay on top of their money by centralizing many of their financial decisions in one place. Consumers can get a holistic view of their finances, and hone in on specific details about their spending and saving patterns across accounts. By codifying insights from our award-winning editorial team, we are able to recommend smart money moves via contextual “nudges” for example, letting consumers know that the improvement in their credit score means that they could qualify for lower auto insurance rates. As a result, NerdWallet has become a one-stop-shop for consumers to track, manage and plan their financial futures.
Our Technology
We built our scalable technology platform to serve both the growing number of consumers searching for financial products digitally and the increasing number of financial service providers looking to reach consumers with the right characteristics for any given product. Additionally, beyond enabling all elements of our consumer “Learn, Shop, Manage” product experience, our technology is key to keeping our platform secure and compliant. The key capabilities and features of our platform include Content Management, Partner Access, Recommendation Engine and Personal Financial Management.
Content Management
Our content management platform leverages structured data components to showcase our financial guidance to consumers at scale. By codifying our editorial team’s house views, we are able to dynamically recommend relevant content using machine learning for consumers seeking guidance and thus increase product matches. Our personalized article recommendations lead to higher click-through rates, ultimately increasing transactions on our platform.
Partner Access
Our platform manages over 400 financial services partners across eight verticals. We have a team focused on ingesting and aggregating data from our financial services partners across our verticals and financial products to surface and apply product details and attributes for matching with consumers. Our partner data ingestion, quality and compliance processes ensures accuracy and scalability across our platform. We are able to onboard new partners quickly with significantly lower partner marketing compliance risk — for example, inaccurate displays of rewards, fees, or interest rates. Our partner platform also includes the ability to integrate prequalification experiences and targeting engines.
Recommendation Engine
Our proprietary recommendation engine uses machine learning to match consumers to financial products and partners that meet their unique needs. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
•For credit card products, our approval odds model determines a consumer's likelihood of getting approved, which ultimately saves them time, enables users to avoid unnecessary hard credit checks, and drives stronger conversion rates for our financial services partners. 
•For some loans products, we operate a prequalification system that assists consumers through the underwriting process. 
Our technology is flexible enough to engage with financial services partners in ways that align with each industry’s unique requirements and business practices. 
Personal Financial Management
The logged-in experience for Registered Users serves as a one-stop shop for consumers to track, manage and maximize their finances, all in one place. We analyze first-party data, third-party data from financial account aggregators and credit reports to understand our users’ unique financial situations. Our recommendation engine surfaces insights and actions that users can take to make smart money moves, such as improving their credit scores, maximizing their credit card rewards or earning a higher savings interest rate. Additionally, our credit score predictive modeling can estimate the impact of financial decisions on consumers’ credit scores, thus enhancing the insights and recommendations that we can provide to them.
Security and Privacy
As a consumer-first company that is building a trusted brand, we are both committed and mandated to adhere to the strictest privacy standards. We believe our commitment to data protection and privacy, as well as our superior insights and guidance, are the primary reasons why consumers provide us with personal data on our platform. 
We practice a security-first approach to product development, with our security team involved in building our products, features, platforms and infrastructure from the beginning. This approach allows us to build with security as a core requirement rather than treating it as an afterthought. Our security team has a wide range of expertise, from corporate security to network security to application security, giving us the ability to design security into everything that we do, from product development to vendor selection to the tools that we use in our day-to-day work as Nerds.
Marketing
Our marketing function is a critical way we reach and build trust with consumers and is an important growth lever for our business. Our marketing strategy is diversified across brand marketing, organic and performance marketing, customer relationship management and communications. Importantly, these strategies build on and reinforce one another, optimizing for building consumer trust and managing spend efficiently. Brand marketing campaigns, which encourage consumers to turn to NerdWallet with all of their money questions, increase awareness and drive top-of-funnel interest, while amplifying the effectiveness of our organic and performance marketing channels. All of our marketing programs and channels are measured by a data-driven media mix model to determine results and effectively allocate marketing investments to drive maximum business impact.
We have a substantial organic and performance marketing presence that drives high-intent traffic. Our organic marketing program leverages our substantial, proprietary body of trusted guidance coupled with expertise in SEO and public relations, to reinforce NerdWallet as a trusted authority in personal finance. Our performance marketing is also highly optimized for profitable revenue growth.
NerdWallet’s editorial team is made up of writers and editors who are deeply knowledgeable about personal finance. Our editorial team provides well-researched guidance across all areas of personal finance and for various stages of consumers’ financial journeys, from basic information about saving for retirement to timely guidance about applying for unemployment to in-depth product reviews. Our high quality content is distributed by news sites such as The Associated Press, and our writers are frequently featured providing guidance in print, online and broadcast media such as The New York Times and Good Morning America, among others.
Our communications team oversees the execution of consumer, product and corporate communications to both reinforce NerdWallet as a trusted brand and support our organic growth strategies by generating considerable media and syndication coverage, particularly for NerdWallet’s consumer finance spokespeople. 
We believe our marketing strategy will position NerdWallet as the trusted brand of choice in personal finance, improve traffic acquisition at all levels of the funnel, drive engagement with users, and enable us to scale quickly across new consumer finance verticals and geographies. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
Our mission, to provide clarity for all of life’s financial decisions, is rooted in our belief that both individual consumers and SMBs should be empowered to make financial decisions with confidence. As we grow and scale following our entry into the public markets, we are committed to developing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy that reflects our unique position as a trusted brand for personal finance. We look forward to enhancing our disclosures for ESG and engaging with our stakeholders as we continue to make progress on this crucial initiative.
Employees and Human Capital
NerdWallet is defined by its vision, a world where everyone makes financial decisions with confidence. We attract people who are passionate about bringing our mission to life and inspired by the possibility of making real change — to brighten futures, ask hard questions, usher in solutions and provide our consumers with clarity and confidence. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 675 full‑time employees, of which approximately 93% are located throughout the United States and 7% are located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages. 
Our Culture and Engagement 
Our Nerds are the key to our success and the reason we believe we will achieve our mission; they are also one of our most crucial areas of investment. At the core of our Nerdy culture are our values. They’re not just words written on a wall or printed on t-shirts, but lived and breathed every day by every Nerd: (1) Consumer, Company, Team, Self; (2) Relentless Self-Improvement; (3) Ownership; (4) Informed Risk-Taking; and (5) Open, Candid and Constructive. We measure employee performance against these company values and measure employee engagement through surveys, and participation at all-hands and town hall style meetings with leadership. We’re consistently recognized as a Fortune “Best Place to Work” due to our competitive employee benefits, commitment to employee growth and empowerment, and our flexible workplace environment.
Response to COVID-19 and Employee Safety
At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we closed our San Francisco office and transitioned all of our employees to a remote work environment in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and comply with local shelter-in-place policies. Subsequently, in December 2020, we adopted a remote-first policy that allows for almost all roles to be remote on an ongoing basis. Many of our employees transitioned or were hired into permanent remote status and as of December 31, 2021 are not required to report to an office for work.
While we maintain offices in San Francisco, California, Scottsdale, Arizona, New York, New York and Norwich, UK, we continue to monitor COVID-19 pandemic developments and local conditions to adjust our policies accordingly. For example, in response to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases arising from the spread of the omicron variant, we closed our U.S. offices on a temporary basis while leaving our UK office open, but with reduced capacity. 
Understanding that our employees may need additional support during the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced new benefits: access to on-demand mental health support through a third-party service provider and adding mental health days to our company calendar. In addition, we encouraged employees to take advantage of existing flexible time off policies and work with their teams to arrange for a flexible work schedule.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
At NerdWallet, we aspire to provide people with the confidence they need to live their best lives — however they identify. For our consumers, this means building their financial confidence. For our Nerds, this means fostering an inclusive culture that allows all Nerds to be their authentic selves, grow their skills, contribute, and thrive with the confidence of belonging. Our key initiatives include:
•Offering learning sessions and resources for Nerds and managers to help build an inclusive workplace.
•Supporting 5 employee-led employee resource groups, which provide supportive communities for various employee populations and their allies: NerdOut!, NerdParents, NerdWomen, Nerds of Color and NerdWallet Women in Data & Engineering.
•Working to Obtain a Black Equity at Work Certification from Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT). The certification is a three-year process and we have developed a data-driven and comprehensive plan to achieve certification. 
•We use a third-party platform to analyze our employee salaries for gaps based on race or gender twice a year. 
•Offering Learning and Activism Days to inspire and encourage Nerds to grow and give back to their communities. 
Talent Attraction, Recruitment and Retention
Our remote-first culture allows us to reach, attract and retain more diverse talent across all levels of our organization. Attracting and retaining highly skilled, diverse talent is a key component of our burgeoning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and is absolutely critical to our success as a business and to fully realizing NerdWallet’s mission. Once employees are at NerdWallet we invest in their well-being and development offering competitive compensation and benefits and opportunities for career growth. 
•Training, Learning and Development - In line with our Relentless Self-Improvement value, we encourage our employees to seek out professional development opportunities and we provide them with a yearly education stipend. In addition, we provide in-house opportunities for career development, including in-depth training as part of our New Manager Lab.
•Compensation - NerdWallet offers market-competitive compensation to attract employees and a pay-for-performance philosophy to engage and retain our employees. We want our employees to feel invested in the future of NerdWallet by offering all full-time employees equity-based compensation upon hire and through annual performance equity grants.
•Comprehensive Healthcare and Other Benefits - In order to attract, engage and retain our employees, we offer a wide array of benefits to help achieve life balance:

Competition
We have built a scaled and highly differentiated online platform. We face competition from both online and offline financial guidance providers in four primary categories:
•Financial advisors, agents, and brokers who provide guidance and expertise as part of their offerings;
•Traditional media such as the New York Times, U.S. News & World Report and other print and broadcast media;
•Friends and family, as many consumers consult friends and family for financial guidance; and
•Influencers on social media platforms.
In addition, we compete with the following for advertising budgets designated for financial products:
•Financial services providers’ own marketing: Financial services providers connect directly through many different channels, digitally (in-app, email, etc.) and offline channels (direct mail, printed media, etc.);
•Online search engines: Financial services providers spend advertising budgets with online search engines, primarily Google AdWords, as many consumers turn to Google to answer their personal finance questions; and
•Online marketplaces: including Bankrate, Credit Karma, LendingTree and Zillow.
We believe we compete favorably due to the breadth and depth of our financial guidance, the trust we’ve built with our consumers, and our brand, organic traffic, convenience and simplicity.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee and contractor non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as our skills and the ingenuity of our employees, the quality of our guidance to consumers and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have trademark rights in our name, our logo, and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Technology, Security and Intellectual Property — Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
