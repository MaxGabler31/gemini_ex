ITEM 1        BUSINESS
Unless context otherwise indicates, the terms we, us, our, Comstock, or the Company mean Comstock Mining, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
OVERVIEW
Comstock innovates technologies that contribute to global decarbonization and circularity by efficiently converting massive supplies of under-utilized natural resources into renewable fuels and electrification products that contribute to balancing global uses and emissions of carbon. We intend to use our technologies to achieve exponential growth and extraordinary financial, natural and social returns by:

- | building, owning, and operating a fleet of advanced carbon neutral extraction and refining facilities;
- | selling an array of complimentary process solutions and related services, and 
- | licensing selected technologies to qualified strategic partners. 

Our objective is to generate over $16 billion in revenue on an annualized basis by 2030, by responsibly producing and selling renewable energy products that enable us, our clients, and their downstream stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 million metric tons per year. Meeting that objective would offset the equivalent of more than 234 million barrels per year of fossil fuel, or about 6% of the U.S. transportation burn. 
Our technologies unlock vast quantities of historically wasted and unused feedstock supplies with enough short cycle carbon to offset many billions of metric tons of long cycle fossil fuel emissions worldwide. Most of that potential is provided by our Cellulosic Fuels technologies, which efficiently convert wasted, unused, widely-available, and rapidly-replenishable woody biomass into intermediates and precursors for the production of carbon neutral oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, 
marine fuel, and other renewable replacements for long cycle fossil derivatives. Our full portfolio of patented, patent-pending and proprietary technologies includes many additional processes that complement and add to that potential.
We expect to use our technologies to meet our 2030 objectives with less than just 8% of the biomass residues produced annually in the U.S., however, we have structured our business to achieve and enable exponentially greater gains. We believe that the Earth’s natural carbon cycle provides the simplest, fastest, most scalable, and most practical path for enabling systemic decarbonization and achieving a net zero carbon world. Our strategic plan is consequently based on commercializing our technologies and renewable energy products to simultaneously:

- | reduce reliance on long cycle fossil fuels; 
- | shift supply chains that terminate in combustion to short cycle renewable fuels; and 
- | lead and support the adoption and growth of a highly profitable, balanced worldwide short cycle ecosystem, that continuously offsets, recycles, and contributes to neutralizing global carbon emissions by rapidly growing and replenishing vast quantities of feedstock for renewable circular fuels.

In that fashion, we plan to empower our clients, the industries in which they operate, and the populations they serve to Burn Less fossil fuels, to Burn Smarter with renewable fuels, to Burn Cleaner by recycling emissions into additional renewable fuels, and to thereby make disruptive contributions to global decarbonization and helping to achieve a net zero carbon world.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
We group our business activities into two operating segments to manage performance:
Renewable Energy Products Segment
Our renewable energy products segment will own and operate extraction and refining facilities that convert wasted and unused biomass and other natural resources into valuable renewable energy products, including intermediates and precursors for advanced renewable fuels, such as carbon neutral oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel and marine fuel and electrification products. We are currently evaluating several sites for the construction of facilities based on our Cellulosic Fuels technologies, the first of which will be designed to convert at least 330,000 metric tons per year of qualified feedstocks into at least about 33,000,000 gallons of renewable fuels per year and offset more than 330,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. We are also currently equipping an existing production facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial (“TRI”) Center in Storey County, Nevada, with sufficient capacity to extract and refine lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, aluminum and other metals from up to 100,000 tons per year of lithium-ion batteries ("LIB"). Our renewable energy products segment will also license selected technologies to qualified strategic partners, and offer an array of complimentary upstream and downstream design, engineering, fabrication, procurement, and construction solutions based on our experience and core competencies in technology development, process engineering, and project deployment, with a focus on processes that support long-term feedstock and offtake clients.
Strategic and Other Investments Segment
We own and manage a number of investments and projects that are strategic to our plans and ability to produce and maximize revenue and throughput in our renewable energy products segments, but that are not a component of that segment or otherwise have distinct operating activities for management purposes. Our strategic and other investments and projects include our recent investments in quantum computing and carbon dioxide utilization technologies as well as our mining, mercury remediation and related investments and our property development assets and related investments. 
Summary Segment Results
We earned $228,123 and $201,700 in revenue in our strategic and other investments segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We earned $634,042 and $0 in revenue in our renewable energy products segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
We had loss from operations of $4,604,326 and $5,474,261 per year for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in our strategic and other investments segment. We had loss from operations of $1,801,595 and $0 per year for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 in our renewable energy products segment.
We had total assets of $83,952,795 and $43,123,562 in our strategic and other investments segment at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We had total assets of $43,001,837 and no assets in our renewable energy products at December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 20, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Comstock historically focused on natural resource exploration, development, and production, with an emphasis on mining gold and silver resources from its extensive contiguous property holdings in the historic Comstock Lode and Silver City mining districts in Nevada (collectively, our “Comstock Mineral Estate”). Between 2012 and 2016, we mined and processed about 2.6 million tons of mineralized material from the Comstock Mineral Estate, producing 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver. We subsequently focused on exploration and development activities in anticipation of continued production, while evaluating and exploiting opportunities for the monetization of selected assets, debt elimination, new investments, and diversification. During 2020 and 2021, we completed a series of transactions that were designed to build on our competencies and position us to address and capitalize on the global transition to clean energy. Those transactions primarily included (i) our sale of Comstock Mining, LLC, the owner of our Lucerne resource area in Storey County, Nevada, and related permits, (ii) our acquisitions of 100% of Comstock Innovations Corporation (F/K/A Plain Sight Innovations Corporation), 100% of Comstock Engineering Corporation (F/K/A Renewable Process Solutions, Inc.), 100% of MANA Corporation and 90% of LINICO Corporation, (iii) our acquisition of intellectual property assets from FLUX Photon Corporation, and (iv) our purchase of 48.19% of Quantum Generative Materials LLC and 25% of Mercury Clean Up LLC. Collectively, these transactions added the management, employees, facilities, intellectual properties, and other assets we needed to restructure and transform our company and business into an emerging leader in the innovation and sustainable production of renewable energy products, including cellulosic fuels and electrification metals. Additional information on these transactions is provided in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Our management team has deep experience in a diverse array of industries, including renewable fuels, hazardous waste, graphite, mining, metal manufacturing, agriproducts, and intellectual property research, development, and commercialization. We have core competencies in systemic management and innovating and scaling new technologies to commercial maturity, with significant expertise and know-how in the design, engineering, construction, integration, operation, and scaling of facilities based on our patented, patent-pending, and proprietary processes and other technologies. Our expertise, know-how, technologies, and patent position collectively comprise our primary competitive strengths, and form the basis for our growth plans and the value-added renewable energy products, process solutions, related services, and client licensing options.
Our team has designed, engineered, built, commissioned, and operated many industrial processing facilities in multiple industries, including 26 advanced renewable fuel production facilities for third-party clients. Most notably, our team invented and commercialized technologies that integrate into the backend of corn ethanol plants to extract and recover what was an historically-overlooked natural resource – inedible crude corn oil, for use in the production of advanced carbon-neutral liquid fuels and other biomass-derived alternatives to fossil fuel products. Upwards of 95% of the U.S. corn ethanol industry uses that technology today to offset more than 20 million barrels of fossil fuels per year, with an estimated total lifetime contribution in excess of 250 million barrels of avoided fossil fuel. Those results are validating proof of a repeatable and scalable concept that we plan on capitalizing on with our patented, patent-pending and proprietary technologies. Our strategic and tactical plans rely on the commercialization of technologies for renewable energy products that shift and leverage the consumption patterns of industries and populations to enable systemic decarbonization and contribute to a net zero carbon world.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Electrification and continued advancements in energy storage are vitally necessary to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, more than 70% of the electricity needed to power that infrastructure is currently generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, notwithstanding the impact of increased global urgency, continued innovation, and the accelerating growth of renewable energy. 
Simultaneously, about 9% of the estimated 70 million new vehicles sold worldwide in 2021 were electric. While electric vehicle (“EV”) sales are anticipated to account for between 30% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030, there will only be about 145 million EVs on the road in 2030 under those aggressive growth scenarios. In contrast, there were more than 1.45 billion passenger cars and commercial vehicles in use worldwide at the end of 2020, and more than 98% of them were powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. Those vehicles accounted for 63% of the 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted by the transportation sector in 2020, and that amount is expected to increase by more than 50% as the combustion fleet 
continues to grow beyond 2030. The growth and turnover of that fleet will continue to have a significant impact on the world’s harmful carbon emissions. 
Accordingly, we believe that combustion will continue to be the dominant source of power for transportation and energy for decades to come, if for no other reason than the fact that the associated infrastructure is already deployed on a planetary scale. We also believe that the world’s entrenched combustion apparatus can play an extremely important role in enabling systemic decarbonization and achieving global net zero. Using it will require focus to shift to burning in balance – to sustainably cycling carbon by burning less fossil fuel, by burning more renewable fuel, and by growing and monetizing more biomass to recycle emissions and maximize the production of renewable fuels. 
The Earth’s natural carbon cycle provides a highly-scalable pathway for global decarbonization. The key to using it is to strike and sustain a profitable new balance between its living systems and humanity’s global uses, wastes, and emissions of carbon. We plan on doing so by focusing on and working exclusively with the abundance of short cycle carbon that’s already on and above the surface of the Earth, and by leaving as much long cycle fossil carbon as possible in subsurface reserves. Humanity’s combustion practices can become a part of the natural carbon cycle by providing sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide to grow more terrestrial biomass, which would increase and ultimately iterate to a healthy balance with the available emissions.
In a simple example of the associated impact, sustainably harvesting 3.4 billion metric tons per year of biomass would be enough to absorb 4.0 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year and produce 1.5 billion metric tons per year of renewable fuels with our Cellulosic Fuels technologies. That fuel would shift 10% of the global burn to short cycle carbon, thereby reducing the net addition of previously sequestered long cycle carbon into the atmosphere and oceans by 4.0 billion metric tons to 36 billion metric tons per year. Total fuel consumption worldwide would remain at 15 billion metric tons per year, and total emissions would remain at 40 billion metric tons per year, but 10% of the global burn would then be circular. 
The World Resources Institute (“WRI”) estimates that the world’s forests absorb about 16 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, or about 8 billion net of emissions due to deforestation and other disturbances. Reducing and replacing half of those losses would offset 10% of humanity’s annual emissions, however, prior methods for effecting such solutions had limited economic value. Our Cellulosic Fuels solutions dramatically alter that dynamic by unlocking and efficiently converting wasted, unused, and rapidly-replenishable woody biomass and other short cycle renewable resources into intermediates and precursors for the production of carbon neutral crude oil, ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, marine fuel, and other renewable replacements for long cycle fossil derivatives. 
Our strategic plan is based on innovating and using our technologies and the renewable energy products that they enable to reduce reliance on long cycle fossil fuels, to shift to and maximize throughput of short cycle fuels, and to lead and support the adoption and growth of a balanced global short cycle carbon ecosystem, with embedded economic incentives to offset, recycle, and contribute to neutralizing emissions by growing and selling more feedstock and fuel. Our objective is to generate over $16 billion in revenue on an annualized basis by 2030, by responsibly producing and selling renewable energy products that enable us, our clients, and their stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 million metric tons per year. Meeting that objective would offset the equivalent of 234 million barrels per year of fossil fuel, or about 6% of the U.S. transportation burn.
We also make strategic and other investments that contribute to our mission of enabling systemic decarbonization and help to realize our vision of a net zero carbon world. Our current investments include advanced new technologies involving atmospheric water harvesting, carbon capture and utilization, and quantum computing to harness quantum-enabled generative adversarial neural networks to develop breakthrough new materials for energy storage, electronics, carbon capture and utilization, and mining.
COMPETITION
We compete with other renewable fuels, electrification metals, clean technology engineering, licensing, and mineral exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of properties and other assets, feedstock and offtake agreements, and clients, and the attraction and retention of human capital. Those competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
While we plan to produce and sell renewable alternatives to fossil crude to fuel producers, we also have the capability of directly refining those alternates into renewable fuels, We accordingly face competition from producers and suppliers of fossil fuels, and producers, marketers, traders, and distributors of renewable fuels. 
Our cellulosic ethanol products will compete with ethanol produced by the highly fragmented U.S. corn ethanol industry, including from plants owned by farmers, cooperatives, oil refiners and retail fuel operators that may continue to operate even 
when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations. As of December 31, 2020, the top five corn ethanol producers operated 69 plants and accounted for approximately 40% of the domestic production capacity with capacities ranging from 800 million gallons per year to 1.8 billion gallons per year. About half of the corn ethanol plants in the U.S. are standalone facilities that accounted for approximately 38% of domestic production capacity. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we will compete with independent biomass-based diesel producers, as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. 
Ag Processing Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial, feedstock sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make renewable fuel as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We will also compete with several large and well capitalized producers of renewable diesel. Neste Corporation has about 900 million gallons of renewable diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe, a significant portion of which is imported into the U.S. Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, a joint venture between Valero Energy Corporation and Darling Ingredients Inc., produces about 275 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and it is in the process of expanding capacity to 675 million gallons per year by 2022. In January 2021, Valero announced that it will build a 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant in Texas with Darling. We expect significant renewable diesel capacity to initiate new production by 2030. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration data, renewable diesel imports from Singapore to the U.S. totaled 173 million gallons in 2018, 252 million gallons in 2019, and 280 million gallons in in 2020. Significant additional import activity from other countries is likely to occur. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with us, either by converting oil refineries to produce renewable diesel or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Several petroleum refiners in the U.S. have affected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables in the past year including but not limited to Sinclair, Phillips 66, Holly Frontier, Marathon, and Exxon. Some of the largest refiners have started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation.
We also operate in the lithium-ion battery (“LIB”) recycling industry, where we face competition primarily from companies that focus on one type of recycling, some of which have more expertise in the recycling of that material than we do. We also compete against companies that have a substantial competitive advantage because of longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources. National or global competitors could enter the market with more substantial financial and workforce resources, stronger existing customer relationships, and greater name recognition, or could choose to target medium to small companies in our markets. Competitors could also focus their substantial resources on developing more efficient recovery solutions than our highly efficient processes planned for lithium, graphite and other material extraction. Competition also places downward pressure on contract prices and profit margins, which presents significant challenges to maintaining growth rates and acceptable margins. 
CUSTOMERS
The Company is not dependent on a limited number of customers for its sales.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE
We are an emerging leader in the global shift to a circular economy. Our systemic management methodology, corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) policies and framework defines, seeks, and accounts for benefits in ways that align all of our stakeholder interests with sustainability objectives that are designed to rise to the realities of our time; where benefits are defined in terms of three different interdependent forms of capital – financial, natural, and social, that we generate while making a positive impact on the economy, the environment, and our local and global communities. 
Our objective is to generate over $16 billion in revenue on an annualized basis by 2030, by responsibly producing and selling renewable energy products that enable us, our clients, and their downstream stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by at least 100 million metric tons per year. Meeting that objective would offset the equivalent of more than 234 million barrels per year of fossil fuel, or about 6% of the U.S. transportation burn. 
REGULATORY MATTERS
Once operational, our renewable energy products segment will be sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, jet fuel, marine fuel, other renewable fuels, and their intermediates, precursors, and derivatives, which in turn may impact our throughput. 
The demand for cellulosic and carbon neutral fuels is rapidly increasing, and supply is virtually non-existent for the want of recently developed process technologies. Global demand is approaching 10% of the total fuel supply, with stable market prices linked to carbon reduction standards. America’s renewable fuels standard (“RFS II”) is driving innovation by both requiring and incentivizing use of advanced cellulosic fuels, including for upwards of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol annually by 2022. 
Under the RFS II, renewable fuel producers are essentially guaranteed market access inasmuch as fossil fuel producers are required to purchase renewable fuels to meet RFS II quotas. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to blend into the fuel supply each year based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, if the requirement severely harms the environment, or harms the economy of the nation or a state. The RFS II volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as obligated parties in the RFS II regulations. Obligated parties are required to incorporate a certain percentage of renewable fuel into their petroleum-based fuel or purchase credits in the form of renewable identification numbers from those who do. An obligated party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest U.S. petroleum refining companies, such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Marathon, PBE, Phillips 66, and Valero, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
The RFS II requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories: cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel, which can be satisfied with ethanol made from woody biomass and renewable diesel, respectively. The total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel requirement, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels. The RFS II requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including fuels produced with our Cellulosic Fuels technologies, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement which our solutions meet. 
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Renewable diesel typically has an EEV of 1.7, compared to 1.0 for ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
Advanced cellulosic and other fuels are able to be sold at higher prices than traditional corn ethanol due to their increased GHG reductions. The EPA ensures compliance with the RFS II by assigning a Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) to each gallon of renewable fuel produced or imported into the U.S. RINs are generated by renewable fuel producers, passed onto fossil fuel producers that purchase renewable fuels, and then submitted to the EPA. Producers assign RINs to their renewable fuels and the RINs are detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel domestically. Market participants can trade the detached RINs in the open market. Fossil fuel producers that do not want to buy and distribute renewable fuel can buy RINs and submit them to the EPA to show compliance with RFS II. Obligated parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An obligated party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS II must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS II requirements. 
The market price of detached RINs affects the price of renewable fuels in certain markets and can influence purchasing decisions by obligated parties. The value of RINs can significantly impact to the price of renewable fuel. In 2020, RIN prices reported by the Oil Pricing Information System, or OPIS, fluctuated significantly throughout the year and ranged from a low of $0.37 per gallon to a high of $1.03 per gallon, or 45% of the average spot price, in December 2020.
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit (“BTC”), provides an additional $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against federal excise tax liabilities or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the U.S. Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005 and has been allowed to lapse multiple times before being retroactively reinstated. The BTC is an incentive shared across the advanced biofuel production and distribution chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In December 2019, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019, and made effective from January 2020 through December 2022.
Individual state and other governments are also pushing the demand beyond the federal requirements. California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia all have Low Carbon Fuel Standards (“LCFS”) that encourage consumption of advanced biofuels by setting annual carbon intensity (“CI”) emission standards which reduce over time. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives.
The goal of California’s LCFS, for example, is to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector by 20% by 2032. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a CI score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual CI target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. Any alternative fuel is characterized by its CI, generating credits based on its carbon emissions (or lack thereof). Fuels with the lowest CI score, generate the most credits, and reap the highest market price. Although any fuel can generate credits, California also has an E10 mandate which requires all gasoline be mixed with 10% ethanol, this has led to a consistent demand for over 1 billion gallons of ethanol per year. As the LCFS and CI requirements get increasingly stringent, fuel providers will be unable to meet their required CI reductions with corn ethanol alone. Comstock’s advanced cellulosic ethanol is less carbon intensive than conventional corn ethanol, thereby providing opportunities for increased sales. For comparison, the market value of cellulosic ethanol in the California market is equal to the price for conventional ethanol, plus the RIN value, plus the LCFS value based on the CI score. Under current market conditions, our cellulosic ethanol would have a market value in California ranging from $4.97 per gallon with the lower limit CI scoring, to $4.43 per gallon using the upper limit for CI scoring, as compared to $2.16 per gallon for corn ethanol. We will obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified fuels into California. During 2020, California LCFS carbon credits ranged from $167.50 per metric ton to $218.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS. 
Likewise, the Oregon Clean Fuel Program requires a 10% reduction of the average carbon intensity of Oregon’s transportation fuels from 2020 levels by 2025. The baseline year for the program is 2020 and represents 10% ethanol blended with gasoline and 5% biodiesel blended with diesel. The Oregon Renewable Fuels Standard requires all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10% ethanol (“E10”). In addition, all diesel fuel sold in the state must be blended with at least 5% bio-based diesel. In March of 2020, the Oregon Governor issued an executive order to expand the Clean Fuel Program to achieve at least a 20% reduction from 2020 levels by 2030 and a 25% reduction by 2035. The executive order is currently in a rule making process, with a targeted effective date of January 1, 2023. We will obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified fuels in Oregon. During 2020, Oregon OCF carbon credits ranged from $105.00 per metric ton to $155.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS.
In the European Union, or EU, the Renewable Energy Directive established a 10% target by 2020 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in EU member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target has been realized through biofuels. In 2018, a revised Renewable Energy Directive, RED II, was established. RED II set a target of 14% renewables in transport and a 32% reduction of greenhouse gases, to be progressively achieved from 2021 until 2030. Biofuels produced from certain types of waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from extra incentives and so-called advanced feedstocks even get a specific sub-mandate. Additionally, RED II opens up new outlets such as marine fuels or renewable aviation fuels. In 2021, each of the EU Member States is in the process of ratifying RED II into national legislation. Since the adoption of RED II, the EU has introduced the European Green Deal, a package of new measures that are intended to align the EU's environmental goals with the Paris Accord objectives and, according, the European Commission is exploring whether to update RED II.
A small refinery is defined as one that processes fewer than 75,000 barrels of petroleum per day. Small refineries can petition the EPA for a SRE which, if approved, waives their portion of the annual RVO requirements. The EPA, through consultation with the DOE and the USDA can grant a full or partial waiver, or deny it outright within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for the 2017, 2018 and 2021 reporting years than they had in prior years. This totaled 790 mmg of waived requirements for the 2021 compliance year, 1.82 billion gallons for 2017 and 1.43 billion gallons for 2018. In 
doing so, the EPA effectively reduced the RFS II mandated volumes for those compliance years, and as a result, RIN values declined significantly.
Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the 2019 RVO rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rule making. This was the first RFS II rule making since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light; however, the EPA had declined to cap the number of waivers it grants, and until late 2019, had declined to alter how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its annual volume calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. We believe the EPA’s recent approach accomplished the opposite in that even if all the obligated parties complied with their respective percentage obligations for 2019, the nation’s overall supply of renewable fuel would not meet the total volume requirements set by the EPA. This undermines Congressional intent to increase the consumption of renewable fuels in the domestic transportation fuel supply. Biofuels groups have argued the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future. Our design, engineering, licensing, installation, commissioning and maintenance services are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which require a standard of care to control potential pollution and limit actual or potential impacts to the environment and personnel involved. While our engineering and installation work regularly exceeds health, safety and environment requirements, a violation of these laws and regulations, or of permit conditions, can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. Operating expenses to meet regulatory requirements, including all environmental permits, will be an integral part of service costs. Costs for compliance with environmental laws include safety and health protection measures, controls limiting air emissions and effluent discharges, emergency response capabilities, storm water management, recordkeeping and training. We often assist our customers in environment, health and safety compliance issues, including new requirements concerning greenhouse gas emissions. It may not be possible to completely segregate our environmental, health and safety responsibilities from those of our customers. In 2019, in a supplemental rule-making to the 2020 RVO rule, the EPA changed their approach, and for the first time accounted for the gallons that they anticipate will be waived from the blending requirements due to small refinery exemptions. To accomplish this, they added in the trailing three year average of gallons the DOE recommended be waived, in effect raising the blending volumes across the board in anticipation of waiving the obligations in whole or in part for certain refineries that qualify for the exemptions. Though the EPA has often disregarded the recommendations of the DOE in years past, they stated in the rule their intent to adhere to these recommendations going forward, including granting partial waivers. 
In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled on RFA et. al. vs. EPA in favor of biofuels interests, overturning EPA’s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separate grounds. The Court agreed that, under the Clean Air Act, refineries are eligible for SREs for a given RVO year only if such exemptions are extensions of exemptions granted in previous RVO years. In this case, the three refineries at issue did not qualify for SREs in the year prior to the year that EPA granted them. They were thus ineligible for additional SRE relief because there were no immediately prior SREs to extend. In addition, the Court agreed that the disproportionate economic hardship prong of SRE eligibility should be determined solely by reference to whether compliance with the RFS II creates such hardship, not whether compliance plus other issues create disproportionate economic hardship. The Court thus vacated EPA's grant of SREs for certain years and remanded the grants back to EPA. The refiners appealed for a rehearing which was denied. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and in January 2021, the Supreme Court announced they would hear the case. If the decision against the EPA is upheld by the Supreme Court, it is uncertain how the EPA will propose to remedy the situation. In light of the 10th Circuit ruling, a number of refineries have applied for “gap year” SREs in an effort to establish a continuous string of relief and to ensure they are able to qualify for SREs going forward. A total of 64 gap year requests were filed with the EPA and reviewed by the DOE. In September 2020 the EPA announced that they were denying 54 of the gap year requests that had been scored and returned by DOE, regardless of how they had been scored. Without a string of continuous SRE approvals, almost no small refinery would be eligible to apply for hardship relief in this manner, unless the Supreme Court overturns the 10th Circuit ruling, which we believe is unlikely.
Our renewable energy products segment activities are subject to various and extensive environmental and other regulations. We will be required to obtain and maintain various environmental permits to operate our plants and other facilities. Renewable fuel production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 
There has been an increase in battery regulation globally in recent years. For example, California is evaluating a policy to drive Recycling Efficiency Rates as close to 100% as possible, potentially beginning as early as 2022. In Canada, Ontario is requiring Recycling Efficiency Rates for lithium ion batteries (“LIBs”) of over 70% by 2023. China has required functional material recovery rates greater than 80% since 2018, with specific targets by key materials (nickel, cobalt, and lithium). The European Union proposes to update its EU Battery Directive during 2021 to implement more aggressive recycling targets, including minimum material recovery rates of 90% for both cobalt and nickel by 2025, a minimum recovery rate of 35% for lithium by 2025, and a Recycling Efficiency Rate of least 65% by 2025. Our renewable energy products segment holds all licenses currently required in connection with its technologies and operations. We have engaged a third-party consultant to work across all projects, supporting us with permitting and regulatory compliance, and keeping us apprised of all relevant regulations and related changes. 
Our design, engineering, licensing, installation, commissioning and maintenance services are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which require a standard of care to control potential pollution and limit actual or potential impacts to the environment and personnel involved. A violation of these laws and regulations, or of permit conditions, can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. Operating expenses to meet regulatory requirements, including all environmental permits, will be an integral part of service costs. Costs for compliance with environmental laws include safety and health protection measures, controls limiting air emissions and effluent discharges, emergency response capabilities, storm water management, recordkeeping and training. We often assist our customers in environment, health and safety compliance issues, including new requirements concerning greenhouse gas emissions. It may not be possible to completely segregate our environment, health and safety responsibilities from those of our customers.
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained substantially all licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and some of our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. 
We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. The Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (“NAC”) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (“BMRR”) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that, after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (“Lexon”), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $7,251,950, including $6,751,950 for BMRR and $500,000 of additional reclamation surety bonding directly, with Storey County. As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% annual bonding fee and signed a corporate guarantee. The bonded amount is $7,251,950, and the collateral held on deposit at December 31, 2021 is $2,695,944.
CONTINGENCIES
Under Comstock’s insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposures, as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The deductible per occurrence for environmental impairments is $500,000. Environmental liability insurance is carried with policy limits of $10,000,000 per occurrence with a $5,000,000 umbrella. We also carry professional liability, pollution, auto and worker’s compensation insurances.
From time to time, we are involved in claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We protect our intellectual properties through a combination of patents, patent applications, license agreements, common law copyrights, and trade secrets. Comstock IP Holdings holds our portfolio of patented, patent-pending, and proprietary technologies, including our Cellulosic Fuels and Electrification Metals technologies, as well as an array of additional processes, including atmospheric water harvesting and carbon capture and utilization. The earliest of our patents are scheduled to expire is in 2033, however, we have additional issued and pending patents that are expected to expire at later dates. We have also developed and use trade secrets to protect our know-how in the systemic extraction, valorization, and processing of wasted or used resources. 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

The attraction, retention and development of employees is critical to our success. We accomplish this, in part, by our systemic management practices, competitive compensation practices, training initiatives, and growth opportunities within the company. Comstock currently has 32 full-time employees. We also employ sales, engineering, research, geological, regulatory, environmental, operating, financial, and administrative personnel. There is no union representation for any of our employees.

- | We have a limited operating history. 
- | We may never earn significant revenues from our operations. 
- | We may be unable to manage our future growth. 
- | We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all. 
- | We are exposed to global health, economic, supply chain, and market risks that are beyond our control, which have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our financial results and capital requirements. 
- | The Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal law requiring the consumption of qualifying renewable fuels, could be repealed, curtailed or otherwise changed, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating margins and financial condition. 
- | Loss of or reductions in federal and state government tax incentives for renewable fuel production or consumption may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins. 
- | We intend to derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our renewable fuel in states with Low Carbon Fuel Standards, however, adverse changes in the associated laws or reductions in the value of the applicable credits would harm our revenues and profits.
- | A decline in the adoption rate of renewable energy or electrification, or a decline in the support by governments for renewable energy and electrification technologies, could materially harm our financial results and ability to grow our business. 


- | Our success will depend on acquiring, maintaining, and increasing feedstock supply commitments, as well as securing new customers and offtake agreements. 
- | Our margins are dependent on the spread between the market prices for our renewable energy products and the costs for our feedstocks, which may be volatile and can cause our results of operations to fluctuate substantially. 
- | Our operations depend on the availability of sufficient water supplies. 
- | Owning property and water rights and options on property and water rights carries inherent risks. 
- | We do not have proven or probable reserves, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals and metals we produce will be sufficient to recover our investment and operating costs. 
- | The cost of our exploration, development and acquisition activities is substantial, and there is no assurance that the quantities of minerals and metals we discover, acquire or recover will justify commercial operations or replace future reserves. 
- | Resource and other material statements are estimates subject to uncertainty due to factors including market prices, and the inherent variability and recoverability of targeted natural resources in extraction and beneficiation processes. 
- | Risk management transactions could significantly increase our operating costs and may not be effective. 
- | In addition to changes in prevailing commodity prices, our results of operations could be significantly affected by the volume, mix, and composition of the various wasted and unused natural resource feedstocks that we are targeting, all of which are subject to variance. 
- | If one or more of our facilities become inoperative, capacity constrained, or if operations are disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

- | Increases in transportation costs or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
- | We operate in highly competitive industries and expect that competition will increase. 
- | Our activities are inherently hazardous and any exposure may exceed our insurance limits or not be insurable. 
- | Our operations are subject to strict environmental laws and regulations, including regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change, which could result in added costs of operations and operational delays, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
- | Failure to comply with governmental regulations, including EPA requirements relating to RFS II or new laws designed to deal with climate change, could result in the imposition of higher costs, penalties, fines, or restrictions on our operations and remedial liabilities. 
- | Our ability to execute our strategic plans depends upon our success in obtaining a variety of required governmental approvals that may be opposed by third parties. 
- | Closure, reclamation, and rehabilitation costs could be higher than expected, and our insurance and surety bonds for environmental-related issues are limited. 
- | We are subject to federal and state laws that require environmental assessments and the posting of bonds, which add significant costs to our operations and delays in our projects. 
- | Technological advances could render some or all our plans obsolete and adversely affect our ability to compete. 
- | Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or others assert that our operations violate their intellectual property. 
- | Unfavorable economic conditions have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
- | Natural disasters, unusually adverse weather, epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, boycotts and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
- | Illiquidity of investments could impede our ability to respond to changes in economic and other conditions. 
- | Our business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding. 


- | The price of the Company’s common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect the Company and holders of its common stock. 
- | Our stock has historically been a penny stock with trading restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock. 
- | If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
- | We may be delisted if we are unable to maintain the listing standards of the NYSE American stock exchange. 
- | We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
- | We may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future that could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. 
- | Nevada law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. 
- | We have and may continue to pursue investments in other companies, acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or new properties, which could harm our operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.
- | We may undertake joint ventures, investments, projects and other strategic alliances and such undertakings, as well as our existing joint ventures, may be unsuccessful and may have an adverse effect on our business.
