Item 1. Business
Company Overview
BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc.’s (“BigBear.ai” or the “Company”) mission is guiding our customers to realize their best possible future by delivering transformative technologies and expert, actionable advice. Through this mission, we seek to empower people to make the right decisions, at the right time, every time.
BigBear.ai is a leader in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for decision support. We provide our customers with a competitive advantage in a world driven by data that is growing exponentially in terms of volume, variety, and velocity. We believe data – when leveraged effectively – can be a strategic asset for any organization. Through our mission-critical analytics solutions and operational expertise, we help our customers make sense of the world in which they operate, understand how known and previously unforeseen forces impact their operations, and determine which decision and course of action will best achieve their objectives.
BigBear.ai products and services are widely used by government agencies in the United States to support many of the nation’s most critical defense and intelligence capabilities. These customers operate in environments of unrivaled scale and complexity, where the cost of a poor decision can be very steep, and the cost of failure devastating. They demand the most sophisticated and capable AI, ML, and predictive analytics solutions available, from a provider who understands their complex operations and can rapidly deploy technology at scale with uncompromising reliability. 
The need to make sense of enormous volumes of data is not unique to government agencies. Commercial enterprises have spent several decades amassing vast volumes of data, but few have the resources and AI expertise required to turn that data into actionable information for operational decision making. The complexity of integrating disparate, often dirty and incomplete data, and then applying highly technical AI tools to enrich, analyze, and predict outcomes with the data, has limited the adoption of AI for decision support in commercial markets.
At BigBear.ai, we are making AI-powered decision support accessible and scalable for any organization. Our solutions empower businesspeople to leverage more data sources, faster and easier, and to derive new insights hidden in the data – even flawed data – in a way that is visible, understandable, actionable, and trustworthy. As a result, our customers can crystallize and accelerate operational decision making to gain competitive advantage in real-world environments. 
Products and Services
BigBear.ai offers a modular, cloud-based platform that addresses three phases of data-driven decision making: data curation, analysis, and guidance. The capabilities to support each phase are packaged as discrete applications for federal and commercial customers, deployed separately or together, enabling customers to ingest, interpret and visualize vast amounts of data, accurately predict outcomes, and guide decisions to achieve strategic objectives. 
Data curation (delivered as Observe, Brown Bear, and Polar) is used to make data more complete, more accurate, and easier to use in analytics. It collects, normalizes, and integrates historical and real-time data from a wide range of sources, including BigBear.ai data collections, customer proprietary data, and third-party data, to create more holistic insights. Massive data sets containing any variety of text, graphics, video, and other media types, are distilled to identify relevant information associated with the customer’s operating environment, such as asset tracking, geopolitical events, public sentiment, stock market shifts, etc. Through data curation, knowledge is compounded and made more reliable.
Analysis (delivered as Orient and Panda) is used to interpret curated data. It employs storytelling techniques to make predictive analytics more accessible and actionable for decision makers. BigBear.ai provides hundreds of algorithms to uncover objects, activities, or events of interest from the data, applying discovery and visualization to explain patterns and influences that can affect outcomes. Using AI/ML and advanced mathematical models such as tensor completion, data is enriched and mined with depth and agility that far surpasses traditional business intelligence and analytics tools.
Guidance (delivered as Dominate and ARTEMIS) provides goal-oriented advice, allowing customers to state their desired outcomes (goals) and determine what decision or course of action will best produce those results. Users can easily modify 
scenarios to understand the potential impact of each decision option and see the statistical likelihood of each outcome. With this prescriptive guidance, decision makers have clear foresight to act with confidence.
BigBear.ai also offers consulting services to design, customize, deploy, operate, and support our solutions for federal and commercial customers. Due to the breadth and depth of experience and expertise in our team, many of our customers rely on BigBear.ai resources to supplement their technical and operational staff for long-term engagements as well.
Customers
To date, BigBear.ai has predominantly served federal, military, and intelligence agencies of the U.S. government. Our list of marquee customers includes the Joint Staff, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), where our entrenched relationships date back more than 20 years and provide the foundation of our technology and solutions. These customers entrust us with their most critical data and operations and represent most of our historical growth.
The power and agility of our platform and products make them equally valuable to commercial enterprises, particularly those dealing with global market dynamics, such as in manufacturing, supply chain, and commercial space. Landmark customers such as Virgin Orbit and Terran Orbital use our solutions to enrich their satellite architectures with ML-based computer vision models and data pipelines, identifying new insights and opportunities while creating greater value in their commercial offerings.
As new customers are acquired, new data sources, analysis tools, and integrated services are added to the BigBear.ai platform to support new industries and decision scenarios. Thus, every new engagement expands our capability baseline and opens the door to a considerable pipeline of new opportunities within that vertical market and within adjacent markets.
Historically, BigBear.ai has a 93% win rate on new contract opportunities, and a 100% recompete win rate with existing customers. This speaks to the value that our customers find in our solutions and the trust they place in our people to help guide their decisions and courses of action.
Revenue Mix
Approximately 49% of our revenue came from sales of our software solutions in 2021, but this is a change from as recent as 2016 when approximately 1% of the sales of the acquired companies that make up BigBear.ai today were for software solutions. As our software has matured to become a massively scalable, cloud-based solution, both legacy and new customers are transitioning away from exploratory, joint-development engagements toward engagements to quickly integrate and deploy our software for current operational needs.
Due to the sensitive and oftentimes classified nature of our work with government customers, a significant portion of BigBear.ai’s contracts still require our data scientists and software engineers to co-locate on-premises with customers and develop solutions for unique environments and use cases. As a result, these engagements with high levels of non-recurring engineering or research and development (R&D) expense typically yield gross margins between 40% and 50%. However, as we amass knowledge and Intellectual Property (IP), our proprietary products will require considerably less customization and we expect that new engagements will have considerably higher gross margins. While commercial deployments can be on-premises (at a customer’s request), our commercial engagements are largely cloud-based deployments with gross margins that often exceed 60%.
As we evolve our commercial solutions to a pure SaaS model, we anticipate yielding gross margins of 80% or more on that business, comparable to other enterprise SaaS offerings in market. Despite the pivot toward high gross margin, SaaS-based customer engagements, we plan to maintain a portion of our revenue from strategic service-based engagements that will drive innovation and new market opportunities. 
Competitive Advantage
BigBear.ai’s principle competitive advantage is that our products have been designed for – and proven in – highly demanding environments that require exceptional scalability, agility, accessibility, and reliability. The architecture of our platform extends these benefits to customers of all types and sizes. As a result, our customers experience added value from BigBear.ai solutions in these areas:
•Time to Value: The ability to assemble pre-configured analytics without coding, and gain access to a wide range of curated data that has been normalized and distilled “out of the box”, dramatically accelerates deployment and time to 
value. What typically requires months of set up with other decision support tools takes a fraction of time with BigBear.ai products, and users can gain value within minutes of initial login. 
•Business Scope: Our products simplify the complexity that prevents broad adoption of AI-based analytics across business operations and industries. Support for imperfect, diverse data sources enhanced with AI/ML enhances the scope of questions (decisions) that can be addressed, while interactive visualization tools expose and explain new insights in ways non-technical people can easily use. 
•Decision Confidence: The unique combination of data enrichment, insight discovery, comprehensive if-then analysis, and goal-oriented advice provides organizations with a level of certainty in their decision-making, courses of action, and outcomes that they can’t experience with typical analytics products.
•Higher ROI: Through our SaaS offering, customers can scale their usage cost-effectively based on their data and/or processing needs, avoiding the equipment and maintenance costs associated with on-premise solutions. Further, our products are highly interoperable and easily integrated due to our modular platform architecture, so customers can leverage and build on prior technology investments, adding our powerful decision support capabilities to enhance existing operational or business intelligence systems.
Market Opportunity
BigBear.ai serves a large and rapidly growing addressable market. Our technology capabilities and expertise allow us to target a total addressable market (“TAM”) of more than $72 billion, growing to $310 billion by 2026, based upon third-party industry reports on the current and projected markets for government and commercial customers in the following areas: AI platforms, data analytics, and analytic data management and integration platforms. BigBear.ai plans to address this TAM through market penetration with our existing solutions, new vertically focused SaaS offerings, and inorganic portfolio expansion via strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
Growth Strategy
BigBear.ai has multiple growth vectors, including performing on our existing backlog of approximately $466 million as of December 31, 2021, penetrating new federal and commercial markets, and investing in strategic M&A opportunities. Each of these growth vectors is underscored by our “land and expand” sales strategy.
Backlog Execution: BigBear.ai’s existing funded and unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2021, comprised entirely of contracts that BigBear.ai has already won, accounts for approximately 84% of 2022 projected revenue.
Market Expansion: Our largest opportunities lie in commercial and federal intelligence and defense markets where AI/ML technologies are still in the early adoption phase. Commercial customers can also operate under shorter sales cycles and are more apt to engage in pure SaaS/hosted licensing arrangements, requiring considerably less engineering/integration support and resulting in higher gross margins.
While the agility of our products allow them to address customer needs in nearly any industry segment, we will initially focus on commercial markets with similar characteristics to our federal engagements, such as manufacturing, supply chain, and commercial space. After growing our footprint in these markets, we will expand to new verticals and also bring our enhanced SaaS offerings back to the federal market for sale to current and new customers.
Strategic M&A: A critical addition to the growth vectors above is the opportunity for strategic, inorganic growth. Given the importance of our expansion into commercial markets, opportunities that enable or accelerate commercial growth will be our initial priority. We generally pursue M&A opportunities based on:
(1)Additive Technology: The potential to acquire technology that can accelerate growth in a specific commercial market. This can include new or proprietary data sets, market-specific analytics, and novel AI/ML approaches that improve the overall impact of our products.
(2)Market Access: The opportunity to gain a strategic foothold in a high-growth market, thus immediately accelerating our growth in that space.
While we do not currently plan to pursue inorganic growth in our existing defense/intelligence markets, there could be unique opportunities that present enough strategic value to warrant consideration, especially if there is the possibility of acquiring solutions with commercial application or contracts with unserved federal agencies.
Land & Expand: BigBear.ai has executed a successful “land and expand” sales strategy with our customers and has a proven record of growing customer relationships with new products and solutions. Our field team proudly boasts a 100% recompete win rate to date, and we have benefited from several new contract opportunities as a result of referrals made by highly satisfied current customers.
Research and Development:
BigBear.ai has more than 20 years of experience developing and deploying software products. Historically, much of our R&D has been funded and directed by defense and intelligence customers for their specific needs and objectives. The shift toward technical capabilities that could be applied more broadly began in 2019; in 2021 BigBear.ai invested roughly $6 million in R&D activities. These efforts have produced scalable, cloud-based products that are supporting both federal and commercial customers today.
We expect future investments in R&D will largely focus on expanding our robust team of software engineers, data scientists, and cloud engineers to support the following:
1.Evolving our platform to a fully SaaS, mid-market-friendly offering
2.Incorporating new, market-specific data sources into our data curation catalog and processes
3.Creating new analytics modules and workflows for targeted vertical market use cases 
4.Optimizing our guidance capabilities for new business drivers, such as resource allocation/optimization and revenue-generating courses of action 
5.Expanding our cloud infrastructure to support commercial application development
Sales and Marketing
BigBear.ai will go to market with both direct sales and indirect channel partners within each of our targeted sectors, including but not limited to, defense, intelligence, federal civilian, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, and commercial space. We are investing in marketing resources and programs for branding, demand generation, sales/channel enablement, and customer advocacy to develop our marketing and sales funnels and build engagement across the full customer lifecycle. We are also investing in the infrastructure and tools needed to ensure our sales and marketing programs are automated, efficient, and measurable.
Partners
BigBear.ai has strong relationships with cutting-edge technology vendors, such as Elastic, Confluent, KNIME, Qlik, and AWS. These partnerships allow us to deploy our solutions into customer environments quickly and efficiently, decreasing start-up and integration time and costs.
BigBear.ai also manages a channel partner program to share technical training and documents on customer implementations, enabling close collaboration with our 16 channel partners to ensure customer success. Channel partners such as resellers and distributors will be a key component of our go-to-market strategy to enter new vertical markets, as well as for international expansion.
Company Footprint and Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 665 employees, of which over 80% held security clearances. Approximately 36% of our workforce is comprised of software engineers, data scientists, cloud/systems engineers, analysts, and cyber subject-matter experts. 
BigBear.ai has headquarters in Columbia, MD, with additional office locations in Lexington, Massachusetts; Annapolis, Maryland; Ann Arbor Michigan; Chantilly, Virginia; San Diego, California; Madison, Alabama; Charlottesville, Virginia; Virginia Beach, Virginia; McLean, Virginia; and Reston, Virginia. In addition, many of our team members work at secure customer facilities in the U.S.
The BigBear.ai executive team is a driving force behind the company’s success. With strong industry experience and knowledge of both government and commercial markets, our executives are shaping the Company’s vision and market penetration strategies, while ensuring operational excellence. Further, the leadership team is committed to maintaining a corporate culture and employee value proposition that attracts the brightest talent in the industry. 
Competition
Our competitors include software companies that develop horizontal solutions in the analytics, data management, and business intelligence markets, as well as vertically focused analytics tools within our target markets. We also face competition from government contractors and system integrators who are building custom solutions to enter this market. In many cases, we are competing with the internal software development efforts of our potential customers. Organizations frequently attempt to build their own decision support and analytics platforms using a patchwork of custom development, outside consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and significant internal IT resources, before turning to BigBear.ai.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:
•platform agility and product functionality
•data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance
•ease and speed of adoption, use, and deployment
•product innovation and roadmap
•pricing and cost structures
•customer experience, including technical support and education 
•brand awareness and reputation
•track record of success in complex environments
While we compete favorably on these factors, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, broader customer bases, larger sales and marketing budgets, more technology, channel, and distribution partners, wider geographic presence, greater focus in specific vertical markets, lower labor and research and development costs, larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, and develop and introduce new products.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality in the timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the timing of the execution of our contracts, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and our sales cycle is often long and unpredictable” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations and our key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis in future periods and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.” Additionally, recurring delays in the federal government’s budgeting process can adversely affect the award of new contracts or growth on existing contracts during continuing resolutions.
Regulatory
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.
For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, contractual provisions, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights.
We seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection in the United States and abroad; however, we are not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our agreements with customers.
Legal Proceedings
We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against us and we intend to vigorously defend against such matters. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to the success of our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 665 full-time employees, substantially all of which are employed in the United States. We also engage part-time employees, independent contractors, and third-party personnel to supplement our workforce.
None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages due to employee disputes, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Our human capital resources objectives include recruiting, retaining, training, and motivating our personnel. The principal purposes of our incentive compensation policies are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their ability and achieve our objectives. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive culture and environment that encourages active dialogue and robust engagement on the issues most salient to employee satisfaction and believe our employees are empowered to play a significant role in shaping the direction and success of the company.
