Business Overview
 
Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD) is a global digital services and solutions company. Our technology and services power leading information products and online retail destinations around the world. Our solutions help prestigious enterprises harness the power of digital data to re-imagine how they operate and drive performance. We serve publishers, media and information companies, digital retailers, banks, insurance companies, government agencies and many other industries. Founded in 1988, we comprise a team of 5,000 diverse people in eight countries who are dedicated to delivering services and solutions that help the world embrace digital data as a means of enhancing our lives and transforming our businesses. ​​
 
The Company operates in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) and Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS).

Digital Data Solutions (DDS) Segment
 
Our DDS segment provides solutions to digital retailers, information services companies, publishers and enterprises that have one or more of the following broad business requirements: development of digital content (including e-books); development of new digital information products; and operational support of existing digital information products and systems.
 
Many of our clients are driving or are responding to rapid and fundamental changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information. For some of our publishing and information services clients, this means transforming information products from print to digital; for others, it means migrating already-digital products from web-only distribution to multiple-channel distribution that includes mobile and tablet devices and incorporates mobility, social platform and semantic search; and for others still, it means re-tooling pure search-based information products into workflow-embedded analytical tools that combine content with software to enable context-aware decision-making; and for a select number of our information services clients, it means embracing the content-as-a-service model to integrate content with other tools, applications and data. Each of these transformations requires shifts in products, as well as the technology and the operations that support them.
 
For our enterprise publishing clients, changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information often necessitates replacing old processes and technologies that generated static, whole documents with new processes and technologies that enable content to reside as modular components which are re-combined dynamically to create up-to-date, product-specific assembly guides, engineering diagrams/schematics, compliance documentation, field operations guides and clinical documentation destined for simultaneous access on the web, from PCs, tablets and smartphones.
 
By blending consulting, technology and operations sourcing with deep domain expertise, we provide measurable outcomes for publishing companies, information services companies and enterprises through business transformation, accelerating innovation and efficient operations.
 
Information Product Development
 
We help our clients develop high-value information products. Our clients include four of the ten largest information industry companies in the world, spanning financial, legal, healthcare and scientific information. Information and publishing is a $1.6 trillion industry consisting of more than 7,000 publishers, information providers and software service firms worldwide. Many of our clients specialize in the scientific, technical and medical (STM) area (estimated revenues of $137.4 billion) and the legal and regulatory (L&R) area (estimated revenues of $22.7 billion)1.

Both STM and L&R publishers make some or all of their revenues from the sale of information products created from the primary and secondary data produced by professionals and researchers (in the case of STM) or courts, legislatures, administrative bodies and rule-making institutions (in the case of L&R).
 
We enable our clients to rapidly develop new digital products without direct investments in staff, facilities and technology. We embrace agile development methodologies that provide the benefits of early solution visualization and an iterative development process that spans content, technology and user interface development. We use a combination of onsite project management, onshore solutions architecture and offshore globally distributed teams of developers, analysts and subject-matter experts.
 
For example, a leading legal publisher sought to develop a new digital product that would provide lawyers and compliance officers a workflow tool for rule checking, rapid research and fact checking. The new digital tool needed to be accessible via laptops, smart phones and tablet devices. Moreover, it needed to be updated daily to maintain pace with rapid regulatory developments (it was destined to replace a printed loose-leaf series that was updated only monthly). Our technology architects, developers and content analysts designed and implemented the new digital tool within budget and on schedule. Using the new digital tool, lawyers and compliance officers can now confidently react faster to their clients’ increased regulatory burdens with up-to-date information.
 
For another leading global publisher, we developed an eReader application designed specifically for complex professional reference material. The publisher saw an opportunity to increase sales by re-publishing its printed reference works as e-books, but was unable to market them as e-books because existing eReader applications were built for simple fiction and trade books. We developed an eReader application for the client that changed this – it enabled advanced search, linking and cross-references to external sources, subscriber annotations, frequent textual updates and a host of other functions the publisher required in order to distribute its complex reference books as e-books over the iPad® as well as Android® and Windows-enabled mobile devices.
 
Operational Support
 
We help our clients significantly lower the cost of maintaining their high-value information products, applications and systems. Clients for which we perform such services include five of the top ten leading legal, tax and regulatory information providers, three of the top ten credit and financial information providers, and four of the top ten scientific, technical and medical information providers. Relative to information products, our focus is on the underlying “content supply chain” activities that are necessary to maintain the product. These activities often include content aggregation; extraction; encoding; indexing and abstracting; fabrication; and distribution. We deliver these activities on an outsourced basis.
 
For example, for an $8 billion leading provider of financial and news information, we aggregate public source documentation from a variety of government agencies, which we transform, analyze and extract in order to support a real-time, high-value information product.
 
For a leading wholesale textbook distributor, we provided support and maintenance for its digital book platform, including its customizable bookshelf and eReader applications and its conversion and fulfillment processes.
 
Digital Content Supply Chain Strategy
 
We work with clients at a strategic business and technology level to address business process and technology challenges related to digital content supply chain optimization and strategy. By aligning operations and technology with business goals, we help businesses accelerate new product development and introduction; control cost; consolidate and leverage technology investment; and obtain benefits of scale.

For a multinational information services company, we worked in conjunction with the client’s internal teams to design new content architectures and implement new content technologies that enabled the client to migrate its operations away from process and technologies designed primarily for print output to new processes and technologies that were designed around the nature of the content itself and supported multiple simultaneous delivery channels.
 
A global information company had acquired two businesses that each collected, processed and managed some of the same public law content. The company recognized the opportunity to reduce cost by consolidating the processing of this overlapping content. To accomplish this cost savings, we implemented a new, consolidated workflow system using Alfresco and jBPM which provided a common framework for content reuse, while enabling content enrichment processes to be performed by external and internal resources in a fully managed environment.
 
For a publisher of legal treatises and practice guides and provider of on-demand learning, we created a future-state vision of operational workflows required to support an increasing array of technologies and online products. This future-state vision included recommendations regarding process improvements and new technologies.
 
Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) Segment
 
Many enterprises are embracing new digital information technologies and workflow processes within their operations in order to improve internal decision-support systems. We formed our IADS segment in mid-2011 to design and develop new capabilities to enable clients in the financial services, insurance, medical and healthcare sectors to improve decision-support through digital technologies. We believe that by creating and commercializing innovative business strategies and technology solutions we will be able to accelerate our growth and reduce our revenue volatility.
 
IADS operates through two subsidiaries: Synodex and docGenix. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 91% of Synodex and 94% of docGenix.
 
The main focus of the Synodex business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured medical records in an innovative way to provide improved data service capabilities for insurance underwriting, insurance claims, medical records management and clinical trial support services. Synodex has developed and deployed its APS.Extract® product for specific use with life insurance underwriting and claims.
 
At the end of 2017, Synodex had 11 clients, including RGA Reinsurance Company, the principal operating subsidiary of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), one of the top 10 largest providers of life reinsurance in the world according to A.M. Best, and John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. Synodex is engaged in business discussions with other reinsurance companies and insurance carriers that have expressed interest in utilizing its services.
 
The main focus of the docGenix business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured legal documents in order to improve an organization’s ability to analyze documentation and feed actionable data to downstream applications.
 
We offer docGenix services to banks and hedge funds. One of our clients, a large New York-based global investments company party to more than 5,000 derivative contracts, utilizes the docGenix service and software platforms to monitor and react to market changes and counterparty and collateral changes and to comply with increasing regulatory requirements. Prior to utilizing docGenix, these were slow and resource-intensive activities because contract creation, storage and retrieval processes were all still paper or image based. Using docGenix’s system, complex derivative contracts are transformed into machine readable, computer-addressable data that is down-streamed to risk collateral and other mission-critical systems, and users can perform multi-dimensional, complex queries instantaneously.

Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS) Segment
 
Our MIS segment operates through our Agility PR Solutions and Bulldog Reporter subsidiaries. In December 2016, we rebranded the MediaMiser and Agility PR Solutions products under the name Agility PR Solutions.
 
Agility Illuminate (formerly known as Agility Enterprise) provides media monitoring and analysis solutions and professional services to several Fortune 500 companies and Canadian government institutions, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses. Agility Enterprise enables companies to reduce the time and effort required to extract, analyze and share valuable business intelligence from traditional and online media sources.
 
Agility Illuminates’s proprietary technology platform monitors, aggregates, analyzes and distributes summaries of coverage from more than 200,000 content sources including traditional and digital media. The platform includes a powerful sentiment analysis engine that identifies whether opinions expressed in a particular document are positive, negative or neutral.
 
Increasingly, organizations seek to quantify the impact of public relations (PR) and communications activities and to understand what is being said about them across traditional and digital media. Social media has also dramatically changed how organizations manage and respond to crisis. Organizations need to respond quickly to negative customer feedback or coverage and track ongoing conversations in order to protect their brand and reputation. Agility Illuminate, with its powerful analytics and human augmented analysis and reporting, is designed to fit these needs.
 
Agility Connect is a global media contact database and email distribution platform, and Agility Capture provides additional self-service media monitoring and analytics capabilities. We acquired these two Agility products from PR Newswire in July 2016. Together with Agility Illuminate, these products enable Agility to offer self and full-service solutions that address the entire communications life cycle – from identifying influencers, amplifying messages, monitoring coverage, to measuring impact.
 
Bulldog Reporter is a news aggregation service for the PR and corporate communications professionals. Bulldog Reporter publishes a well-known daily e-newsletter, the Daily Dog. In addition, it offers a paid subscription service focused specifically on the health industry, a daily e-newsletter—Inside Health Media—that provides a health-related media list and media intelligence services by leveraging the data from Agility platform. Bulldog Reporter also manages a PR industry awards program—the Bulldog Awards—which recognizes PR and communications professionals in categories including corporate social responsibility, media relations, digital and social marketing, not-for-profit activity and overall outstanding PR performance.
 
With considerable consolidation and slowing growth in the overall media intelligence market, Agility PR Solutions is carving out a niche with a focus on influencer targeting, advanced media analytics and editorially enriched full-service options that provide context and clarity that automated solutions alone cannot provide. This focus on technology as well as customer service differentiates Agility PR Solutions from the clippings-origin and self-service monitoring competitors in the market.

Our delivery centers in Asia are ISO 27001 certified. In addition, we comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (HIPAA) (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), as applicable. Innodata is certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which certification includes Synodex, docGenix, Agility PR Solutions and Bulldog Reporter as covered entities. We encrypt all individual protected health information, both at rest and in motion, to the AES 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features including monitored firewalls and intrusion detection devices.
 
For our data extraction services, we maintain staff in a wide spectrum of disciplines, including medicine, law, engineering, management, finance, science and the humanities.
 
Our services are organized and managed around three vectors: a vertical industry focus, a horizontal service/process focus, and a supportive operations focus.
 
The vertically-aligned groups understand our clients’ businesses and strategic initiatives. The vertical group for each particular industry includes experts hired from that industry.
 
Our service/process-aligned groups include engineering personnel and delivery personnel. Our engineering teams are responsible for creating secure and efficient custom workflows and integrating proprietary and third-party technologies to automate manual processes and improve the consistency and quality of our work product.

Our sales staff, program managers and consultants operate primarily from our North American and European locations, as well as from client sites.
 
Our Opportunity
 
Rapid changes in digital content technologies have created the need for all sorts of companies to refashion their product offerings and their operations. Media, publishing and information services companies contend with new monetization models, delivery platforms, and channels. They seek to develop new digital products as print product revenue wanes; to broaden their markets by distributing content over the iPad®, iPhone®, Android and other portable devices; and to monetize existing content in new, highly targeted custom products through flexible reuse and repurposing.
 
Meanwhile, for enterprises that rely on content to support operations, this shift to digital technology offers opportunities to improve internal decision support and risk mitigation in complex data operations by harnessing the power of machine-readable, digital data to drive improved decision support. For enterprises that rely on content to support products, this shift to digital technology offers opportunities to create and manage content more efficiently, while at the same time distributing content through an increased number of channels.
 
As a result, media, publishing and information services companies, and content-intensive enterprises, are increasingly relying on service providers, such as Innodata, to provide digital content-related services. These services increasingly involve using advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract meaningful data from unstructured data in cost efficient ways.

Clients 
 
Two clients in our DDS segment each generated more than 10% of our total revenues in the 2017 and 2016 fiscal years. In 2017, revenues from Wolters Kluwer affiliated companies (the “WK Clients”) were approximately $11.5 million or 19% of total revenues, and revenues from Reed Elsevier affiliated companies (the “RE Clients”) were approximately $6.7 million, or 11% of total revenues. No other client generated more than 10% of our total revenues in 2017. These two clients together generated approximately 31% of our total revenues in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Revenues from clients located in foreign countries (principally in Europe) accounted for 51% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 49% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients mentioned in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them.
 
Our contractual arrangements with the RE Clients during 2017 consisted of three master services agreements (“MSAs”) and separately agreed to statements of work (“SOWs”) for specific services. Two of the MSAs have indefinite terms and the third MSA has a term that ends on October 31, 2019. RE Clients may terminate the MSAs on notice periods ranging from zero to six months, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods of up to 90 days. They may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of three months or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate two of the MSAs on notice periods of 180 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the RE Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions.
 
Our contractual arrangements with the WK Clients during calendar year 2017 consisted of four MSAs and separately agreed to SOWs for specific services. Two MSAs have indefinite terms, one MSA continues in effect until the completion of all services performed under the MSA, and the fourth MSA has a term that ends on the later of March 2, 2019 or the expiration date of all SOWs issued under the MSA. WK Clients may terminate certain MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods ranging from 10 days to six months. WK Clients may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of 60 days or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate certain of the MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the WK Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions.
 
Our agreements with our other clients are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days' notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our clients is subject to their requirements.

We also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new clients and new client engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to clients.
 
Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective clients. They facilitate interactions between client personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist clients with their goals. For each prospective client engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the client’s goals and collaborate with the client on a solution.
