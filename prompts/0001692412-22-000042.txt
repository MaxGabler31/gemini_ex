Item 1. Business.
Overview
Playa is a leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive resorts in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and/or managed a total portfolio consisting of 22 resorts (8,366 rooms) located in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Playa’s strategy is to leverage its globally recognized brand partnerships and proprietary in-house direct booking capabilities to capitalize on the growing popularity of the all-inclusive resort model and reach first-time all-inclusive consumers in a cost effective manner. We believe that this strategy should position us to generate attractive returns for our shareholders, build lasting relationships with our guests, and enhance the lives of our associates and the communities in which we operate.
We believe that the resorts we own and manage are among the finest all-inclusive resorts in the markets they serve. We believe that our resorts have a competitive advantage due to their location, brand affiliations, extensive amenities, scale and design. Our portfolio is comprised of all-inclusive resorts that share some combination of the following characteristics:
•Prime beachfront locations; 
•Globally recognized U.S. hotel brand partners; 
•Convenient air access from major and secondary North American markets and international gateway markets; 
•Strategic locations in popular vacation destinations with strong local government commitments to tourism; 
•High quality standards and physical condition; and 
•Capacity for further revenues and earnings growth through incremental renovation or repositioning opportunities.
Our all-inclusive resorts provide guests an attractive vacation experience that offers both compelling value and price certainty, while at the same time providing Playa more predictable revenue, expense and occupancy rates than traditional full-service hotel business models. Generally, all-inclusive leisure guests book and pay further in advance, resulting in lower cancellation rates and incremental sales of upgrades, premium services and amenities not included in the all-inclusive package pricing. 
We have strategic relationships with Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham, three of the preeminent globally recognized hotel brands. We believe that partnering with Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham in the development and management of all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America provides us with unique advantages, including the following:
•Access to worldwide reservation systems, global marketing scale, and over 250 million combined hotel loyalty members to drive revenue growth;
•Higher propensity for guests to book direct, which results in significantly improved returns over bookings from wholesale channels such as tour operators and online travel agencies;
•Lower customer acquisition costs, and higher net Average Daily Rates (ADRs);
•Higher net asset value for branded resorts affiliated with global franchisors;
•Brand partners are also focused on maximizing returns;
•Immediate customer recognition for new or converted resorts;
•Significant incremental opportunity with exposure to new consumers, who may not be familiar with the all-inclusive model;
•Access to guests from different regions globally, creating a better segmentation mix, reducing the risk from an owner’s perspective;
•Stronger marketing and public relations presence through affiliate global hospitality brands;
•Branded resorts tend to reduce price sensitivity and encourage purchase decisions, resulting in higher revenues;
•Branded resorts, on average, have higher occupancy than non-branded resorts;
•Branded resorts have higher rates of group business; 
•Branded resorts have lower failure rates; and
•Consumer confidence and trust in globally recognized brands.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed and opened our first ever ground-up development project, the 750-room Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana. We also completed significant renovation work at the 524-room Hilton Playa del Carmen All-Inclusive Resort, 356-room Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Adult Resort and the 418-room Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Family Resort as part of the rebranding and conversion of those respective resorts. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we rebranded two of our existing resorts in Mexico and launched the new Wyndham Alltra all-inclusive brand.
Other resorts in our portfolio operate under the Dreams, Jewel and Sanctuary brands.
We consider each of our resorts to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. For further discussion about our operating segments and financial information about the geographic regions in which we operate, please see Segment Results in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and the public health measures that have been undertaken in response have had and continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economy, the travel and hospitality industries and our business since the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic for a discussion of the impact COVID-19 is having on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners, operators, developers and acquirers of all-inclusive resorts:
•Premier Collection of All-Inclusive Resorts in Highly Desirable Locations. We believe that our portfolio represents a premier collection of all-inclusive resorts. Our award-winning resorts are located in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations, including Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in Mexico, Punta Cana and La Romana in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Guests may conveniently access our resorts from a number of North American and other international gateway markets.
•Diversified Portfolio of All-Inclusive Resorts. We currently operate resorts located in four main geographic markets and feature a range of price points, which we believe diversifies our offering, helps foster loyalty among our guests and drives repeat business. We operate resorts under eight distinct brands. Having multiple brands to offer owners and developers is essential to our ability to secure management agreements and attractive acquisitions since having a portfolio of brands mitigates the risks of brand-on-brand supply growth and subsequent cannibalization and expands our addressable market. 
•Exclusive Focus on the All-Inclusive Model. We believe the all-inclusive resort model is increasing in popularity as more people come to appreciate the benefits of a high-quality vacation experience that offers value, ease of planning and a high degree of cost certainty. Because our guests have pre-purchased their vacation packages, we also have the opportunity to earn incremental revenue if our guests purchase upgrades, premium services and amenities that are not included in the all-inclusive package. 
•Strong Relationships with Top Brands. Our partnerships with Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham, three globally recognized hospitality brands, differentiate our resorts from our competitors. The selection of Playa as a strategic partner of Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham in the development and management of all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America reflects their confidence and conviction in Playa’s best in-class stewardship of all-inclusive resorts. For the year ended December 31, 2021, $457.9 million, or 88.8%, of our Total Net Revenue (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) was generated from resorts under the Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham brands. 
Our strategic relationship with Hyatt under our Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement, as amended, provides us with a range of benefits, including the right to operate certain of our existing resorts under the Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara brands (the “Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands”) in certain countries. In 2021, we entered into an omnibus third amendment to our franchise agreements with Hyatt for our Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara resorts in Mexico and Jamaica which prohibits Hyatt from opening, owning or authorizing other parties (whether under a license or franchise agreement from Hyatt or otherwise) to open or operate Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara resorts in certain agreed upon geographical areas in proximity to our Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara resorts for a five year period after the effective date of the amendment.
Table of Contents

The Hyatt Ziva brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for all-ages and the Hyatt Zilara brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for adults-only. The Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands have access to Hyatt’s low cost and high margin distribution channels, such as Hyatt guests using the World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program (which had over 30 million members as of December 31, 2021), Hyatt’s reservation system, Hyatt’s mobile application and website and Hyatt’s extensive group sales business. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt as well as our company and resort websites.
Our strategic alliance with Hilton affords us the opportunity to expand into markets in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South and Central America while obtaining access to Hilton’s global portfolio of brands and over 128 million Hilton Honors members as of December 31, 2021. We have successfully converted two of our resorts into three Hilton all-inclusive resorts, and under our agreement with Hilton we have the potential to convert, develop or manage up to an additional eight resorts in certain locations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South and Central America by 2025. 
Our strategic alliance with Wyndham affords us the opportunity to obtain access to Wyndham’s global portfolio of brands and over 92 million loyalty members as of December 31, 2021 and provides us with an exclusive right to own or operate Wyndham Alltra all-inclusive resorts for a five year period commencing on December 1, 2021 (the “Brand Launch Date”) in Mexico, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and certain other Caribbean and Latin American destinations (collectively, the “Exclusive Territories”), subject to certain termination rights by Wyndham on the third anniversary of the Brand Launch Date and the extension of our exclusivity right subject to achieving certain development milestones. Our strategic alliance also grants us a right of first offer to manage Wyndham Alltra all-inclusive resorts located outside of the Exclusive Territories during the initial exclusivity period and any extension. During 2021, we successfully converted two of our resorts in Mexico into Wyndham Alltra all-inclusive resorts.
•Proprietary Direct Booking Capabilities. To further support the direct booking benefits of partnering with globally recognized brands, we have invested in our own in-house direct booking platform to optimize our customer acquisition costs and build guest loyalty. These investments allowed our resorts to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic given the slower pace of recovery in wholesale/third-party channels. Bookings generated on playaresorts.com have increased from $16.9 million in 2018 to $107.1 million in 2021 and accounted for 20.9% of our Owned Net Revenue (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) for the year ended December 31, 2021. We will continue to invest in this effort to improve our selling capabilities and adapt to consumer demand.
•Integrated and Scalable Operating Platform. We believe we have developed a scalable resort management platform designed to improve operating efficiency at the 20 resorts we currently manage. Our platform enables us to integrate additional resorts we may acquire, manage resorts owned by third-parties and potentially internalize the management of the two resorts we own but do not manage. Our platform also enables managers of each of our key functions, including sales, marketing and resort management, to observe, analyze, share and respond to trends throughout our portfolio. As a result, we are able to implement management initiatives on a real-time, portfolio-wide basis.
•Advantageous Exposure to Leisure Travel. Our beachfront resort portfolio skews our customer mix to be composed of approximately 90% leisure travelers. We believe that this concentration positions us to recover faster from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and market recessions than many of our lodging peers, as historically the leisure segment of the travel market has tended to rebound faster than the business-oriented segment.
•Focus on Safety Measures. As we adjusted to a new operating environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced the luxury of having expansive footprints, numerous dining outlets, and predominantly outdoor and open designs at the majority of our resorts, which has provided us flexibility to redesign the layout of our resorts with social distancing and safety precautions in mind. Furthermore, we have implemented an enhanced mobile app that incorporates contactless QR codes to augment and facilitate the guest experience at all of our managed properties. We have also incorporated safety practices from our brand partners, government agencies and various health experts to develop our Playa Safe StayTM operating protocols. We believe that our protocols and the association with globally recognized, responsible brands that consumers know and trust are a competitive advantage.
•Experienced Leadership with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team has significant experience in the lodging industry, including operating all-inclusive resorts. 
•Bruce Wardinski, our Chief Executive Officer has over 30 years of experience in the hospitality industry, founded our Predecessor and previously was the Chief Executive Officer of two lodging companies: Barceló Crestline 
Table of Contents

Corporation, an independent hotel owner, lessee and manager; and Crestline Capital Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed hotel owner, lessee and manager. Mr. Wardinski was also the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Highland Hospitality Corporation, an NYSE-listed owner of upscale full-service, premium limited-service and extended-stay properties. Mr. Wardinski held other leadership roles within the industry including Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels and Resorts (NYSE: HST)) and various roles with Marriott International, Inc. As of January 31, 2022, 1.6% of our outstanding ordinary shares were beneficially owned by Mr. Wardinski. 
•Greg Maliassas, our Chief Operating Officer, has over 20 years of experience in the hospitality and lodging industry. Mr. Maliassas previously served as Senior Vice President Operations for the luxury brands of Accor Hotels in Central & Eastern Europe, Benelux and Switzerland, overseeing a portfolio of over 45 hotels.
•Ryan Hymel, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 19 years of experience working within the hospitality sector and is a founding member of our management team, beginning with Playa at its inception in 2006. He previously served as Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Playa and has worked at Barceló Crestline Corporation and Crestline Capital Corporation, two hotel and resort owners and operators. 
•Fernando Mulet, our Chief Investment Officer, has over 19 years of experience in the hospitality industry, and is a founding member of our management team, beginning with Playa at its inception in 2006. Mr. Mulet previously served as the Director of International Investments & Asset Management with Highland Hospitality Corporation and prior to that worked for Barceló Hotels & Resorts.
•Tracy Colden, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, has over 30 years of experience in the hospitality and lodging industry. She previously served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Highland Hospitality Corporation, and as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Crestline Capital Corporation. Ms. Colden was also an Assistant General Counsel at Host Marriott Corporation.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Since the first quarter of 2020, our primary focus has been on responding to the operational, financial and safety challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and that continues to be our primary focus, along with positioning ourselves to capitalize on what we believe to be significant pent-up demand for leisure travel to our markets as the travel restrictions and public health concerns imposed as a result of COVID-19 recede. As conditions continue to improve, our traditional business and growth strategies described below will move to the forefront.
    Our goal is to be the leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive beachfront resorts in the markets we serve and to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns above our cost of capital and create value for our shareholders by implementing the following business and growth strategies:
•Selectively Pursue Strategic Growth Opportunities. The all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry is highly fragmented. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our portfolio through acquisitions and partnerships in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry. We believe that our extensive experience in all-inclusive resort operations, direct booking strategy, brand relationships, acquisition, expansion, renovation, repositioning and rebranding, established and scalable management platform and ability to offer Nasdaq-listed ordinary shares to potential resort sellers will make us a preferred asset acquirer.
•Secure New Management Agreements. We intend to pursue opportunities to capitalize on our scalable and integrated resort management platform and our expertise and experience with managing all-inclusive resorts, by seeking to manage all-inclusive resorts owned by third parties for a fee and to potentially, over time, internalize the management of the resorts we own that are currently managed by a third-party. We will also look to make minority investments in high return projects to obtain management agreements. 
•Utilization of New Technologies and Leverage of Big Data. We utilize numerous technologies aimed at improving guest satisfaction and shareholder returns. Our website uses search engine and metasearch optimization tools aimed at driving direct bookings (i.e., bookings through our website or our brand partner websites), which is our lowest cost customer acquisition channel. As a result, we benefited from more direct business at our Playa-managed resorts in 2020 and 2021. Our percentage of direct stays increased from 37.6% of room nights in 2020 to 47.1% in 2021 and our percentage of direct bookings, including future stays, increased from 47.3% of room nights in 2020 to 49.4% in 2021.
We also launched a new end-to-end technology at select resorts which uses sophisticated algorithms to identify in real-time what upgrades, packages and pricing to offer guests. This enables us to provide guests with several options to enhance their 
Table of Contents

experience, while increasing revenue post-booking. Other new technological innovations underway include our recently launched travel agent portal, which facilitates travel agent bookings without the additional commission layer of a tour and travel operator, as well as the continued launch of our new yield management system, which should maximize guest revenues by optimizing both package rates and channel mix. 
Additionally, by virtue of our partnerships with Hyatt, Hilton, and Wyndham, we have greatly increased our direct access to millions of guests, further enabling us to drive lower customer acquisition costs, bookings and revenues.
•Disposition of non-core assets. We continuously monitor, review and optimize our portfolio to align with our strategic vision and maximize our return on invested capital. As part of this ongoing process, we may sell assets that no longer fit our criteria for capital investment. For example, in May 2020, we completed the sale of the Jewel Dunn’s River Beach Resort & Spa and Jewel Runaway Bay Beach Resort & Waterpark. In February 2021, we completed the sale of the Dreams Puerto Aventuras and in June 2021, we completed the sale of the Capri Resort. We plan to use proceeds from these and other asset sales to pay down debt, reinvest in projects within our existing portfolio or pursue new growth opportunities.
Distribution Channels and Sales and Reservations
Our experienced sales and marketing team uses a strategic sales and marketing program across a variety of distribution channels through which our all-inclusive offerings are sold. Key components of this sales and marketing program include:
•Developing programs aimed at targeting consumers directly through: 
◦Our company and resort websites;
◦The Hyatt website and toll free reservation system; 
◦The World of Hyatt® guest loyalty program; 
◦The Hilton website and toll free reservation system;
◦The Hilton Honors guest loyalty program; 
◦The Wyndham website and toll free reservation system; 
◦The Wyndham Rewards guest loyalty program; and 
◦Our toll free reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory in real time, based on demand; 
•Targeting the primary tour operators and the wholesale market for transient business with a scalable program that supports shoulder and lower-rate seasons while seeking to maximize revenue during high season, which also includes:
◦Engaging in cooperative marketing programs with leading travel industry participants;
◦Participating in travel agent tour operator promotional campaigns; and 
◦Utilizing online travel leaders, such as Expedia and Booking.com, to supplement sales during shoulder and lower-rate seasons;
•Targeting group and incentive markets to seek and grow a strong base of corporate and event business;
•Highlighting destination wedding and honeymoon programs;
•Participating in key industry trade shows targeted to the travel agent and wholesale market;
•Engaging in online and social media, including:
◦Search engine optimization;
◦Targeted online and bounce-back advertising;
Table of Contents

◦Social media presence via channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest; and
◦Flash sales and special offers for high need periods; 
•Monitoring and managing TripAdvisor and other similar consumer sites; and
•Activating a targeted public relations plan to generate positive exposure and awareness in both traditional and digital media.
We also seek luxury transient business to provide high rate business during peak seasons, such as winter and spring holidays, while “bargain hunters” can be targeted for last minute high need periods. This multi-pronged strategy is designed to increase Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) as well as generate strong occupancy through all of the resorts’ seasons.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
Our ESG Committee, which is overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board, is an organization-wide task force with representation from multiple areas of the Company dedicated to obtaining a broader reach for idea generation and effectively promoting best practices and cross-collaboration related to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Our ESG Committee oversees Playa’s commitment to incorporating environmental sustainability, social responsibility and governance into our daily operations at all levels with an emphasis on reducing our environmental impact, mitigating risks, improving our communities and driving value for all our stakeholders. The ESG Committee reports directly to the Nominating and Governance Committee regarding Playa’s activities over corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters and the external reporting thereof (including matters relating to diversity and inclusion). The Nominating and Governance Committee updates the Board on the activities of the ESG Committee.
Our Board and our ESG Committee are focused on cultivating an energetic, engaged and passionate culture that helps each of our employees achieve their own personal goals. Playa supports employees through learning and development opportunities, offering a competitive benefits package and spending time discussing performance and goals of each employee and how Playa can support them in their future. Playa employees understand and take advantage of our Open-Door Policy to communicate suggestions and concerns to Playa’s leadership team. We believe that every individual has a voice that adds value to our organization. By listening to our employees, we learn how to constantly improve and make changes to continuously enhance our working environment.
Environmental
We rely on the beautiful beaches and lush landscapes of our resort destinations to provide a backdrop for our signature service for our guests, and take responsibility to lead the way in our communities in order to sustain these natural environments and help them flourish. Our environmental sustainability program, Playa Green, aims to decrease water and energy consumption, reduce waste, and encourage employees to build and protect our shared communities.
Creating a culture of environmental consciousness with dedicated, focused leadership is of the utmost importance to progressing forward towards Playa’s sustainability objectives. We provide engaging training materials regarding environmental awareness and support our sustainability program with regular performance reviews and sharing of best practices among resort managers.
We seek certifications and alignment with leading verification firms and practices to further enhance our efforts. As such, 14 of our resorts are currently Green Globe certified, with two more underway in the certification process. We use third party energy audits at most of our resorts to monitor our practices and identify areas for improvement and investment. Additionally, we have a designated member of property management (who we refer to as a “Green Leader”) responsible for sustainability performance at each resort.
Social
Our associates and communities form the center of our company. We strive to foster a culture of inclusive growth and provide a respectful and professional workplace to empower all our associates to express what is important to them and to their communities.
We strongly believe that caring for our people is the first step in giving back to our communities. For this reason, we place a large emphasis on employee training and benefits to nurture a compassionate and productive workplace environment. Our comprehensive benefits package helps us attract and retain top talent. Furthermore, we provide ongoing training on safety, antibribery, harassment and discrimination to further nurture the workplace environment. Additionally, we proactively use survey tools and regular performance reviews to engage with our associates and help them achieve their goals and to improve the workplace.
Table of Contents

Outside of the workplace, we do all we can to enrich our communities by partnering with local organizations, volunteering and creating opportunities like internship programs and youth career initiatives. One example of how we care for the communities in which our employees work and live includes the sponsorship of a local school in Jamaica to provide necessities, school supplies and computers, construct and improve facilities, and promote self-sustainability. We also contribute through wetlands restoration, constructing homes for employees, assisting local food banks, and supporting children in group homes and people with disabilities. 
Although we are international in scope, each community has its own unique needs, characteristics and people. We take pride in our positive impact and investments we make in our local communities, including in times of disaster and giving our employees the creative freedom to guide our resources and attention.
Human Capital Resources
Each and every one of our employees plays an integral role in delivering Service From the Heart to our guests and separating us from our competition. “We take care and motivate our employees—and in turn—they take care of our guests with love” is the Company’s official philosophy. We stand behind this statement of taking care of our employees and continuously make their health and safety our top priority, especially amid the ongoing pandemic. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have advanced health and safety measures in place and have implemented new standards and procedures in order to keep employees at all levels of the Company as safe as possible. Furthermore, new protocols and daily health and safety screenings are in place which include temperature checks and COVID-19 tests. All resort staff is provided with proper personal protective equipment according to their tasks and hygiene conditions. Onsite medical consultants are conveniently available for resort employees at no extra cost. Additionally, health insurance is offered to all employees in each of our locations, for both permanent and contract positions. Employees that are not needed onsite, including corporate employees, are encouraged to work remotely with additional technical support and resources provided as needed.
At the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the request of employees throughout the organization, we established the Ernesto Oliver Lopez Memorial Fund in honor of a Playa employee who fell victim to the virus. This fund continues to actively accept donations from employees and community members which directly benefit Playa employees in need, whether that be providing food and necessities for their family or paying health-related expenses.
All Playa employees undergo a comprehensive orientation and training. In addition to health and safety courses that include a specific course for respiratory disease prevention implemented in 2020, we offer continuous learning and development with courses on Playa’s culture, vision and philosophy, guest satisfaction, performance management for leadership, mentoring and coaching, stress management, emotional intelligence, effective interviewing and talent development, high impact teams, conflict resolution and quality management. For example, one growth and development opportunity for our high-potential employees is a talent program. Specific individuals are prepared for future leadership positions within the organization through hands-on training, mentorship and education. All of our resort leadership teams participate in our talent program in order to allow identified employees to be promoted at their resort, at another resort within the country, or be relocated within the Playa organization. This program allows Playa to acquire the best talent, retain and motivate its employees, and succession plan.
The Company places a tremendous emphasis on health and wellness. Throughout the year, employees participate in educational health seminars, special events such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month and wellness programs both in-person and online, depending on the employee’s location. An emphasis is placed on preventative healthcare with special efforts including a mammogram truck for screenings and onsite flu shot distribution. Further, corporate employees are recognized for preventative health screenings, reading health-related articles and participating in educational wellness-related challenges that include eating a nutritionally balanced diet and increasing physical activity. 
As of December 31, 2021, we directly and indirectly employed approximately 12,300 employees worldwide, significantly all of which are located at our resorts and regional offices in Jamaica (2,500), Mexico (5,400), and the Dominican Republic (4,300). We employed approximately 100 employees at our corporate offices in the U.S. and Canada. 
AMResorts Management Agreements
Two of our resorts (Dreams Punta Cana and Dreams Palm Beach) are operated by AMResorts pursuant to management agreements that contain customary terms and conditions, including those related to fees, termination conditions, capital expenditures, transfers of control of parties or transfers of ownership to competitors, sales of the resorts and non-competition and non-solicitation. We pay AMResorts and its affiliates, as operators of these resorts, base management fees and incentive management fees. In addition, we reimburse the operators for some of the costs they incur in the provision of certain centralized services. We could consider selling one or more of these resorts if the opportunity arises and redeploy the proceeds from any such sales, subject to certain restrictions under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). 
Table of Contents

The management agreement for the Dreams Punta Cana will expire in 2022 and the management agreement for the Dreams Palm Beach is scheduled to expire in 2025, subject to our right to terminate the Dreams Palm Beach management agreement without the payment of a termination fee on or after December 31, 2022 by giving at least ninety (90) days prior notice. 
On October 31, 2020, we terminated the management agreement for the Capri Resort, formerly known as the Secrets Capri, with AMResorts, which was subsequently sold in June 2021. In connection with the termination, we agreed to extend the term of the management agreement for Dreams Palm Beach to February 2025.
On February 5, 2021, we completed the sale of the Dreams Puerto Aventuras, which was managed by AMResorts.
Competition
We face intense competition for guests from other participants in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and, to a lesser extent, from traditional hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. The all-inclusive segment remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. Our principal competitors include other operators of all-inclusive resorts and resort companies, such as Barceló Hotels & Resorts, RIU Hotels & Resorts, IBEROSTAR Hotels & Resorts, Karisma Hotels & Resorts, AMResorts (which was recently acquired by Hyatt), Meliá Hotels International, Excellence Resorts, RCD Hotels (Hard Rock Hotels & Resorts), Blue Diamond Resorts and Palace Resorts, as well as some smaller, independent and local owners and operators.
We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities and quality of accommodations. We also compete for guests based on the ability of hotel loyalty program members to earn and redeem loyalty program points at our Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham all-inclusive resorts. We believe that our relationships with Hyatt, Hilton and Wyndham, three globally recognized hotel brand leaders, provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
Additionally, we compete with other U.S. and European global hospitality brands, such as Marriott International, Inc., that have recently entered the all-inclusive segment as a result of increased demand for all-inclusive resort stays. We primarily compete with these global hospitality brands for third-party management contracts.
Seasonality
The seasonality of the lodging industry and the location of our resorts in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic generally result in the greatest demand for our resorts between mid-December and April of each year, yielding higher occupancy levels and package rates during this period. This seasonality in demand has resulted in predictable fluctuations in revenue, results of operations and liquidity, which are consistently higher during the first quarter of each year than in successive quarters. 
The COVID-19 pandemic altered this seasonality trend in both 2020 and 2021 and Net Package ADR was progressively stronger during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021 than it was in the first quarter of 2021 and in prior years. See “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is highly cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in operating performance are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which subsequently affect levels of business and leisure travel. In addition to general economic conditions, new hotel and resort room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance, and over-building has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic recession. Room rates and Occupancy, and thus Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A decline in lodging demand, or increase in lodging supply, could result in returns that are substantially below expectations, or result in losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, many of the costs of running a resort are fixed rather than variable. As a result, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings is likely to be higher than the rate of decline in revenues.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the lodging industry in 2020 and 2021. See “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations.

Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks or trade names that we use or will use in conjunction with the operation of our business, including certain of Hyatt’s, Hilton’s and Wyndham’s intellectual property under their respective strategic alliance and franchise agreements. In the highly competitive lodging industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the success of our business.
Insurance
Our resorts carry what we believe are appropriate levels of insurance coverage for a business operating in the lodging industry in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. This insurance includes coverage for general liability, property, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business and business interruption coverage.
This general liability insurance provides coverage for any claim, including terrorism and hurricane damage, resulting from our operations, goods and services and vehicles. We believe these insurance policies are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers.
Government Regulation 
We have operations and are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information regarding the potential impact of government regulations, including the following risk factors:
