Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing transformative oral therapies to patients with significant unmet medical needs in immunology and oncology. Our proprietary Tailored Covalency® platform enables us to design and develop reversible covalent and irreversible covalent, small molecule inhibitors with potencies and selectivities that we believe will rival those of injectable biologics, but with the convenience of a pill. We have produced three new drug candidates from our platform, resulting in four clinical programs. In November 2018, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 trial of PRN1008, a wholly owned Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase, or BTK, inhibitor for the treatment of pemphigus (pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF)). We retain full, worldwide rights to PRN1008, PRN1371 and our oral immunoproteasome inhibitor program, and have established an 
ongoing collaboration with Sanofi for PRN2246/SAR442168.
 The following chart summarizes the status of the drug candidates in our current pipeline:
 
Our BTK Franchise
 We have developed a BTK inhibitor franchise that encompasses two differentiated oral drug candidates: PRN1008 and PRN2246/SAR442168. Our most advanced drug candidate, PRN1008, is designed to form a reversible covalent bond with the BTK enzyme. This bond confers enhanced selectivity and potential durable potency, which we believe will enable long-term, systemic treatment of chronic immunological disorders. The second drug candidate in our BTK franchise is PRN2246/SAR442168, an irreversible covalent BTK inhibitor that we designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate immune cell function in the brain for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS, and potentially other central nervous system, or CNS, diseases.
 BTK Inhibitor for Immunology: PRN1008
 We are developing PRN1008 for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases, the first of which is pemphigus, a rare, chronic skin disease with a considerable unmet medical need for safe, rapidly acting and effective treatments that do not rely on the significant use of corticosteroids, or CS. The current standard of care for pemphigus typically consists of CS in high doses which may be given in combination with Rituxan, a B cell depleting agent. It is well documented that CS have serious and often long-term morbidities including infections, type II diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular effects, and CS can be associated with mortality as well. We elected to develop PRN1008 for pemphigus in part because it is a generalizable model for other autoantibody-driven diseases.
 2

We initiated a global Phase 3 pivotal trial, the PEGASUS study, of PRN1008 in pemphigus in November 2018. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of PRN1008 is being studied in PV patients, and a smaller number of pemphigus foliaceus, or PF, patients. PRN1008 has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of PV and by the European Commission, for treatment of pemphigus (including both PV and PF). If supported by the trial data, regulatory approvals for pemphigus rather than for PV will be sought in most territories apart from the United States, where an approval for the treatment of PV alone will be sought.
 We have completed an open-label Phase 2 study that enrolled 27 patients with newly diagnosed (mild to moderate) and relapsed (mild to severe) pemphigus PDAI (8-45) (including both PV and PF) according to Shimizu classification (Shimizu et al 2014). In March 2019, this data was presented at the 2019 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting as a late-breaking presentation. Twenty-four patients were treated with oral PRN1008 and low dose corticosteroids (LDCS; <0.5 mg/kg/day) for twelve weeks, with twelve weeks of follow-up. The primary endpoint was control of disease activity (CDA) (where new lesions cease to form, and existing lesions begin to heal) at Week 4. Other secondary endpoints included complete remission rates and reduction in anti-desmoglein autoantibody levels. The study achieved the primary endpoint of CDA on low dose corticosteroids in 54% of patients at Week 4. The CDA results were generally consistent across all major subgroups. At Week 12, CDA occurred in 73% of patients. Of 24 patients who completed the study, after 12 weeks of treatment, 17% achieved a complete response by Week 12 and 25% by Week 24. PRN1008 was generally well-tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment related adverse events were nausea, abdominal pain (upper), headache, and infection in 15%, 11%, 11%, and 11% of patients, respectively. We also have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial extension of PRN1008 in pemphigus patients, which extension increases the active treatment period with PRN1008 from 12 to 24 weeks and we anticipate the top-line results from this trial extension to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Our second clinical program is PRN1008 for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, also known as immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, a rare and often chronic autoimmune disease in which the blood levels of platelets, a key component to normal blood clotting, drop to unsafe levels. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in ITP and have increased the PRN1008 active treatment period from 12 to 24 weeks, with top-line data expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2019. We presented preclinical data in 2017 which indicated that the addition of therapeutically relevant concentrations of PRN1008 did not interfere with normal platelet aggregation responses in blood samples from both healthy volunteers and ITP patients. These results contrast with ibrutinib, the leading marketed BTK inhibitor, which demonstrated in the same preclinical study a significant reduction in platelet aggregation responses in blood samples from healthy volunteers.
 Beyond pemphigus and ITP, we believe there are numerous immunological disorders for which PRN1008 may have therapeutic benefit. PRN1008 has demonstrated clinical and preclinical efficacy in a number of disease-relevant mechanisms, including rapid anti-inflammatory effects, neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies and blockade of production of new autoantibodies. The collective preclinical and clinical data suggests that PRN1008 has the potential to reshape the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
 BTK Inhibitor for CNS Diseases: PRN2246/SAR442168
 PRN2246/SAR442168 is designed to treat MS and potentially other CNS diseases, in part by inhibiting B cells and other immune cells in the brain. During neuro-inflammation, the number of B cells in the brain increases and such increase is thought to play a central role in the pathology of MS and other CNS diseases. In late 2017, we formed a collaboration with Sanofi under which we received a $40.0 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $765.0 million and tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on future sales. In February 2019, Phase 1 data was presented at the 2019 Americas Committee for Treatment and Research In Multiple Sclerosis Annual Meeting. In the Phase 1 trial in over 70 healthy volunteers, PRN2246/SAR442168 was found to be well tolerated at all dose levels studied and all treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in nature. BTK occupancy increased in a dose dependent manner; high levels of peripheral BTK occupancy were achieved after single doses of 30 mg and higher. In the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study, BTK occupancy after 10 days approached maximal levels in the lowest dose group (7.5 mg) studied. In a dedicated arm of the trial (120 mg), human CNS exposure was confirmed in cerebral spinal fluid in all participants in the arm, highlighting the potential for PRN2246/SAR442168 to impact B cell-driven inflammation in both the periphery and CNS. We have received $25.0 million in milestones in 2018 under our agreement. We have completed our development efforts under the early development plan and Sanofi is responsible for further clinical development. We hold an option to fund a portion of Phase 3 development costs in return for, at our discretion, either a profit and loss sharing arrangement within the United States, or an additional worldwide royalty that would result in rates up to the high-teens.

FGFR Inhibitor for Solid Tumors: PRN1371
 PRN1371, an additional wholly owned drug candidate, is an inhibitor of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor, or FGFR, designed for the treatment of solid tumors. FGFR controls tissue homeostasis, or tissue maintenance and regeneration, and is a clinically validated target in multiple solid-tumor indications. We discovered and developed an irreversible FGFR inhibitor to treat FGFR-driven solid tumors, and have completed the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial. With a well-tolerated and pharmacologically active dose now identified, we are studying PRN1371 in bladder cancer. The expansion cohort of our Phase 1 trial is currently evaluating patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma having FGFR 1, 2, 3, or 4 genetic alterations, and we are planning another study for treatment of early bladder cancer, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which has a high rate of FGFR expression.
 Oral Immunoproteasome Program
 We have discovered multiple series of highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. In June 2017, we formed a collaboration with AbbVie Biotechnology Limited, or AbbVie, to develop therapies to bring the power of oral proteasome inhibition safely into the field of immunology for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Under this collaboration agreement, we received a $15.0 million upfront payment in June 2017.  In March 2019, we announced a mutual agreement with AbbVie to end our collaboration
 and to reacquire rights to the program, following an assessment by AbbVie that there is no longer a strategic fit of our highly selective inhibitors’ biologic profiles relative to AbbVie’s desired disease areas of focus.  We and AbbVie have agreed to conclude the collaboration effective March 2019 and there are no further financial obligations between us.
 Tailored Covalency® Platform
 Our proprietary Tailored Covalency platform enables us to reproducibly develop molecules, like PRN1008, which have the potential to be best-in-class and highly differentiated based on their mode of action, selectivity and target residence time. We believe that we can rapidly discover and advance our drug candidates to clinical trials as compared to standard methods. Our approach has the potential to address historically undruggable targets that underlie many diseases with high unmet medical need. We believe that our covalent drug candidates, if approved, will significantly improve treatment paradigms and clinical outcomes for patients.
Leadership
 We are led by an experienced management team with an unwavering commitment and focus on serving patients in immunological and oncological diseases. Collectively, our executives have contributed to the research, development, approval and launch of multiple drugs in both immunology and oncology, including Rituxan, Ocrevus, Xolair, Avastin, Tarceva, Kyprolis, Belatacept, Inflectra Biosimilar and Baloxivir. 
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of highly selective, irreversible and reversible, covalent small molecule drugs focused on immunology and oncology. To achieve this goal, we intend to:

• | Advance PRN1008 through clinical development to commercialization in pemphigus, ITP and other rare immunological disease indications with high unmet need. Based on the interim results from our Phase 2 trial in pemphigus, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 trial of PRN1008 in pemphigus (PV & PF) in November 2018. In parallel, we have initiated a Phase 2 trial of PRN1008 in ITP, and anticipate announcing topline results in the fourth quarter of 2019. We intend to assess one or more additional immunological indications for PRN1008 for future clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to commercialize PRN1008, if approved, by developing our own sales organization targeting dermatologists and hematologists at specialized centers in the United States.

• | Collaborate with our partner Sanofi to advance PRN2246/SAR442168, our BTK inhibitor that we designed to cross the blood-brain barrier, through clinical development for the treatment of MS. In November 2017, we entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Sanofi. We believe that this collaboration maximizes the potential of PRN2246/SAR442168 to address target indications affecting larger populations of patients with CNS diseases. We have completed our development efforts under the early development plan and Sanofi is responsible for further clinical development of this compound in patients suffering from MS. Prior to the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trials for PRN2246/SAR442168, we will decide whether to exercise our option to fund a portion of the development costs of these trials in exchange for additional economic rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop PRN1371, our FGFR inhibitor, for the treatment of bladder cancer. We have initiated the expansion cohort of our Phase 1 trial of PRN1371 in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma having FGFR 1, 2, 3, or 4 genetic alterations and are planning another study for treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, an early bladder cancer, which has a high rate of FGFR expression.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our pipeline by creating additional highly selective, oral drug candidates against important targets in immunology and oncology. We are expanding our wholly owned pipeline by continuing to innovate and discover differentiated oral small molecules with the potential to be best-in-class, and we intend to keep our programs at the forefront of covalent inhibitor drug discovery by investing in new technologies that will broaden the target space of our Tailored Covalency platform. In addition, we plan to explore the new biology discovered with our oral immunoproteasome inhibitors and to select the optimal development path for these highly differentiated assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize collaborations in support of our long-term goals. As we have done with our collaboration with Sanofi, we plan to selectively use collaborations and partnerships as strategic tools to maximize the value of our drug candidates, particularly in indications with large target patient populations.

 Our Approach and Platform—Tailored Covalency
 We are challenging the premise of oral drug design by using our proprietary Tailored Covalency® platform to create therapies that are optimized for residence time, the duration of time that a drug binds to its target. We believe that our platform enables us to purpose-design and develop small molecule inhibitors of enzymes and receptor ligands with potencies and selectivities that rival those of injectable biologics, yet maintain the convenience of a pill. Compared to other small molecules, the properties of our drug candidates have the potential to improve efficacy while minimizing both the off-target effects and total exposure.
 Key properties and potential benefits of our Tailored Covalency platform include:
 

5

To develop our drug candidates, we select highly sought-after targets that have been difficult to inhibit using standard small molecule efforts. Small molecule drugs derive their effect by interacting with target proteins in locations known as binding pockets. Guided by molecular modeling, we design small molecule drug candidates with two components, or keys, that fit the non-covalent features (the first lock) and the covalent elements (the second lock) of the target in the binding pocket. We believe that this “double lock-and-key” solution results in small molecules with high selectivity for their targets, thus reducing off-target activity. In contrast, the single-key solution typical of many standard small molecule drugs may allow the molecule to bind to multiple targets, which can lead to poor selectivity and result in unintended side effects. We believe our double lock-and-key solution has contributed to our ability to purpose-design multiple drug candidates for specific indications.
 The following diagram depicts our double lock-and-key solution:
 

We use proprietary biochemical and cellular assays that are developed in-house to measure and subsequently optimize a drug’s target residence time. Standard small molecule drugs have a short residence time and, therefore, require dosing regimens that sustain minimum concentration levels in the blood at all times to maintain beneficial effects on the target. In preclinical studies, we observed that the drug optimized using biochemical and cellular residence time assays can result in a long residence time in vivo. Our clinical experience with PRN1008, a reversible covalent BTK inhibitor, has further supported this result and confirmed that a low concentration of PRN1008 in blood for just a few hours is sufficient to inhibit, as measured by occupancy, BTK in the desired inhibition range of 60-100% over a period of 24 hours. We believe this minimizes both off-target effects and total exposure of the drug while achieving high clinical benefit.
 6

By optimizing for target residence time, our drug candidates remain bound to the target but otherwise clear the body rapidly, as exemplified in the figure below:
 

Our suite of covalent technologies that we incorporate into our drug designs falls into two general categories that can be used to optimize residence time:
  
• | Reversible covalent compounds have a unique feature where the covalent bond between the inhibitor molecule and the target protein is fully reversible and, thus, does not permanently modify the target protein. Because the covalent bond is fully reversible, off-target binding is transient and of limited consequence. Another benefit of the reversible covalent solution is that the target residence time of the molecule can be tailored. As a result, we can design molecules with varying target residence times, evaluate their efficacies and then select drug candidates based on optimized properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Irreversible covalent compounds are designed to provide maximal occupancy to drive efficacy by permanently inhibiting the target protein. Because the covalent bond between the molecule and the target protein is irreversible, the target protein is permanently modified and, thus, the duration of the inhibition is determined by the length of time that it takes for the body to produce new replacement target proteins. When incorporating this covalent approach, we design drug candidates that require a low daily dosage in order to limit the amount of drug that circulates in the body and, thus, reduce the likelihood of off-target effects, while taking advantage of the additional potency of the irreversible bond.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our proprietary tools enable us to purpose-design drug candidates that are both highly selective and optimized for target residence time. This new approach to small molecule drug discovery is both highly efficient by industry standards and reproducible, as we have produced three new drug candidates, resulting in four clinical programs.
 7

We utilize our proprietary assays to measure target engagement from human tissue, such as blood, confirming that our drug candidates are absorbed and bind to their target following oral dosing. We have leveraged these assays as built-in clinical biomarkers to enable early determination of efficacious exposure requirements for each drug candidate, thus allowing for clear decision points and selection of dose ranges for our clinical trials. We believe the rapid cycle time of our approach leads to a heightened probability of technical success, or PTS, as shown in the following graphic.
 

We are expanding our wholly owned pipeline by continually innovating and discovering additional novel small molecules. We intend to remain at the forefront of covalent drug discovery by investing in new technologies that will expand the druggable target space that is addressable with our Tailored Covalency approach.
 Our Development Programs
 In tailoring molecules for specific diseases, our platform has already yielded a pipeline of orally available, potent and selective drug candidates.
 Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Franchise
 Overview
 Our ability to tailor drug candidates to specific diseases with our Tailored Covalency platform is best illustrated with our BTK inhibitor franchise. The franchise encompasses two potentially transformative oral drug candidates that we have designed to exhibit specific properties. PRN1008 is an oral small molecule with potent and durable action, designed for use as chronic therapy of moderate to serious immunological disorders. PRN2246/SAR442168 is an oral small molecule designed to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach aberrant immune cells inside the CNS with relatively low doses and high potency, to treat MS and a variety of other CNS diseases.
 BTK is present in the signaling pathways of most types of white blood cells except for T cells and plasma cells. Our inhibitors selectively target BTK inside these cells, and inhibition of this enzyme results in the immediate blockade and down-regulation of several cellular activities that drive autoimmunity and inflammation.
 The ability to impact both early and later processes of autoimmunity halts multiple propagators of the autoimmune cascade without depleting B cells. Inhibition of BTK results in rapid anti-inflammatory effects, neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies, and blocks the production of new autoantibodies. Inflammation and autoantibodies are the key drivers in many autoimmune diseases like pemphigus and ITP. The action of BTK inhibition offers broad activity compared to other agents in the treatment of autoimmune diseases without the long-term impact of B cell depletion or the inconvenience of injectable therapies.
 8

We believe this profile of a clinically reversible, targeted-immunomodulation, as shown in the table below, should have broad applicability across multiple immunological diseases:
 

The graphic below illustrates several areas where there is scientific rationale and/or clinical data to support the development of BTK inhibitors as a therapeutic modality. The indications shown in blue represent potential areas where we may choose to further develop our BTK franchise. The indications shown in orange represent areas we would consider pursuing together with a global partner. The indications shown in red represent areas currently well-served by marketed BTK inhibitors.
 

While there are many potential indications for the use of a BTK inhibitor, we have made a strategic decision to focus on developing PRN1008, our wholly owned BTK inhibitor, in high unmet need indications. We have partnered PRN2246/SAR442168, our BTK inhibitor for CNS diseases, with Sanofi in order to maximize its value in indications such as MS, where large clinical development programs are required. We believe that the oncology market for BTK inhibitors is well addressed with currently approved and in-development first-generation BTK inhibitor molecules. While these first-generation BTK inhibitors have made significant contributions to the treatment of hematological malignancies, their adverse effects provided the inspiration for our development of next generation molecules more suitable for the chronic autoimmune diseases we seek to address. Therefore, we will focus our efforts initially on the smaller, orphan autoimmune and inflammatory indications.

PRN1008 for the Treatment of Pemphigus
 We are developing PRN1008 for pemphigus because the characteristics of the disease present an opportunity for PRN1008 to demonstrate its multiple benefits, including rapid anti-inflammatory effects, neutralizing the effects of pathogenic autoantibodies and blocking the production of new autoantibodies without depleting B cells. PV, the predominant type of pemphigus in most countries, is an orphan indication with clinical endpoints suitable for regulatory approval. In March 2019, data from the completed open-label Phase 2 trial of PRN1008 in patients with PV were presented as a Late Breaker at the 2019 American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting. The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2 trial –CDA within four weeks – was reached by more than 50% of patients and PRN1008 was generally well tolerated.  Based on the results of the Phase 2 trial, we initiated the PEGASUS study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial of PRN1008 in patients with moderate to severe pemphigus. We have conducted our Phase 2 pemphigus clinical trial in five non-U.S. countries, and we anticipate that our Phase 3 trial will include patients in over 15 countries, including the United States. In anticipation of seeking broader approvals for pemphigus, including both PV and PF, in territories outside the United States, the trial will include some PF patients, with full statistical power for an analysis of both PV and PF.
 Disease Background
 Pemphigus is a group of rare, potentially life-threatening, chronic diseases characterized by acantholysis, or the loss of intercellular adhesion among keratinocytes, which results in erosions and blisters of the skin and mucous membrane. The major forms of pemphigus are induced by pathogenic autoantibodies acting against intercellular adhesion proteins in the epidermis of skin and mucous membrane called desmosomes. As a result, the upper layer of the epidermis can split away from its base and result in the erosions and blisters characteristic of the disease. Widespread skin and mucous membrane involvement impairs this very important barrier to microbes and can result in life-threatening systemic infections.
 The two major clinical variants are PV and PF. Typically, PV and PF occur in adults between 40 and 60 years old. PV affects both the skin and mucous membrane whereas PF affects only the skin. PV is caused when pathogenic autoantibodies attack dsg-3 or both dsg-3 and dsg-1, and is more prevalent in people of Middle Eastern descent. PF is caused when pathogenic autoantibodies attack dsg-1. The estimated worldwide prevalence of pemphigus is approximately 150,000 to 180,000 patients. Prevalence in the United States is estimated to be approximately 40,000 of which approximately 80% consists of PV patients. Prevalence in Europe is estimated to be approximately 80,000 of which approximately 80% consists of PV patients. Approximately 75% of PV patients, in the United States and Europe, present with moderate or severe PV. Given the fatal nature of this disease, we believe that the majority (90% plus) of these patients require treatment. The current patient population consists mostly of relapsed patients that require ongoing treatment. Worldwide, the annual incidence of new cases has been estimated to be between one and five cases per million of population.
 Limitations of Current Therapies
 The current focus of pemphigus treatment is to decrease blister formation on the skin and mucous membranes and to promote healing of blisters and erosions with the least amount of medication required to achieve disease control. CS are the mainstay of currently available PV therapies. It is well documented that CS have serious and often long-term morbidities including infections, type II diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular effects, and CS can be associated with mortality as well. In patients who are newly diagnosed or those who experience relapses, prednisone, a CS, is typically administered for three to six months or longer until there is control of the disease. After control is achieved, prednisone is gradually tapered and, if required, another immunosuppressive agent, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil, is added to maintain disease control.
 In June 2018, the FDA approved rituximab for the treatment of PV. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 antibody that is administered by infusion and is indicated for the treatment of hematological malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, granulomatous polyangiitis, or GPA, and microscopic polyangiitis, or MPA. Anti-CD20 antibodies act by depleting B cells, a process that takes several months and requires an initial concomitant administration of high-dose CS. The associated risks are primarily severe infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, and rare and serious infections that can be fatal. Furthermore, the long-term risks of chronic B cell depletion have not been fully characterized.
 10

Our Solution
 PRN1008, an orally administered BTK inhibitor, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly induce clinical responses in the majority of patients independent of stage, severity, or duration of disease without the use of high-dose CS and their associated toxicities. Furthermore, PRN1008 delivers these benefits without affecting T cells or causing chronic B cell depletion (thus retaining most immune functions) and with reversibility of drug effects upon dose interruption. These attributes could make PRN1008 a first-in-class oral treatment for this debilitating orphan disease.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PRN1008 in Pemphigus
 We have completed our open-label Phase 2 clinical trial, Believe-PV, to evaluate PRN1008’s potential to induce rapid onset of clinical response, enable tapering of CS, and lower autoantibody levels. Phase 2 measured the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of PRN1008 in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing, biopsy-proven, mild or severe PV (Pemphigus Disease Activity Index, or PDAI, of 8 to 45) for whom an initial period of PRN1008 monotherapy or combination with low doses of CS was judged to be clinically acceptable. PRN1008 has been administered orally to patients with pemphigus, most of whom had PV confirmed by anti-desmoglein 3 antibodies, and a small number of whom, although originally diagnosed with PV, had a PF antibody profile. The Phase 2 trial had a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up period of 12 weeks. We have initiated a Phase 2 extension to this trial that increased the active treatment period to 24 weeks, with a follow-up period of four weeks and allows more severe PDAI scores up to 60. We are conducting the trial at several global sites outside the United States. 
 The clinical efficacy endpoints of the Phase 2 clinical trial are based on global pemphigus guidelines, including control of disease activity, or CDA, where new lesions have stopped appearing and established lesions begin to heal, and complete remission, or clinical CR, where all lesions are healed. Quantitative disease scores such as the PDAI, and Autoimmune Blistering Quality of Life, or ABQOL, are measured at each visit, as well as BTK occupancy in circulating white blood cells. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients able to achieve CDA on ≤ 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent CS (so-called “low-dose” CS in the blistering diseases field) by the Day 29 visit.
 The patient demographics of this Phase 2 trial are highly representative of a mixed population of newly diagnosed and relapsing pemphigus patients. The mean age is 52 years old (37-72) with an average disease duration of six years (range 0-25) and PDAI score of 19 points (range 8-43). Average body mass index was 27 kg/m2 (range 20-38). Similar numbers of men and women were studied (56% female). There were more relapsing patients (n=18) than newly diagnosed (n=9). The mean dose of CS at trial entry was 14 mg (range 0-30). Among the population studied, anti-dsg3 antibody levels confirmed the diagnosis of PV in 23 (85%) patients. One (4%) patient was autoantibody negative, and three (11%) patients had only positive anti-dsg1 antibodies, suggesting a diagnosis of PF and not PV. Three of 27 patients had their dose of PRN1008 increased to 500 mg or 600 mg twice daily in response to increased disease activity, with all other patients remaining on 400 mg twice daily throughout the study.
 
11

In this trial, 14 of 26 (54%) patients treated with PRN1008 met the primary endpoint of CDA on zero or low-dose CS by the Day 29 visit. Two of 26 (8%) patients achieved CDA on zero CS by the Day 29 visit, demonstrating activity of PRN1008 without any CS. Four of 24 (17%) patients who completed the study had achieved CR on low-dose CS by the Day 85 visit. 
 
12


For the clinical CR, as seen in the image above, the mean dose of CS was 8 mg with a range from 1 to 20 mg. Key secondary endpoints had a median anti-DSG antibodies reduced by up to 65%, a median clinical CR duration after PRN1008 cessation of approximately two months, and the time to relapse from CDA/CR at the end of the 12 weeks of therapy was from 27 up to greater than 99 days. 
 
PRN1008 was observed to lower both anti-dsg1 and anti-dsg3 levels, the two most prevalent pathogenic autoantibodies in patients with pemphigus. This effect was seen as early as the Day 29 visit. Furthermore, in most patients with initially elevated anti-dsg3, levels remained suppressed after cessation of PRN1008 treatment, suggesting a sustained effect beyond the 12-week period of PRN1008 treatment on patients’ pemphigus-associated pathogenic autoantibodies.
 
13

Efficacy after four weeks of treatment was consistently seen across all subgroups with the exception of the one anti-desmoglein antibody-negative patient and three patients with a PF antibody profile, as shown in the figure below. At week 12, two of the three PF patients had later clinical responses, on low-dose CS. In addition, at week 12, we saw an increase proportion of CDA achieved across the different subgroups that include relapsed PV patients.
 
Consistent with the observations from the Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers, PRN1008 has been well-tolerated in this pemphigus trial. No clinically significant laboratory, vital signs and/or electrocardiographic signals were observed. No treatment-related deaths, or adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported.
 Three serious adverse events have been reported, only one of which was deemed by the investigator to be related to PRN1008. The related event was a Grade 3 event of cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection that led to hospitalization and dose interruption for three days. The patient was retreated for a further two months without event recurrence.
 The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, independent of causality, nausea (22%), headache (15%), abdominal pain upper (11%) and diarrhea (11%). The most frequent TEAEs deemed by the investigator to be related to PRN1008 therapy were nausea (15%), abdominal pain (upper) (11%),  headache (11%) and infection (11%)— all mild or moderate in severity with the exception of one event of cellulitis that resolved. Two patients on chronic anticoagulation medication (rivaroxaban) have been treated without bleeding complications. TEAEs are summarized in the table below.

In this trial, we observed no reported incidences of major hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia - events that have been reported with marketed BTK inhibitors.

Analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints revealed therapeutic levels of BTK occupancy in peripheral white blood cells in all but one patient; the pre-dose average at steady state was 78% (pre-dose target was ≥ 70-80%) and the average Day 1, 2-hour post-dose BTK occupancy was 82%. As would be expected due to the rapid systemic clearance and slow off-rate kinetics of PRN1008 from its target, plasma concentrations at trough (approximately 12 hours post-dose) were minimal while BTK occupancies remained high.
 Canine Study of PRN1008 Monotherapy in Pemphigus Foliaceus
 Because pemphigus naturally occurs in both humans and dogs, primarily affecting the skin and paws of the dog, we were able to conduct a clinical trial of PRN1008 in PF dogs. This canine clinical trial demonstrated the effects of PRN1008 as a monotherapy without the need for the usual care of CS, and the PDAI results shown in the graph below were similar to the results of our Phase 2 human clinical trial in pemphigus. The images of Dog #1 show progression over the course of the trial.

Design of the Phase 3 Clinical Trial of PRN1008 in Pemphigus
 We initiated the PEGASUS study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial of PRN1008 in approximately 120 patients with moderate to severe pemphigus. This trial will evaluate PRN1008 versus placebo, using a background treatment of tapering doses of prednisone. The trial entry criteria include patients with moderate to severe pemphigus who are either newly diagnosed or relapsing with chronic disease. The demographics of this trial are anticipated to be similar to the Phase 2 trial which included a majority of PV patients and a small number of PF patients. This demographic will potentially represent three quarters of the pemphigus patient population. The primary endpoint will be the ability of PRN1008 to achieve durable CR on very low-dose prednisone ( ≤ 5 mg) after 36 weeks of treatment. Durable CR is defined as a state in which all lesions have healed and no new lesions have appeared for a period of at least eight weeks. Key secondary endpoints include cumulative CS use, time to CR, and durable CR on ≤ 10 mg CS. After 36 weeks, patients will be allowed to be treated with active PRN1008 therapy in an open-label extension period of 24 weeks. The trial size of the Phase 3 is similar to those of two recent randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trials investigating rituximab and ofatumumab in PV. Primary endpoint effect sizes are calculated by extrapolation of our Phase 2 data and recent historical data for rituximab as compared to placebo on a background of tapering prednisone. The clinical trial has been designed with an estimated statistical power of greater than 90%. We also plan to conduct an open-label safety trial, which will enroll patients from both the Phase 3 and prior Phase 2 trial who wish to continue treatment with PRN1008.
 PRN1008 for the Treatment of ITP
 We also are developing PRN1008 for the treatment of ITP. We believe there is a strong mechanistic rationale for BTK inhibition to be disease modifying in ITP. Furthermore, PRN1008 has demonstrated that it did not impact platelet aggregation in blood samples from either normal healthy volunteers or ITP patients, thereby potentially avoiding the bleeding and bruising risk typically associated with other BTK inhibitors.
 16

Disease Background
 ITP is a rare and often chronic autoimmune disease where blood levels of platelets, a key component in normal blood clotting, drop to very low levels. Similar to pemphigus, ITP is an autoimmune disease driven by pathogenic autoantibodies. In the case of ITP, these pathogenic autoantibodies are targeting platelet glycoproteins. Autoantibody binding results in Fc g receptor-mediated destruction of platelets primarily by macrophages. Increased levels of circulating B cells excreting platelet glycoprotein antibodies have been reported in ITP patients. ITP patients have been observed to have increased levels of circulating B cells excreting platelet glycoprotein. While ITP patients can be asymptomatic, they often have episodic nose and gum bleeding, frequent bruising and significant fatigue. Primary ITP, also known as idiopathic, occurs when ITP develops for no known reason. Secondary ITP is associated with other illnesses such as an infection or autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, or occurs after transfusion or taking certain drugs, for example, certain drugs used to treat cancer. Patients also endure a poor quality of life due to the need to limit activities and monitor blood parameters to decrease the risk of serious bleeding. In 2018, according to a survey of 1,300 ITP patients published at the European Hematology Association, 36% of patients said having ITP had a high impact on their emotional well-being, severe fatigue being the most difficult impact for these patients to manage from an emotional perspective. The most severe medical issue in these patients was intracranial bleeds, which can be fatal. In cases of severe ITP, the five-year mortality rate due to intracranial bleeding in patients over 60 years of age is 47.8%, according to a retrospective study on bleeding risk with ITP published in the Archives of Internal Medicine.
 While most pediatric cases go into spontaneous remission within six to 12 months, the majority of adult cases progress to chronic ITP, according to an international working group for ITP published by Blood. Worldwide, the incidence has been estimated to be between 10 and 20 cases per hundred thousand of population. There are approximately 330,000 people living with primary and secondary ITP in the United States and Europe, including approximately 70,000 people with chronic primary ITP in the United States and almost 90,000 in Europe. In addition, there are over 30,000 people living with chronic secondary ITP in the United States and 36,000 people living in Europe. Approximately 90% of chronic ITP patients continue to need additional therapy. Patients must be treated if their platelet levels drop to below 30,000 per mm 3 to avoid potentially fatal intracranial bleeds; however most physicians treat patients if their platelet levels drop to between 50,000 to 60,000 per mm3. The optimal treatment for the vast majority of patients with chronic ITP is determined by their platelet level responses. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies
 Current ITP therapy is divided into two distinct groups: first-line treatment to treat acute episodes of the disease, which typically last less than six months, and second-line therapy for chronic treatment and control of the disease. There is no current option that provides a safe and effective therapy that can be used to manage episodes, control the disease and prevent flares with chronic treatment.
 First-Line Treatments: A short course of CS or a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIg, is typically used as a first-line treatment. While initial responses to CS offer a rapid onset of efficacy and a high initial response rate, at least 50% of patients ultimately relapse following tapering and will require additional therapy. It is well documented that CS have serious and often long-term morbidities, including serious infections, type II diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular effects and can be associated with mortality as well. IVIg is often used as rescue therapy when platelet levels are extremely low to avoid immediate bleeding risks. However, it is not commonly used for chronic therapy due to its transient effects, significant toxicities, IV administration and high cost of treatment.
 Second-Line Treatments and Beyond: There are several treatments used in chronic ITP. Nearly all patients receive treatment based on their platelet counts and symptoms, according to American Society of Hematology guidelines. Most patients receive either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, or TPO-RA, or rituximab as second-line, and then are treated upon relapse with whichever of those two drugs was not used initially. Splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen, was once considered to be the standard of care for second-line treatment of ITP. However, due to the surgical risks and the lifetime heightened risk of serious bacterial infections it has been replaced by TPO-RA, a class of drugs that are aimed at increasing platelet production but have no ability to stop platelet destruction. Currently, there are two approved TPO-RA, romiplostim, a weekly subcutaneous injection, and eltombopag, a daily oral tablet. Rituximab is often used off-label as a second-line treatment for ITP in adults due to its strong short-term response rates. However, poor long-term efficacy and unknown safety are considered to be drawbacks. Recently, the FDA approved fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate, an oral inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase, or Syk. In its clinical program, fostamatinib has demonstrated efficacy in about 18% of patients and has been associated with diarrhea, hypertension, liver toxicity, neutropenia and fetal toxicity.
 17

The key unmet needs in ITP are treatments that work beyond first line and have better durability and a more rapid onset. Currently available treatment options are limited by short duration of response and safety concerns, leaving significant numbers of ITP patients without reasonable treatment options. While the introduction of TPO-RA has been very advantageous, there are few options that effectively target the underlying cause of ITP in the majority of patients, pathogenic antibody production, and subsequently stop destruction of platelets and prevent low platelet production. The current treatments that target pathogenic autoantibodies are limited by toxicities, route of administration (IV), relapse rates and risk of infection.
 Our Solution
 We are developing PRN1008 as an oral drug for the treatment of primary and secondary ITP. We believe that PRN1008 is highly suited to address the most common underlying cause of ITP—pathogenic autoantibodies—through prevention of Fc g—mediated destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies and the blocking of the production of new autoantibodies, without depleting B cells. These mechanisms have been shown to stop the platelet destruction that otherwise results in low platelet counts in ITP patients. Thus, we believe PRN1008 has the potential to be an effective oral drug that reduces the untoward effects often seen with more invasive or broader immune suppression. In contrast to other BTK inhibitors, PRN1008 has demonstrated that it did not impact platelet aggregation in blood samples from either normal healthy volunteers or ITP patients.
 Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PRN1008 in ITP
 We are conducting an open-label adaptive Phase 2 trial in up to 24 patients with relapsed primary or secondary ITP who have no other approved or available treatment options and two or more recorded platelet counts <30,000 per mm3 at study entry. Patients are dosed orally with active therapy for 24 weeks, after which there will be a 4 week follow-up period to determine safety, PK, PD and durability. Intra-patient dose-escalation is permitted every 28 days depending on clinical response, with four dosing levels studied. Dosing levels include 200 mg daily, 400 mg daily, 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily. This Phase 2 trial is being conducted at multiple sites in the United States and Europe. This trial will inform the Phase 3 trial design and a potential path to approval
 PRN2246/SAR442168 for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis
 We designed PRN2246/SAR442168, our second BTK inhibitor in clinical development, as a potential therapy for diseases characterized by neuro-inflammation. PRN2246/SAR442168 is an oral, irreversible covalent BTK inhibitor that was designed to access the brain and spinal cord by crossing the blood-brain barrier and, subsequently, to impact local immune cells within the CNS, including B cells. We have entered into a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for development of PRN2246/SAR442168, have completed our Phase 1 clinical trial of PRN2246/SAR442168, and have confirmed human CNS exposure in a dedicated arm of that trial.
 Collaboration with Sanofi
 In November 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanofi, or the Sanofi Agreement, for the development of PRN2246/SAR442168 in MS and potentially other CNS diseases. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we were responsible for completing Phase 1, and Sanofi is responsible for all further clinical development activities.
 In December 2017, we received a $40.0 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to an aggregate of $765.0 million as well as royalties up to the mid-teens. We hold an option to fund a portion of Phase 3 development costs in return for, at our discretion, either a profit and loss sharing arrangement within the United States, or an additional worldwide royalty that would result in rates up to the high-teens. In May 2018, we amended the Sanofi Agreement to include additional activities under the early development plan and to modify the definition of one of the milestone payments. In 2018, we received a total of $25.0 million for the achievement of multiple early development milestones.

Disease Background
 MS is considered an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that leads to attacks on the surrounding covers of nerve cells, known as the myelin sheath. The disease is characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration that manifests clinically as worsening physical disability and other deficits. Although the precise etiology of MS remains unclear, the key pathophysiology is the formation of lesions caused by an aberrant inflammatory cascade. Clinical symptoms include numbness, difficulty walking, visual loss, loss of coordination and muscle weakness. The course of MS is highly varied and unpredictable. About 45% of patients experience ambulatory or walking impairment after the onset of the disease. Many components of the immune system are involved in the disease, including T cells, cytokines and B cells. B cells in the CNS are linked to severity of disease and may be due to chronic, inflammation-inducing B cell generating tissue in the CNS. BTK is critical for B cell differentiation, activation and maturation and also regulates the activation of other immune cells in the periphery and CNS.
 Approximately 400,000 patients suffer from MS in the United States and globally there are approximately 2.3 million diagnosed patients, approximately 50% of whom are treated with drug therapy. The size of the MS market is expected to be approximately $24.0 billion in 2025. Recent advances in the understanding of MS has evolved the terms in which the disease is described and to focus on the more unmet need areas of progression and inflammation.
 Limitations of Current Therapies
 Current treatments primarily target cytokine behavior; suppress T cell activation, proliferation, migration, and CNS infiltration; and inhibit B cell activity. These therapies have demonstrated efficacy predominantly in patients whose disease is characterized by an active inflammatory component—mainly relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS, and relapsing secondary progressive MS, or SPMS—but have proven less effective in patients with primary progressive MS, or PPMS. Optimal management of MS should target inflammation on both sides of the blood-brain barrier. Most drugs are more efficacious in RRMS and generally target T cell activation and cytokines. To date the only approved therapy for PPMS is the recently approved B cell–depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab.
Our Solution
 The role of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS has been clinically validated through the successful clinical use of ocrelizumab, which selectively depletes peripheral CD20-expressing B cells. B cells increase in number in the brain during neuro-inflammation, and they are thought to play a central role in MS pathology through multiple mechanisms including antigen presentation, cytokine secretion and antibody production. The second validation of the mechanism comes from a Merck KGaA Phase 2 trial studying the BTK inhibitor, evobrutinib, in relapsing MS patients that met its primary endpoint of clinically meaningful reductions of gadolinium-containing contrast agents when compared to placebo. Gadolinium normally cannot pass from the bloodstream into the brain or spinal cord due to the blood-brain barrier, but during active inflammation within the brain or spinal cord, as during an MS relapse, the blood-brain barrier is disrupted, allowing gadolinium to pass through and mark areas of active inflammation. In data presented at ACTRIMS 2019, Dallas TX, evobrutinib 75 mg QD and BID significantly reduced the number of T1 Gd+ lesions vs placebo in patients with active RMS (relapsing MS) over 24 weeks of treatment. A trend towards a reduction in ARR (annual relapse rate) was seen with evobrutinib 75mg QD and BID. A dose response relationship was observed for both measures. These results would seem to represent clinical proof of concept for a BTK inhibitor in the treatment of MS.
 Accumulating evidence also suggests that microglial cells play a critical role in the inflammatory cascade in neuro-inflammatory disorders and preclinical studies demonstrated the importance of the microglial function in antibody-mediated demyelination. Thus, penetration of the CNS and periphery would give PRN2246/SAR442168 the potential to target multiple pathways involved in the initiation and propagation of CNS inflammation and autoimmune diseases such as MS. As an oral drug candidate designed to reach not only peripheral but also central pathogenic autoantibodies within the CNS, we believe PRN2246/SAR442168 represents a unique opportunity to affect this devastating disease.
 19

B cells are key drivers in MS, regulating autoimmunity and neuro-inflammatory responses. The action of BTK inhibition on both sides of the blood-brain barrier potentially offers broad activity, compared to other agents in the treatment of MS, to target systemic autoimmunity and local CNS inflammation. This profile of a targeted CNS penetrant immunosuppressive, as shown in the table below, may have broad applicability in MS and across other neuro-inflammatory diseases.
 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRN2246/SAR442168
 The Phase 1 trial was a first-in-human randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of five single ascending dose, or SAD, cohorts (5 to 120 mg), and five multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts (7.5 to 90 mg once daily) of PRN2246/SAR442168 in healthy subjects. Secondary objectives included assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK) and a pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of peripheral BTK occupancy. The study enrolled 94 subjects, 74 of whom received study drug while the remaining 20 subjects received placebo.  The MAD cohorts consisted of ten days of treatment. In an additional cohort, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) exposure was measured through lumbar puncture after a single 120 mg dose. The data was presented at the 2019 American Consortium for Therapy and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) annual meeting.  
 20


PRN2246/SAR442168 exposure increased with dose and with the expected rapid absorption and clearance profile. BTK occupancy increased in a dose dependent manner—high levels of peripheral BTK occupancy were achieved after single doses of 30 mg and higher. In the MAD portion of the study, after 10 days, BTK occupancy approached maximal levels in the lowest dose group (7.5 mg) studied.  CSF exposure was achieved in all subjects who underwent lumbar puncture, confirming blood-brain barrier permeability. The potential to impact B cell driven inflammation in the CNS will be evaluated in the next phase of development. PRN2246/SAR442168 was well tolerated in the study, with all treatment related events being mild in nature (Grade 1). There were no clinically significant or drug related changes in vital signs, ECG parameters, or laboratory values except for one mild treatment related event of decreased platelet count in a participant that presented with low (not clinically significant) platelet values at screening. Study drug was withdrawn following dosing on day 9 and the AE was considered resolved 15 days after onset. 

Preclinical data
 In preclinical studies, we observed effects on disease-relevant B cell and Fc-mediated mechanisms, which we believe support the rationale for use of PRN2246/SAR442168 in the treatment of MS. We observed dose-dependent protection from disease induction in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, a neuro-inflammatory model with similarities to human MS, with durable BTK target occupancy confirmed for up to 24 hours in both the periphery and CNS of treated mice. We believe these results provide evidence that PRN2246/SAR442168 has the potential to address both peripheral and neuro-inflammation driven by B cells, macrophages and microglia.
 PRN1371 FGFR Inhibitor Program
 We believe that complete inhibition of an oncogenic target is necessary for the treatment of cancer, and that next-generation, irreversible covalent drugs have typically out-performed the traditional, reversible predecessors. Furthermore, we used our Tailored Covalency approach to design PRN1371, an oral irreversible inhibitor, to be highly selective for fibroblast growth factor receptors, or FGFR, 1-4 in order to avoid the toxicities that have plagued many of the previous FGFR inhibitors and potentially limited their utility. 
 21

Disease Background FGFR in Solid Tumors
 Multiple solid tumor types are associated with alterations of FGFR. Patients with tumors harboring such genetic alterations can readily be identified with commercially available genetic tests, making this mechanism an excellent candidate for targeted therapy. FGFR as a therapeutic intervention has been clinically validated in bladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma and has shown activity in a number of other tumors including head and neck, gastric and lung cancer. The percentage of patients with FGFR alterations in these tumor types varies from low single digits to the mid-teens with FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations and fusions being the most susceptible to monotherapy with FGFR inhibitors.
 Early-stage bladder cancer has the highest percentage of patients with FGFR alterations between 60% and 80% of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC, patients. According to the American Cancer Society and the SEER database, the annual United States incidence of NMIBC diagnosis is approximately 60,000 people, with approximately 500,000 people currently living with NMIBC in the United States. This area of bladder cancer also represents an opportunity to explore the role of FGFR alterations in the microenvironment of tumors and determine if FGFR inhibition may improve responsiveness to checkpoint inhibition and other cancer immune therapies.
 Limitations of Current Therapies
 Many of the patients that could benefit from FGFR therapy today are either treated by chemotherapy or cancer immune therapies. Most of those therapies are effective but not curative and come with significant safety and tolerability risks. FGFR targeted therapies provide an alternative treatment of cancer for patients with mutations or fusions of this protein as they attack the specific alteration that drives the cancer and are more selective in their approach. Specifically, blocking FGFR alterations in FGFR driven tumors might provide higher efficacy and less toxicity for patients. Most pan-kinase inhibitors and reversible selective FGFR inhibitors that are currently in development have significant off-target effects that may limit their clinical utility. A significant unmet need remains for a highly selective well tolerated FGFR inhibitor that has the ability to fully inhibit this pathway in patients with an FGFR driven tumor. For NMIBM, the most common form of treating this type of cancer in the United States is to have frequent bladder visualization and tumor resection procedures, called cystoscopy, which has resulted in bladder cancer being one of the most costly forms of cancer to treat.
Our Solution
 The dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1 trial in an “all-comer” metastatic oncology patient population has identified a well-tolerated 35 mg daily dose with favorable pharmacodynamic data to advance into future clinical trials in solid tumors, with an initial focus on metastatic bladder cancer. The irreversible covalent binding allows for a highly potent effect on the target protein, and we believe that the selectivity profile of PRN1371 has led to the enhanced tolerability observed to date. While there were no partial responses, several of the stable disease patients remained on treatment for over 12 months, suggesting both sustained benefit for these highly pre-treated patients, as well as tolerability of the drug.
 With a well-tolerated and pharmacologically active dose now identified, we intend to initially study PRN1371 in early- and late-stage bladder cancer. The ongoing two-part, Phase 1 trial has completed the dose escalation portion of the trial and a dose has been selected for the second part of the trial, an expansion cohort in FGFR mutated or translocated metastatic bladder cancer to demonstrate efficacy in a known FGFR-responsive setting and to explore the sub-group of patients who have failed prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy.  The trial’s expansion cohort was initiated in November 2018. In addition, based on the observed pharmacodynamics of PRN1371 and high FGFR alteration rate of between 60 to 80% in NMIBC, we are planning another trial of PRN1371 for the treatment of NMIBC. A study in low- to medium-risk NMIBC patients prior to papillary tumor resection would assess PRN1371 efficacy and may allow further exploration of the impact on tumor microenvironment.
 Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Efficacy and Safety
 Length of treatment of the 36 patients dosed in the dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1 trial varied from days to well over 12 months in several patients. As of December 31, 2018, 34 patients have completed dosing and two continue in the trial.   
 22

In the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial, PRN1371 was rapidly absorbed following oral administration and rapidly cleared from the body, with a short plasma half-life of approximately one and a half hours. Robust increases of greater than 60% in the biomarker of serum phosphate were seen at the recommended expansion cohort dose of 35 mg daily. 
 Insufficient numbers of patients who have the appropriate FGFR alterations have been studied to form any firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Twelve patients that received PRN1371 for more than two cycles had a FGFR fusion, mutation or high mRNA level. Of these patients, none had a formal partial response, or PR, and 10 of 12 (83%) had stable disease, including some patients with partial tumor regression.    
 As of August 2018, administration of PRN1371 daily doses up to 35 mg was well-tolerated, with the higher dose level of 25 mg twice daily having noticeably more adverse events. Six of the 26 serious adverse events, or SAEs, occurring in five patients were deemed by the investigator to be related to PRN1371. Five were seen with twice-daily dosing and included nausea (n=2), vomiting, creatinine increase, and depressed level of consciousness, and one was seen with a daily dose of 35 mg with subcapsular cataract. No study discontinuations were attributed to adverse events. 
 As of August 2018, of the 29 patients who reported PRN1371-related TEAEs, the majority of these patients reported TEAEs that were classified as either mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2), and less than 22% of these patients reported PRN1371-related TEAEs that were severe (Grade 3: hyperphosphatemia (n=3), nausea (n=2), vomiting (n=1), hyponatremia (n=1), and one patient with both cataract and retinopathy (n=1), with none classified as life-threatening (Grade 4) or leading to death. TEAEs related to PRN1371 by maximum dose level are summarized in the table below.

Oral Immunoproteasome Inhibitor Program
 We believe selective blockade of protein degradation in immune cells by inhibiting the immunoproteasome has potential for the treatment of immunological diseases. We are applying our Tailored Covalency approach to purpose-design highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitors of the immunoproteasome, which exists only in immune cells. By selectively blocking unique targets in the immunoproteasome, our molecules are designed to alter undesired immune responses including pro-inflammatory cytokine production, aberrant T cell function and effects on antigen presentation. 
 We have discovered multiple series of highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. Selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome have demonstrated activity in preclinical autoimmune and inflammatory studies. These inhibitors are better tolerated than other proteasome and immunoproteasome inhibitors, in part because they spare the constitutive proteasome. Therefore, our inhibitors have potential utility in multiple autoimmune diseases.
 23

In June 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop therapies to bring the power of oral proteasome inhibition safely into the field of immunology for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Under this collaboration agreement, we received a $15.0 million upfront payment in June 2017.  In March 2019, we announced a mutual agreement with AbbVie to end our collaboration and to reacquire rights to the program following an assessment by AbbVie that there is no longer a strategic fit of our highly selective oral immunoproteasome inhibitors’ biologic profiles relative to AbbVie’s desired disease areas of focus.  We and AbbVie have agreed to conclude the collaboration effective March 2019. There are no further financial obligations between AbbVie and us.

We choose intellectual property protection that would provide the most robust protection for the asset that is being protected. For example, since patents provide the strongest form of intellectual protection for marketed drugs, we file for patent protection for our clinical candidates. During the discovery phase of our drug candidates, we pursue patent protection for composition of matter, including drug product, method of use, process of manufacture, and key intermediates. During the development phase of our drug candidates we continue to file patent applications as new inventions are made such as polymorphic forms, formulations, commercial processes, and new uses to increase our commercial success. Since patent protection is a territorial right, we file for patent protection for our drug candidates in at least major pharmaceutical markets such as the United States, Canada, Japan, European Union, Eurasia, China, South Korea, Australia and Mexico. As of December 2018, we had over 20 issued U.S. patents and over 20 patents issued outside of the United States.
 Occasionally, it may be necessary or useful for the conduct of our business to obtain rights to third-party intellectual property. We usually obtain rights to third-party intellectual property through exclusive or non-exclusive license or through assignment. For example, we have obtained exclusive licenses under the UC Agreements, to patents and patent applications covering our platform technologies under which we can make, have make, use, have use, sell, have sell, import, or have import products covered by these applications, including five licensed patents as of June 2018. Issued patents and any patents issuing from these applications in United States and abroad would expire between 2024 and 2033 without any potential patent term extensions. However, if we are not able to obtain rights to third-party intellectual property necessary or useful to our business on reasonable commercial terms, our business could be materially harmed.
 Patent Term Extension and Patent Term Adjustment
 The term of a patent in most countries, including the United States, is 20 years from the effective filing date of the patent assuming maintenance fees are paid, the patent has not been terminally disclaimed, and the patent has not been invalidated through administrative and/or court proceedings. For pharmaceutical products, however, the patent term covering the approved product, can be extended beyond the 20-year term if certain statutory and regulatory requirements are satisfied. In the United States one way the patent term of a patent covering the approved pharmaceutical product can be extended is under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension, or PTE, of up to five years, but not to exceed fourteen years of patent term, for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. In the future, if and when our drug candidates are approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we will apply for patent term extensions on patents covering the approved products if the patents are eligible for such extension.
 In addition, in the United States a patent term may be extended by patent term adjustment or PTA, which compensates a patent for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent unless the patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. PTE and PTA extensions are not mutually exclusive; however, extension under the PTA does not have any extension limits. We cannot however provide any assurance that any of our present or future patents will be eligible for patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
 The patent portfolio for our platform technologies and most advanced programs is summarized below.
 24

Tailored Covalency Platform Technologies
 The patent portfolio for the Tailored Covalency platform technologies includes both our own issued and pending patents and a series of issued patents and patent applications licensed exclusively to us as part of our license agreements with the Regents of the University of California. Issued patents and patents issuing from the applications will expire between 2024 and 2038 without any potential patent term extensions.
 PRN1008
 PRN1008 is a reversible covalent inhibitor of BTK and is based on our proprietary Tailored Covalency platform. The patent portfolio for PRN1008 includes issued patents and patent applications wholly owned by us and a patent/patent application as part of the UC Agreements. The wholly owned patent portfolio includes issued patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, methods of making, method of use, intermediates, and pharmaceutical compositions for site specific delivery. The issued composition of matter patents covering PRN1008 in United States and abroad will expire in 2033 without any potential patent term extensions. Additional patents and patents issuing from pending patent applications expire between 2032 and 2037 without any potential patent term extensions.
 PRN2246/SAR442168
 PRN2246/SAR442168 is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of BTK and is purpose-designed to cross the blood-brain barrier to enable treatment of inflammatory diseases within the CNS. The patent portfolio for PRN2246/SAR442168 includes issued patents and patent applications wholly owned by us. The wholly owned patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, method of use and pharmaceutical compositions for site specific delivery of PRN2246/SAR442168. The issued composition of matter patent covering PRN2246/SAR442168 in the United States and abroad will expire in 2036 without any potential patent term extensions.
 PRN1371
 PRN1371 is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of FGFR. The patent portfolio for PRN1371 includes issued patents and patent applications wholly owned by us and covers composition of matter, methods of making, method of use, intermediates, and pharmaceutical compositions. The issued composition of matter patent covering PRN1371 in the United States and abroad will expire in 2035 without any potential patent term extensions.
 Immunoproteasome Inhibitor
 We are designing oral inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. These inhibitors reduce production of a number of cytokines for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. The patent applications cover composition of matter (including compounds and pharmaceutical compositions) as well as methods of use. One application will expire in 2035, and the others will expire in 2038 without any potential patent term extensions.
 Our ability to protect and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates and platform technologies depends on breadth of claims in issued patents in the United States and abroad and our ability to enforce them. Since the patent prosecution process is an unpredictable process, there are no assurances that patent applications we have filed or licensed from third parties will result in the issuance of patents. In addition, we cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed and whether they would be enforceable. In addition, if there are any third party dominating patent(s) that cover our drug candidates, it will impact our ability to commercialize our drug candidates until we obtain a license to such patent(s). If we are unsuccessful in obtaining a license to the patent on reasonable terms or the patentee is unwilling to give us a license, we may have to bring administrative proceedings such as inter party review, post grant proceeding, opposition proceedings to cancel the blocking patent claims, or invalidation proceeding in a court of law. This could result in substantial costs to us or delay in commercialization of our drug candidates even if we are successful. Additionally, since the drug development and regulatory review process is lengthy and unpredictable, it is possible that patents covering such drug candidates may expire prior to commercialization or remain in force for a short duration following commercialization thereby reducing our marketing exclusivity which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 25

For the conduct of our research and development activities we may use services of third parties such as contractors, scientific advisors, and consultants and may have to disclose our proprietary information to such third parties. We protect our intellectual property in these situations by entering into service or consulting agreements with such third parties under which they are obligated to assign any invention arising from the services to us, maintain our proprietary information confidential, and not use confidential information of others. These agreements may however be breached by the above parties and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, to the extent, that the above parties utilize intellectual property of others in their work for us without our knowledge, disputes may arise as to the ownership of resulting invention and know-how which may adversely impact our business.
 In addition to patent protection, we utilize trade secrets to protect proprietary information related to our research tools, know how, continuing technological innovation relating to our platform technologies and to help maintain our competitive advantage. We own two registered trademarks for “Principia Biopharma” and “Tailored Covalency.” We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, scientific advisors, and consultants to protect our proprietary information. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect, and we anticipate that with respect to our platform technologies, these trade secrets and know-how may over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development.
 Our Licenses and Collaborations
 Sanofi License Agreement related to PRN2246/SAR442168
 In November 2017, we entered into the Sanofi Agreement for an exclusive license to PRN2246/SAR442168 and backup molecules for development in MS and potentially other CNS diseases. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we will complete Phase 1, and Sanofi will take on all further development activities. We and Sanofi were each responsible for certain early development costs, and Sanofi will be responsible for all further development and commercialization costs, subject to our Phase 3 option described below.
 Sanofi has an exclusive license for PRN2246/SAR442168 and its backups for the CNS field, which includes indications of the central nervous system, retina and ophthalmic nerve. We have agreed not to develop other BTK inhibitors within the CNS field, and Sanofi has agreed not to develop PRN2246/SAR442168 or its backups for any indications outside the CNS field. In the event that we cease all development and commercialization of our other BTK inhibitors or unilaterally decide to offer Sanofi a field expansion, Sanofi could expand its field upon payment to us of a field expansion payment as well as potential milestones and royalties as related to the expanded field.
 In December 2017, we received a $40.0 million upfront payment. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we may receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to an aggregate of $765.0 million, as well as tiered royalties up to the mid-teens. We have an option to fund a portion of Phase 3 development costs in return for, at our option, either a profit and loss sharing arrangement within the United States, or an additional worldwide royalty that would result in tiered royalties up to the high-teens. Only the additional royalty option would be available if we develop PRN1008 for major enumerated indications overseen by the FDA’s Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products or in the event of a certain change of control involving us and certain Sanofi competitors. Royalties are subject to specified reductions and are payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the date that all of our patent rights that claim a composition of matter of such product expire in such country, the date of expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or the date that is ten years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 In May 2018, we amended the Sanofi Agreement to include additional activities under the early development plan and to modify the definition of one of the milestone payments. In 2018, we received a total of $25.0 million for the achievement of multiple early development milestones. 
 The Sanofi Agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of all royalty payment obligations for all products in such country, except in the case of the United States, if we elect to fund a portion of Phase 3 development costs and share in profits and losses in the United States. Either party may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or a bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. Subject to certain exceptions, we may terminate the Sanofi Agreement with respect to specific patents licensed under the agreement in the event that Sanofi challenges the validity, enforceability or patentability of such patents. Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement either in its entirety or on a regional basis upon prior written notice to us, including a shorter notice period in the event of a safety concern or failure of the product to successfully complete certain early-stage development studies. Upon any termination, all licenses granted to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement terminate.
 26

Sanofi has the right to terminate the Sanofi Agreement upon prior written notice to us in the event of our change of control. Additionally, if the agreement is not terminated in the event of any such change of control as a result of an acquisition of our business by certain competitors of Sanofi, our right to receive a share in profits and losses in the United States will cease, and we will only have the right to receive increased tiered royalties up to the high-teens in the event we exercise our option to fund a portion of Phase 3 development costs.
 AbbVie Development and License Agreement related to Oral Immunoproteasome Inhibitors
 In June 2017, we entered into the AbbVie Agreement related to the research and development of oral immunoproteasome inhibitors and received an upfront payment of $15.0 million. In March 2019, we announced a mutual agreement with AbbVie to end our collaboration and to reacquire rights to the program, following an assessment by AbbVie that there is no longer a strategic fit of our highly selective oral immunoproteasome inhibitors’ biologic profiles relative to AbbVie’s desired disease areas of focus. We and AbbVie have agreed to conclude the collaboration effective March 2019 and there are no further financial obligations between AbbVie and us.
 University of California License Agreements
 In November 2009, we entered into a license agreement, or the First Agreement, with the Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, which was amended in October 2010, February 2011, and amended and restated in May 2012. In September 2011, we entered into a separate license agreement, or the Second Agreement, with Regents which was amended and restated in December 2013. We refer to the First Agreement and the Second Agreement together as the UC Agreements. Under the UC Agreements, the Regents have granted to us exclusive, worldwide licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents’ patent rights in certain patent applications to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and services and practice methods covered by such patent applications in all fields of use.
 We have paid the Regents license fees of $30,000 and $10,000 under the First Agreement and the Second Agreement, respectively, and we are required to pay the Regents annual license maintenance fees equal to $30,000 and $10,000 for the First Agreement and Second Agreement, respectively, prior to launching any licensed product. We may be obligated to make one-time regulatory and development milestone payments under the First Agreement or the Second Agreement for future drug candidates. We are obligated to pay the Regents tiered royalty payments in the low single digits on net sales of the licensed products. The royalty is payable under the First Agreement or the Second Agreement, but not both. For licensed products under the First Agreement, we have to pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product occurs. The royalties are subject to standard reductions and are payable until the patents upon which such royalties are based expire or are held invalid. The patents issuing under the First Agreement will expire between 2024 and 2030 and under the Second Agreement will expire in 2033, subject to any potential patent term extensions. Additionally, we are obligated to pay the Regents payments on non-royalty licensing revenue we receive from our sub-licensees for products covered by UC patents that were identified and developed by us or any third parties. The UC Agreements require us to make IPO milestone payments under each of the First Agreement and Second Agreement upon the closing of an IPO. Pursuant to the UC agreements, we made IPO milestone payments totaling approximately $140,000 to the Regents in early October 2018.
 Under the UC Agreements, we are required to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture, regulatory approval, and sale of licensed products which include obligations to meet certain development-stage milestones within specified periods of time and to market the resulting licensed products in sufficient quantity to meet market demand. We have the right and option to extend the date by which we must meet any milestone in one year extensions by paying an extension fee for second and subsequent extensions, provided we can demonstrate we made diligent efforts to meet the milestone.
 These UC Agreements with the Regents continue until the expiration or abandonment of the last of the patent rights licensed under the applicable First or the Second Agreement unless terminated by operation of law. We may terminate the license under the Agreements wholly or on a country-by-country basis without cause at any time by giving prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate one or both of the Agreements for an uncured breach by us of a material term of the Agreement(s) in question.

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We are aware of several other drug candidates in earlier stages of development as potential treatments for the indications that we intend to target. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or with a more favorable label than PRN1008, PRN2246/SAR442168, PRN1371 or any other drug candidate that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their drug candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 BTK Inhibitors
 There are a number of BTK inhibitors in development. These competitive BTK inhibitors span across multiple indications that may or may not be targeted with our BTK inhibitor franchise. We are aware of many different companies including pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies that are developing BTK inhibitors for autoimmune diseases, including AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Genentech, Gilead, Innocare, Merck KGaA, and Taiho. Certain of these are at a similar stage of development as PRN1008. We are aware of one other company, Merck KGaA, developing a BTK inhibitor for MS.
 Pemphigus
 Only one drug, rituximab, has been approved for the treatment of PV in the United States. In Europe, CS and azathioprine are the only approved therapies for the treatment of pemphigus. Other treatments commonly used for pemphigus include various other immunosuppressants and IVIg. We are also aware of FcRn-targeted molecules being developed for the treatment of pemphigus.
ITP
 Steroids and IVIg are commonly used as first-line treatment for the treatment of ITP. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as romiplostim and eltombopag, the off-label use of anti-CD20 rituximab, as well as the recently approved Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, are used as second-line or third-line treatment for the disease. FcRn-targeted molecules are currently in development for ITP.
MS
 Current treatments primarily target cytokine behavior; suppress T cell activation, proliferation, migration and CNS infiltration; and inhibit B cell activity. These therapies have demonstrated efficacy predominantly in patients whose disease is characterized by an active inflammatory component—mainly RRMS or SPMS—but have proven less effective in patients with PPMS. Optimal management of MS should target inflammation on both sides of the blood-brain barrier.
 28

FGFR Inhibitors
 Small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of the FGFRs, as well as monoclonal antibodies to FGFR isoforms, are being developed by a number of pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies. Many of the first generation development compounds were less selective, inhibiting many related receptor tyrosine kinases such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, confounding the interpretation of the clinical data as well as the observed toxicity. We are aware of a number of companies that are developing more selective compounds with clinical activity seen in lung cancer, bile duct cancer and bladder cancer.
 Commercialization Plans
 Our aim is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. Doing so will enable us to pursue our mission to significantly improve the lives of patients suffering from autoimmune disease and cancer. At this stage of the company, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. Our initial focus for our wholly owned drug candidates is to develop them in orphan indications and genetically defined patient populations allowing us to efficiently commercialize our drug candidates in the United States on our own and potentially worldwide in the longer term. We, however, may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their capabilities to maximize the potential of our drug candidates. For our program addressing larger patient populations, we have entered into a collaboration with Sanofi and they are responsible for commercialization of PRN2246/SAR442168. We believe this approach will allow us to successfully commercialize our wholly owned candidates while relying on our partner for more resource intensive programs.
Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, for PRN1008, PRN2246/SAR442168 and PRN1371 for our preclinical and planned clinical phase testing from different third-party API manufacturers and bulk drug product from other third-party manufacturers. We obtain our preclinical and clinical supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and currently do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We are in the process of implementing a redundant supply chain for PRN1008 API and drug product. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify redundant manufacturers, with long-term agreements in place, to provide the API and drug product prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA and/or a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency. PRN1008, PRN2246/SAR442168 and PRN1371 are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review, and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to 
 29

comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Any of our future drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through an NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical Studies and IND
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical 
 30

data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 31

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our drug candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 NDA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for drug candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the drug candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.

The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a 
 33

major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.
 In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product or where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following approval for the approved therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In the European Union, a marketing authorization for an orphan designated product will not be granted if a similar drug has been approved in the European Union for the same therapeutic indication, unless the applicant can establish that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. A similar drug is a product containing a similar active substance or substances as those contained in an already authorized product. Similar active substance is defined as an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same molecular features) and which acts via the same mechanism.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences, and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or supplemental NDA, or sNDA, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
 Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 34

 
• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 Research and development activities prior to product approval and manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, prescription drug manufacturers must comply with federal fraud and abuse, data privacy, transparency, and other healthcare laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower and qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses.
 Federal civil and criminal statutes prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Payments made to institutions, physicians and other healthcare providers are subject to federal and state regulations, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act. The Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 35

Personally identifiable information, under certain conditions, is also subject to data privacy and security regulation by both federal and state governments. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and business associates that perform services for covered entities that involve individually identifiable health information.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 Many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies, pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals and track and report gifts and other payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers, and certain state and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject a pharmaceutical manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted 
 36

or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a National Drug Rebate Agreement, or NDRA, with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. On March 23, 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, finalized updates to the NDRA, or the Updated NDRA, for the first time in 27 years, to incorporate a number legislative and regulatory changes, including changes to align with certain provisions of the ACA. As of October 1, 2018, in order to have any approved products covered by Medicaid and, if applicable, Medicare Part B, we will be required to enter into the Updated NDRA.
 The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States. For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
 37

As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 The ACA is one example of such federal legislation and has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration, to repeal, replace, delay or circumvent certain aspects of the ACA. Although comprehensive repeal legislation has not been passed, legislation affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA, as well as efforts to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” have been passed. Congress may still consider additional legislation to repeal, or repeal and replace, other elements of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 In addition to the changes brought about by the ACA, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers 
 38

working with these organizations. Although a number of these, and other, proposals may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (“Right to Try Act”) was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
