Item 1. Business
Background
As a leading provider of comprehensive hydrogen fuel cell turnkey solutions, Plug Power is driving the hydrogen economy. The Company is focused on green hydrogen (hydrogen fuel produced using renewable resources and electrolysis) and fuel cell solutions used to power electric motors primarily in the electric mobility and stationary power markets, responding to the ongoing paradigm shift in the power, energy, and transportation industries to address climate change and energy security and to meet sustainability goals. Plug Power created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell. The Company has deployed over 40,000 fuel cell systems and accelerated its vertical integration through acquisitions, making it a global leader in green hydrogen solutions.
We are focused on proton exchange membrane (“PEM”), fuel cell and fuel processing technologies, fuel cell/battery hybrid technologies, and associated hydrogen and green hydrogen generation, storage and dispensing infrastructure. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and heat without combustion.
Plug Power delivers end-to-end clean hydrogen and zero-emissions fuel cell solutions for supply chain and logistics applications, on-road electric vehicles, the stationary power market, and more. Our largest market today is material handling; we support customers at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits. In June 2020, Plug Power completed the acquisitions of United Hydrogen Group Inc. (“UHG”) and Giner ELX, Inc. (“Giner ELX”), in line with the Company’s vertical integration strategy. These acquisitions further enhance Plug Power’s position in the hydrogen industry, with capabilities in generation, liquefaction and distribution of hydrogen

The specific elements of the orders will vary in terms of timing of delivery and can vary between 90 days to 10 years, with fuel cells and hydrogen installations being delivered near term and maintenance services and hydrogen fuel deliveries being delivered over a longer period of time. Historically, shipments made against product orders have generally occurred between ninety days and twenty-four months from the date of acceptance of the order.
On December 31, 2020, the Company waived the remaining vesting conditions under the warrant that was issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (“Amazon”), in April 2017 (the “Amazon Warrant”), which resulted in a reduction to revenue of $399.7 million, resulting in negative consolidated revenue of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 18, “Warrant Transaction Agreements” to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Total revenue in 2020 for this customer was negative $310.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this customer accounted for (332.4)% of our total consolidated revenues which included a provision for warrant charge of $420.0 million, which was recorded as a reduction of revenue. Additionally, 156.2% of our total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with two other customers. For the years ended 2019 and 2018, 49.7% and 66.8%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with two customers. For purposes of assigning a customer to a sale/leaseback transaction completed with a financial institution, the Company considers the end user of the assets to be the ultimate customer. A loss or decline in business with any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We assemble our products at our manufacturing facilities in Latham, New York, Rochester, New York and Spokane, Washington, and provide our services and installations at customer locations and service centers in Romeoville, Illinois and Dayton, Ohio.

Working Capital Items
We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production. We consider the component parts of our different products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs.
Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships
We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including distribution, service, marketing, supply, technology development and product development. We sell our products worldwide, with a 

12



primary focus on North America, Europe, and Asia, through our direct product sales force, OEMs, and their dealer networks. We operate in Europe under the name HyPulsion, to develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell systems for the European material handling market.
Environmental Issues
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state, or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material.
We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Competition
We experience competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for motive and backup power are characterized by the presence of well-established battery and combustion generator products. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including size and weight, relative price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and reliability, safety, ease of use, rapid integration with existing equipment and processes, customer support design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
Intellectual Property
We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems. However, we believe the design and integration of our system and system components, as well as some of the low-cost manufacturing processes that we have developed, are intellectual property that can be protected. Our intellectual property portfolio covers, among other things: fuel cell components that reduce manufacturing part count; fuel cell system designs that lend themselves to mass manufacturing; improvements to fuel cell system efficiency, reliability and system life; and control strategies, such as added safety protections and operation under extreme conditions. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether patented or not, made or conceived while being our employee, which are related to or result from work or research that we perform, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
We have a total of 120 issued patents currently active with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and at the close of 2020, we had six U.S. patent applications pending. Additionally, we have 20 trademarks registered with the USPTO and two trademark applications pending.
Government Regulation
Our products, their installations and the operations at our facilities are subject to oversight and regulation at the federal, state and local level in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located.
In addition, product safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), covering the overall fuel cell system. The class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of UL 2267 “Fuel Cell Power Systems for Installation in Industrial Electric Trucks” and NFPA 505 “Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks.” The hydrogen tanks used in these systems have been either certified to ANSI/CSA NGV2-2007 “Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Containers” or ISO/TS 15869 “Gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen blends—Land vehicle fuel tanks.” We will continue to design our GenDrive products to meet ANSI and/or other applicable standards. We certified several models of Class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products to the 

13



requirements of the CE mark with guidance from a European certified body. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems are certified to the Pressure Equipment Directive by a European certified body.
The GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of NFPA 2 “Hydrogen Technologies Code.”
Other than these requirements, at this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, each jurisdiction will impose on our products or their installation. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install and service our products. As we continue distributing our systems to our target markets, the federal, state, local or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts.
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources. We believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. We are mitigating these potential risks by introducing alternate system architectures which we expect will allow us to diversify our supply chain with multiple fuel cell stack and air supply component vendors. We are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key raw materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials or components.
Research and Development
Because the fuel cell industry is still in the early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of cost, size, weight, and in supporting service solutions in order to drive further commercialization.
We reviewed the composition of our research and development expenses and corrected errors in the presentation of these expenses (See Note 2, “Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements” and Note 3, “Unaudited Quarterly Financial data and Restatement of Previously Issued Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements”). We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Our research and development expense totaled $27.8 million, $15.1 million, and $12.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as restated. We also had cost of research and development contract revenue of $0, $0.2 million, and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as restated. These expenses represent the cost of research and development programs that are partially funded under cost reimbursement research and development arrangements with third parties and are reported within other cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,285 employees, with 1,253 located in the United States and 32 located outside of the United States, as well as 300 temporary employees. In order to facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Plug Power a safe, rewarding, and challenging workplace with competitive salaries.
Our employees are critical to the Company’s growth, expansion and success, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. The Company is dedicated to fostering a culture of diversity and committed to hiring talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives to which the Company’s ultimate success is linked.
