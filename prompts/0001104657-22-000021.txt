Ore reserve data can be found in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The availability of these raw materials, as well as other materials used by us, is adequate and generally not dependent on any one supplier.
Patents and Licenses
We own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. While our rights under these patents and licenses are of some importance to our operations, our business is not materially dependent on any one patent or license or on all of our patents and licenses as a group.
Backlog
The backlog of unshipped orders as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $481.5 million, $279.2 million, and $176.4 million, respectively. Backlog is generally represented by purchase orders that may be terminated under certain conditions. We expect that substantially all of our backlog of orders at December 31, 2021 will be filled over the next 18 months.
Acquisitions
On November 1, 2021, the Company acquired HCS-Electronic Materials for a purchase price of approximately $395.9 million in cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment mechanism. This business operates within the Performance Alloys and Composites and Advanced Materials segments, and the results of operations are included as of the date of acquisition. Refer to Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the acquisition of HCS-Electronic Materials.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the manufacturing, processing, use, handling, storage, transport, treatment, emission, release, and disposal of substances and wastes used or generated in manufacturing. For decades, we have operated our 
facilities under applicable standards of inplant and outplant emissions and releases. The inhalation of airborne beryllium particulate may present a health hazard to certain individuals.
On January 9, 2017, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and record-keeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. On July 6, 2018, OSHA issued a Direct Final Rule that amended the text of the new standard to clarify OSHA’s intent with respect to certain terms and provisions of the standard, and on December 11, 2018, OSHA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning additional modifications to the standard “to clarify certain provisions and to simplify or improve compliance.” OSHA issued the final beryllium standard incorporating these additional modifications on July 14, 2020. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions of the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.
In addition to laws that regulate the manufacturing, processing, use, handling, storage, transport, treatment, emission, release, and disposal of substances and wastes used or generated in manufacturing, we are subject to various laws around the world. For example, trade regulations, including tariffs or other import or export restrictions, may increase the cost of some of our raw materials or cross-border shipments, and limit our ability to do business in certain countries or with certain individuals. We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. With respect to the laws and regulations noted above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, the Company's compliance programs may, under certain circumstances, involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology, and capital. 
Human Capital Management
Materion employees are located throughout the world. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. We employed approximately 3,443 people globally as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 575 were in the Asia–Pacific region, 472 were in the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, and 2,396 were in the North America region. Among our total global employee population, approximately 2,183 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to customer service excellence and uncompromising values, provides the foundation for our Company’s success. 
Our employees are responsible for upholding our core values, which include working safely and collaboratively, conducting all aspects of business with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, leveraging processes and data to drive continuous improvement, empowering individuals and teams, embracing change, attracting and developing diverse global talent, and partnering for the betterment of the communities where we live and operate.

On an annual basis, our corporate long-range strategies are reviewed and updated, improvement plans are developed for each global location, progress is tracked, and daily critical safety statistics and metrics are published internally. Our corporate intranet site is visible to all global employees, where we share detailed descriptions of serious injuries and near misses and their corrective actions, as well as other proactive measures to promote lessons learned and ensure worker safety. Safety awareness and employee engagement programs have been implemented at all global facilities. We also have onsite medical teams at two key manufacturing sites to provide medical testing for employees to determine any potential exposure to beryllium, of which Materion is a leading global supplier. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so our employees can more safely and effectively perform their work. Our health and safety focus is evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe, which has included the following:
•adding work from home flexibility; 
•encouraging those who are sick to stay home; 
•increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; 
•initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures; 
•providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies; 
•modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers and touchless faucets;

•giving financial incentives for employees to become vaccinated, including booster shots; and 
•requiring masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law.
We manufacture products which are deemed essential to critical infrastructure and all production sites have continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we have invested in creating physically safe work environments for our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
As part of our human capital management initiatives to attract, develop, and retain diverse global talent, we track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, and diversity hiring analytics. This data-driven approach helps ensure that we stay aligned to our goal of creating a positive and dynamic global work environment where all employees can flourish. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. To attract a global workforce, we strive to create and embed a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work. 
Our employee resource groups (ERGs) are Company-sponsored groups of global employees that support and promote the specific mutual objectives of both the employees and the Company, with emphasis on the inclusion, diversity, and professional development of employees. The ERGs provide opportunities for employees to connect, develop, and grow together in a supportive environment. As of December 31, 2021, we had four ERGs: ELEVATE (Women); V.E.T. (veterans and allies of the military); LGBTQ+; and United Voices of Materion (all ethnic backgrounds). Our focus continues to be on the recruitment of diverse candidates as well as the development of our internal cadres of diverse leaders so that they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions throughout the Company. Additionally, in 2020, we launched professional development training for our female leaders in partnership with the PRADCO organization. We plan to offer professional development training again in 2022 with a new cohort of female leaders. 
Talent Development
We continue to prioritize professional development and training for all global employees. By providing employees with wide-ranging development programs, opportunities, and paths to success, we empower them to realize their full potential. We strongly encourage employees to create a career development plan with focused milestones and ongoing two-way communication with their managers and supervisors. Apprenticeship programs have been implemented in some of our large plant sites, and we continue to introduce similar programs throughout the Company. 
We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of leaders. Our robust and fully integrated talent and succession-planning process supports the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in operations management, commercial excellence and finance. On an annual basis, we conduct organizational reviews with our Chief Executive Officer and all business unit and function senior leaders to identify and evaluate our high potential, diverse talent and succession plans for our most critical roles.
