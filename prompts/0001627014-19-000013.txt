Our business is organized into two segments:
Software Solutions – offers software and hosting solutions that support loan servicing, loan origination and settlement services. 
Data and Analytics – offers data and analytics solutions to the mortgage, real estate and capital markets verticals. These solutions include property ownership data, lien data, servicing data, automated valuation models, collateral risk scores, prepayment and default models, lead generation, multiple listing service solutions and other data solutions.
We offer our solutions to a wide range of clients across the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. The quality and breadth of our solutions contribute to the long-standing nature of our relationships with our clients, the majority of whom enter into long-term contracts across multiple products that are embedded in their mission critical workflow and decision processes, particularly in the Software Solutions segment. Given the contractual nature of our revenues and stickiness of our client relationships, our revenues are highly visible and recurring in nature. Due to our integrated suite of solutions and our scale, we are able to drive significant operating leverage, which we believe enables our clients to operate more efficiently while allowing us to generate strong margins and cash flows.

Our Markets
The U.S. mortgage market is large, and the loan lifecycle is complex and consists of several stages. The mortgage loan lifecycle includes origination, servicing and default. Mortgages are originated to finance home purchases or refinance existing mortgages. Once a mortgage is originated, it is serviced on a periodic basis by mortgage servicers, which may not be the lenders that originated the mortgage. Furthermore, if a mortgage experiences default, it triggers a set of multifaceted processes with an assortment of potential outcomes depending on a mix of variables.
Underlying the three major components of the mortgage loan lifecycle are the software, data and analytics support behind each process, which has become critical to industry participants due to the complexity of regulatory requirements. As the industry has grown in complexity, participants have responded by outsourcing to large scale specialty providers, automating manual processes and seeking end-to-end solutions that support the processes required to manage the entire mortgage loan lifecycle.
Overview of the Markets We Serve
The U.S. mortgage servicing market is comprised of first and second lien mortgage loans. Even through housing downturns, the mortgage servicing market generally remains stable, as the total number of first lien mortgage loans outstanding tends to stay relatively constant. The number of second lien mortgage loans outstanding can vary based on a number of factors including loan-to-value ratios, interest rates and lenders' desire to own such loans.
While delinquent mortgages typically represent a small portion of the overall loan servicing market, the mortgage default process is long and complex and involves multiple parties, a significant exchange of data and documentation and extensive regulatory requirements. Providers in the default process must be able to meet strict regulatory guidelines, which we believe are best met through the use of technology.
The U.S. mortgage origination market consists of both purchase and refinance originations. The mortgage origination process is complex and involves multiple parties, significant data exchange and significant regulatory oversight, which requires a comprehensive, scalable solution developed by a company with substantial industry experience. According to the MBA, the U.S. mortgage origination market for purchase and refinance originations is estimated as follows (in billions):

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Mortgage Originations (1): | | | | | 
Purchase | $ | 1,185.0 | | | $ | 1,143.0 | | $ | 1,052.0
Refinance | 458.0 | | | 616.0 | | | 999.0
Total | $ | 1,643.0 | | | $ | 1,760.0 | | $ | 2,051.0

Market Trends
Market trends that have spurred lenders and servicers to seek software solutions are as follows:
Growing role of technology in the U.S. mortgage industry. Banks and other lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on automation and workflow management to operate more efficiently and meet their regulatory requirements. We believe technology providers must be able to support the complexity of the market, display extensive industry knowledge and possess the financial resources to make the necessary investments in technology to support lenders. This includes an enhanced digital experience along with the application of artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and adaptive learning.
Lenders increasingly focused on core operations. As a result of regulatory scrutiny and the higher cost of doing business, we believe lenders have become more focused on their core operations and customers. We believe lenders are increasingly shifting from in-house solutions to third-party solutions that provide a more comprehensive and efficient solution. Lenders require these providers to deliver best-in-class solutions and deep domain expertise and to assist them in maintaining regulatory compliance.
Increased demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight. As U.S. mortgage market participants work to minimize the risk in lending, servicing and capital markets, they rely on the integration of data and analytics with solutions that enhance the decision-making process. These industry participants rely on large comprehensive third-party databases coupled with enhanced analytics to achieve these goals.
Regulatory oversight. Most U.S. mortgage market participants are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight and regulatory requirements as federal and state governments have enacted various new laws, rules and regulations. One example of such legislation is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), which contained broad changes for many sectors of the financial services and lending industries and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), the federal regulatory agency responsible for regulating consumer financial protection within the United States. It is our experience that mortgage lenders have become more focused on minimizing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and are 
3

looking toward solutions that assist them in complying with their regulatory requirements. In addition, recent high-profile data security incidents have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our clients and our clients' regulators. We expect the industry focus on privacy and data security to continue to increase.
Our Solutions and Services
Our solutions provide clients with a comprehensive, integrated software and workflow management solution set that is supported by data and analytics to enhance capabilities and drive efficiencies while assisting our clients with regulatory compliance.
Software Solutions
Our Software Solutions segment offers leading software and hosting solutions that facilitate and automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the homeownership lifecycle. These solutions primarily consist of mortgage origination and servicing, processing and workflow management software applications coupled with related support and services.
Our clients in this segment are primarily mortgage lenders and servicers. We believe they use our software and services to reduce their operating costs, improve their ability to provide superior customer service and enhance the quality and consistency of various aspects of their mortgage operations. We work with our clients to enhance and integrate our software and services in order to assist them in gaining the greatest value from the solutions we provide.

This scalable solution helps deliver operational efficiencies to reduce turn times and origination costs by automating many of the task-oriented and repetitive manual functions that lenders manage every day and accelerating the speed of processing.

Data and Analytics
Our Data and Analytics segment supports and enhances our software solutions and is designed to help lenders and servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. We believe, based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, that we have aggregated one of the largest residential real estate data sets in the United States that is derived from both proprietary and public data sources. Utilizing this data, subject to any applicable use restrictions, and our deep history and understanding of the mortgage market, we have created detailed real estate data solutions that assist in portfolio management, valuations, property records, lead generation and improved risk analysis for all aspects of origination, servicing, default and capital markets/investing. In addition, we deliver data, analytics and software solutions to customers in the real estate, title insurance, multiple listing service ("MLS") and other verticals that rely on property data-centric solutions to make informed decisions and run their businesses.
Our primary data and analytics services are as follows:

• | Property data: A large collection of property information on real estate parcels in the United States. The data is delivered through a variety of distribution mechanisms, including web portals, application programming interfaces, bulk files and through integrations with our proprietary mortgage enterprise software platforms.

We also recently introduced to the market our Actionable Intelligence Platform ("AIPSM"), a unified framework for delivering actionable intelligence across the loan lifecycle. AIP supports origination, servicing and home equity businesses and is designed to address our clients' revenue, efficiency and compliance initiatives.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Market leadership with comprehensive and integrated solutions. We are a leading provider of comprehensive and integrated solutions. We believe our leadership position is, in part, the result of our unique expertise and insight developed from over 55 years serving the needs of clients in the mortgage industry. We have used this insight to develop an integrated and comprehensive suite of proprietary software, data and analytics solutions to automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the entire homeownership lifecycle. These integrated solutions are designed to reduce manual processes, assist in improving organizational compliance and mitigating risk, and to ultimately deliver significant cost savings to our clients.


• | Broad and deep client relationships with significant recurring revenues. We have long-standing, sticky relationships with our largest clients. We frequently enter into long-term contracts with our software solutions clients that contain a base fee that is contractually obligated. Our products are typically embedded within our clients' mission-critical workflow and decision-making processes across various parts of their organizations.


• | Extensive data assets and analytics capabilities. We develop and maintain large, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the mortgage and housing industry that we believe are competitively differentiated. Our unique data sets provide a combination of public and proprietary data, and each of our data records features a large number of attributes. Our data scientists utilize our data sets, subject to any applicable use restrictions, and comprehensive analytical capabilities to create highly customized reports, including models of customer behavior for originators and servicers, portfolio analytics for capital markets and government agencies and proprietary market insights for real estate agencies. Our

5

data and analytics capabilities are also embedded into our software solutions and workflow products, providing our clients with integrated and comprehensive solutions.

• | Scalable and cost-effective operating model. We believe we have a highly attractive and scalable operating model derived from our market leadership, hosted software solutions and the large number of clients we serve. Our scalable operating model provides us with significant benefits. Our scale and operating leverage allows us to add incremental clients to our existing platforms with limited incremental cost. As a result, our operating model drives attractive margins and generates significant cash flow. Also, by leveraging our scale and leading market position, we are able to make cost-effective investments in our software solutions to assist with complex regulatory and compliance requirements, which we believe increases our value proposition to clients.

Our Strategy
Our comprehensive and integrated software solutions, robust data and analytic capabilities, differentiated business model, broad and deep client relationships and other competitive strengths enable us to pursue multiple growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our business and grow through the following key strategies:

• | Cross-sell existing products. We believe our established client base presents a substantial opportunity for growth. We seek to capitalize on the trend of standardization and increased adoption of leading third-party solutions and increase the number of solutions provided to our existing client base. We intend to broaden and deepen our client relationships by cross-selling our suite of end-to-end software solutions, as well as our robust data and analytics. By helping our clients understand the full extent of our comprehensive solutions and the value of leveraging the multiple solutions we offer, we believe we can expand our existing relationships by allowing our clients to focus on their core businesses and their customers.


• | Win new clients. We intend to attract new clients by leveraging the value proposition provided by our software and comprehensive solutions offering. In particular, we believe there is a significant opportunity to penetrate the mid-tier mortgage originators and servicers market. We believe these institutions can benefit from our proven solutions suite in order to address complex regulatory requirements and compete more effectively in the evolving mortgage market. We intend to continue to pursue this channel and benefit from the low incremental cost of adding new customers to our scalable applications and infrastructure.


• | Solution development. Our long-term vision is to be the industry-leading provider for participants of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals for their platform, data and analytic needs. We intend to enhance what we believe is a leadership position by continuing to innovate our solutions and refine the insight we provide to our clients. We have a strong track record of introducing and developing new solutions that span the homeownership lifecycle, are tailored to specific industry trends and enhance our clients' core operating functions. By working in partnership with key clients, we have been able to develop and market new and advanced solutions to our client base that meet the evolving demands of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. In addition, we will continue to develop and leverage insights from our large public and proprietary data assets to further improve our customer value proposition.


• | Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. The core focus of our strategy is to grow organically. However, we may selectively evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that would allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base and deepen our product and service offerings. We believe that there are meaningful synergies that result from acquiring small companies that provide best-in-class single point solutions. Integrating and cross-selling these point solutions into our broader client base and integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating environment would potentially result in revenues and cost synergies.

Our Clients
We have numerous clients in each category of service that we offer. A significant focus of our marketing efforts is on the top U.S. mortgage originators and servicers. We also provide our solutions to a number of other financial institutions, investors, attorneys, trustees and real estate professionals.
The U.S. mortgage industry is concentrated among the top 25 mortgage institutions and our most significant and long-term relationships tend to follow the industry landscape. We typically provide an extensive number of solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenues from our largest clients.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, Wells Fargo, N.A. accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 13% of our Software Solutions segment revenues. We also had one client that accounted for approximately 14% of our Data and Analytics segment revenues.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 36% of our Software Solutions segment revenues. However, the revenues in each case are spread across a range of services and are subject to multiple, separate contracts. Although the diversity of the services we provide to each 
6

of these clients reduces the risk that we would lose all of the revenues associated with any of these clients, a significant deterioration in our relationships with or the loss of any one or more of these clients could have a significant effect on our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on both generating new clients as well as cross-selling our broad service offerings to existing clients.
We have teams of experienced sales personnel with subject matter expertise in particular services and in the needs of particular types of clients. A significant portion of our potential clients in each of our business lines is targeted via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound telemarketing efforts. Marketing activities include direct marketing, print and electronic advertising, media relations, web-based activities, thought leadership, client meetings and conferences, tradeshow and convention activities and other targeted initiatives.
Given the broad range of solutions we offer and the concentration and scale of many of our existing clients, we have the opportunity to expand our sales to our existing client base through cross-selling efforts. We have established a core team of account managers who cross-sell the full range of our services to existing and potential clients at the top U.S. mortgage originators and servicers, as well as a number of other financial institutions, investors and real estate professionals. The individuals who participate in this effort spend a significant amount of their time on sales and marketing efforts.
We engage in strategic account reviews, during which our executives share their knowledge of clients and the market in order to determine the best sales approach on a client-by-client basis. As a result, we believe we have created an effective cross-selling culture within our organization.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities relate primarily to the design, development and enhancement of our software applications. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our infrastructure. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices and copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our software, technology, data and expertise. Further, we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on the above to protect our rights in that area. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret and trademark rights.
Competition
A number of the businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Competitive factors in processing businesses include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. We believe that our integrated software solutions and economies of scale in the mortgage processing business provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we also believe that no single competitor offers the depth and breadth of solutions we are able to offer.
Software Solutions. With respect to our Software Solutions segment, we compete with our clients' internal technology departments and other providers of similar systems, such as Ellie Mae, Inc., Sagent Lending Technologies and Mortgage Cadence. Competitive factors include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. We believe that our integrated software solutions and economies of scale in the mortgage processing business provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories.
Data and Analytics. In our Data and Analytics segment, we primarily compete with CoreLogic, Inc., First American Financial Corporation, in-house capabilities and certain niche providers. We compete based on the breadth and depth of our data, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets and the capabilities to create highly customized reports. We believe that the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by the broad range of our data sources, including non-public sources, the volume of records we maintain, our ability to integrate our data and analytics with our software solutions and the ability to leverage our market leading position in the mortgage origination and servicing industries.

Government Regulation
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.
As a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.
Our financial institution clients are required to comply with various privacy laws and regulations under state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the same privacy regulations and are generally bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as those that apply to the financial institutions themselves.
The most recent financial crisis resulted in increased scrutiny of all parties involved in the mortgage industry by governmental authorities. This scrutiny has included federal and state governmental review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business, including an increased legislative and regulatory focus on consumer protection practices. Future legislative or regulatory changes are difficult to predict and new laws or regulations that may be implemented by the CFPB or other regulatory bodies may require us to change our business practices or cause us to incur increased costs to comply.
Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they have implemented or are seeking to implement further restrictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies ("NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation") and the Vermont Act Relating to Data Brokers and Consumer Protection ("Vermont Data Broker Law"), on the acquisition, dissemination or commercial use of personal information within the public and private sectors and are also contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. We are also subject to these state regulations.
Information Security
We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information.
We remain focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. As our primary solutions and services evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established risk management policies, including those related to information security and cybersecurity, and we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques. We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,700 employees and approximately 200 independent contractors. None of our workforce currently is unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with employees to be good.
Financial Information by Segment
In addition to our two reporting segments, we have a corporate organization that consists primarily of general and administrative expenses that are not included in the other segments. For financial information by reporting segment, see Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
