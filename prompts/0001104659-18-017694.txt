Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing novel cell therapies to patients, particularly in solid tumors. Our comprehensive and proprietary SPEAR (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and genetically engineer T-cell receptors (TCRs), and produce therapeutic candidates for administration to patients. Using our affinity engineered TCRs, we aim to become a fully integrated cell therapy company and to be the first company to have a TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication.
 
We have four SPEAR T-cells in clinical trials, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4, AFP and NY-ESO. Phase 1/2 clinical trials are ongoing in patients with various cancer tumor types including urothelial, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, esophageal, gastric, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular cancers and in synovial sarcoma, myxoid round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
 
Our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells have shown promising tolerability profiles with no evidence of off-target toxicities observed. In particular as of January 27, 2018, there have been no reports of any severe neurotoxic events similar to CAR-T cell related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). The MAGE-A10 triple tumor study dose escalation to 1 billion transduced cells, which is the dose previously observed to provide responses with our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell, has been recommended by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). In the MAGE-A10 NSCLC study, the SRC has recommended modification of the protocol to permit escalation of the patient dose to 1 billion transduced cells with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide preconditioning in the next treatment cohort. In the MAGE-A4 trial patient enrollment has started in bladder, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, NSCLC, esophageal and gastric cancers.
 
Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown promising initial results in clinical trials with a 50% response rate and a median projected overall survival of 120 weeks (~28 months) in Cohort 1 of synovial sarcoma (a solid tumor) and 76% overall response rate at day 100 in multiple myeloma. We have also now seen three partial responses (two confirmed and one to be confirmed) and one stable disease in the first four patients dosed in a second solid tumor indication, MRCLS. Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted PRIME regulatory access for our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication.
 
In September 2017, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) exercised its option to obtain an exclusive global license to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. Upon transition of the NY-ESO program to GSK which is anticipated to occur during 2018, GSK will assume full responsibility for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell including progression of the SPEAR T-cell into further clinical trials.
 
In January 2018, we announced that we had successfully manufactured the first SPEAR T-cells for a patient at our Navy Yard facility in Philadelphia. We intend to use the facility to manufacture SPEAR T-cells for all three of our wholly owned programs. In addition in January 2018 we also announced an agreement with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult for vector production in the U.K., which is intended to ensure vector supply for our ongoing and future clinical studies.
 
Our SPEAR T-cell platform is being utilized with the aim of maximizing both patient and disease indication coverage in a number of different ways.
 
·                  We are using our platform to identify and validate cancer targets for development of SPEAR T-cells in multiple indications. Within a given indication, the frequency of expression of these identified targets may be low, and may not be uniformly expressed in every cell within a tumor. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target antigens within selected disease indications to increase treatment potential for any given disease. For example the NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells address targets expressed in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.
 
·                  We are also developing SPEAR T-cells directed to targets which are closely related to a specific disease indication. The first of these SPEAR T-cells is our AFP SPEAR T-cell which is directed to hepatocellular cancer. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also being validated.
 
1




·                  Finally, we are identifying peptides to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types ensuring that for any given target, for example NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 or AFP, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.
 
We also recognize that further development of our SPEAR T-cells may be assisted by an enhancement in efficacy and durability of response. We therefore have a number of next generation and combination SPEAR T-cell strategies designed to further develop and engineer our SPEAR T-cells in addition to the initiation of combination therapy approaches, the first of which is with Merck & Co., Incs (Merck) KEYTRUDA®. In addition to our internal next generation programs, to enable continued innovation and development, we also have collaborations with third parties intended to promote further next generation solutions. These include our collaboration with Universal Cells, Inc. (Universal Cells) and our collaboration with Bellicum Pharmaceutical Inc. (Bellicum). With Universal Cells, we are looking to develop affinity engineered donor T cells that are universally applicable to all patients. While these universal cells would be specific for a given HLA type and target antigen, they would overcome the current limitation of autologous therapies that need to be manufactured specifically for each patient. The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering of cell surface proteins, without the use of nucleases, to develop universal T-cell products. If successful, this will enable us to treat patient populations with an off-the-shelf product. Our Bellicum collaboration was announced in December 2016 and under the collaboration, we will evaluate Bellicums GoTCR technology (inducible MyD88/CD40 co-stimulation, or iMC) with our SPEAR T-cells for the potential to create enhanced T-cell therapeutics.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our strategic objective is to be a world leader in discovering, developing and commercializing TCR-based T-cell therapies that transform the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer. We have an ambition to be a fully integrated cell therapy company and to have the first TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication. In order to achieve our objectives, we are focused on the following strategies:
 
Advance our clinical studies for our MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 and AFP SPEAR T-cells. We have four SPEAR T-cells with open INDs covering multiple indications, three of these being wholly owned. We plan to advance these wholly owned SPEAR T-cells further during 2018 with the aim of providing initial tolerability and response data for at least one wholly owned SPEAR T-cell during 2018. We are working with leading cancer centers including through our strategic alliance agreement with MD Anderson to advance our SPEAR T-cells.
 
Continue to use our SPEAR T-cell platform to generate SPEAR T-cells for cancers where existing therapeutic approaches are limited. We intend to continue to generate new SPEAR T-cells from our fully integrated technology platform, which enables the systematic identification and validation of suitable target peptides, T-cell cloning, engineering of TCRs and preclinical testing processes.
 
Continue to understand, further enhance and improve the effectiveness and persistence of our SPEAR T-cell therapies.  We continue to evaluate and work to understand the mechanism of action of our SPEAR T-cells, in particular the best approaches for further enhancing the effectiveness and persistence of our SPEAR T-cells. We continue to further develop our SPEAR T-cells by exploring the addition of other components in our lentiviral vector, which would be expressed in the SPEAR T-cells alongside the engineered TCR. In addition, we are evaluating the combination of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell with Mercks KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with multiple myeloma. This combination trial is anticipated to transition to GSK during 2018.
 
Optimize and expand our process development and manufacturing capabilities to maintain our leadership position in the TCR space. We have now opened our own SPEAR T-cell manufacturing facility at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, U.S. and have secured vector manufacturing capability within a manufacturing facility operated by the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult in the U.K. We will continue to expand our SPEAR T-cell and vector manufacturing capability during 2018. In addition we continue to optimize the manufacture, supply, associated analytical expertise and quality systems for our SPEAR T-cell therapies to ensure that our manufacturing capability is sufficient for later-stage clinical trials and, potentially, initial commercial supply.
 
Expand our intellectual property portfolio. We intend to continue building on our technology platform, comprising intellectual property, proprietary methods and know-how in the field of TCRs and T-cells. These assets form the foundation for our ability not only to strengthen our product pipeline, but also to defend and expand our position as a leader in the field of T-cell therapies.

Our SPEAR T-cell Therapies
 
The Immune System and T-cells
 
The immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Specifically, T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, and their receptors create a natural system that is designed to scan the body for diseased cells. In general, cells process proteins internally and then convert these proteins into peptide fragments which are then presented on the cell surface by a protein complex called the Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA. T-cells naturally scan all other cells in the body for the presence of abnormal peptide fragments, such as those generated from infectious agents. Recognition of this peptide-HLA complex takes place through the TCR expressed on the T-cells. Binding of naturally occurring TCRs to cancer targets, however, tends to be very poor because cancer proteins appear very similar to naturally occurring proteins on healthy cells and TCRs that recognize what the body sees as self-proteins are eliminated during early human development. Even when TCRs recognize cancer cells expressing novel proteins caused by mutations, elements of the immune system, or the cancer itself often suppress the T-cell response.
Target Identification and Validation
 
Before developing any engineered T-cell or TCR it is important to identify and validate a suitable target cancer peptide. The target must be expressed primarily only on the cancer cells of interest and with expression in normal non-cancerous tissue only where a risk to the patient would be deemed acceptable. Careful validation and identification of targets is important to ensuring that any engineered TCR is specific to the targeted cancer and does not bind to the same target on non-cancer cells, or that the TCR does not recognize a similar peptide derived from a protein in normal cells. Our target identification platform is focused on three approaches. First, we are using our platform to validate cancer testis antigens, for example the NY-ESO, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10 antigens. Second, we are using our platform to identify non-cancer testis antigens which are closely related to a specific disease indication, for example the AFP antigen which is closely related to hepatocellular cancer. Finally, we are identifying targets to different HLA types ensuring that for any given target, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.
Affinity Engineering
 
Following identification of a suitable target peptide, we identify TCRs that are capable of binding to that target peptide. We then engineer those identified TCRs to enhance and optimize their ability to target and bind to the cancer peptides, thereby enabling a highly targeted immunotherapy. The optimized TCR then undergoes extensive preclinical safety testing prior to administration to patients. Our SPEAR T-cell platform technology enables us to develop a pipeline of targets and TCR therapeutic candidates that we believe may be effective in a variety of cancer types that are unresponsive to currently available and experimental therapies. We have four SPEAR T-cells already in clinical trials (NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 and AFP) and a pipeline of SPEAR T-cells in development.
Administration to Patients
 
The process for treating a patient with an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate involves extracting the patients T-cells and then combining the extracted cells with our delivery system containing the gene for our affinity-enhanced TCR, through a process known as transduction. Our delivery system uses a type of self-inactivating (SIN) virus, known as SIN-lentivirus, to transduce the patients T-cells and is referred to as a lentiviral vector. The transduced T-cells are then expanded and infused into the patient. When these T-cells encounter a recognized HLA-peptide complex, they multiply and initiate the destruction of the targeted cancer cells.

Our Wholly Owned Clinical Product Pipeline
 

We have Phase 1 clinical trials ongoing with our wholly-owned MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 and AFP SPEAR T-cells in a total of eight tumor types including NSCLC, head and neck cancer, ovarian, urothelial, melanoma, esophageal, gastric and liver cancers and as shown in the table above.
Our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing with our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cell in NSCLC, urothelial, melanoma and head and neck cancers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most recently Spain. Initial safety data from the phase 1 studies has shown no evidence of off-target toxicity and as of January 27, 2018 there have been no reports of severe neurotoxic events similar to CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). Further data from our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cell trials is expected to be presented at the American Society of Cancer Oncology (ASCO) conference in June 2018.
·                  NSCLC: Approximately 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers are NSCLC, and smoking is by far the leading risk factor. About 40 percent of all NSCLCs are adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common in the United States and Europe being 25 to 30 percent of NSCLC. Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, and it is estimated that one out of four cancer deaths are from lung cancer. Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people, and approximately two out of three people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while less than two percent are younger than 45.
 
The initial clinical program in NSCLC is an open label Phase 1 modified 3+3 dose escalating study in patients with advanced stage NSCLC expressing the MAGE-A10 antigen. Patients receive preconditioning with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The primary objectives of the study are to assess safety and tolerability of our MAGE-A10 TCR therapeutic candidate in patients. Secondary objectives include the assessment of anti-tumor activity and durability of persistence. Enrollment of patients into this program is challenging, however the Safety Review Committee has now recommended a protocol modification to allow dose escalation to treatment of patients with 1 billion T-cells with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide preconditioning in the next treatment cohort, following the initial 100 million T-cell dose level.

·                  3-tumor trial: This is a Phase 1 open-label, modified 3+3 dose escalation study of  the MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cell in HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 positive patients with inoperable or metastatic urothelial cancer (transitional cell cancer of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis), melanoma, or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck expressing the MAGE-A10 antigen. Patients receive preconditioning with modified fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
 
·                  Urothelial: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer. These cancers mainly start in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract. Bladder cancer accounts for approximately five percent of all new cancers in the United States, and is the fourth most common cancer in men. Men are about three to four times more likely to get bladder cancer than women. It was estimated that 79,030 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed (about 60,490 in men and 18,540 in women), and about 16,870 deaths from bladder cancer will occur (about 12,240 in men and 4,630 in women) in the United States in 2017. Bladder cancer occurs mainly in older people, and approximately 9 out of 10 people with this cancer are over the age of 55.
·                  Melanoma: Melanoma is a cancer that begins in specific skin cells called melanocytes, and exposure to ultraviolet rays is a major risk factor for most melanomas. It is estimated that approximately 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women), and about 9,730 people were expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women) in the United States in 2017. The risk of melanoma increases as people age, and the average age at diagnosis is 63 years. However, melanoma is not uncommon among those younger than 30, and it is one of the most common cancers in young adults (especially young women).
·                  Head and Neck: Cancers of the head and neck, which include cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, salivary glands, and nose/nasal passages, account for approximately three percent of all malignancies in the United States. At least 75 percent of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. Infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is also a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers. In recent years, there has been a drop in the incidence of head and neck cancers caused by tobacco and alcohol, and a rise in the incidence of head and neck cancers caused by HPV.
 
Initial patients in this trial have been treated with 100 million T-cells. The Safety Review Committee has now recommended dose escalation to treatment of patients with the 1 billion cell dose.
 
Our MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
Enrollment in the MAGE-A4 SPEAR T-cell trial in urothelial, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, NSCLC, esophageal and gastric cancers is ongoing. Patients are initially being treated with an initial target dose of 100 million T-cells (safety dose). Multiple sites in the United States are now active and recruiting and will enroll up to 32 patients. Initial data is anticipated during 2018.
 
The Phase 1, open-label, modified 3+3 dose escalation study is in HLA*02 positive patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, and urothelial, head and neck, ovarian, non-small cell lung, esophageal, and gastric cancers expressing the MAGE-A4 target peptides. Patients will receive preconditioning with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
 
Our AFP SPEAR T-cell Therapy
 
We have a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of our alpha fetoprotein (AFP) therapeutic candidate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ongoing in the United States. The trial is also open in the United Kingdom and Spain. The Phase 1 clinical trial will include a dose escalation and expansion of a tolerable dose to explore initial evidence of anti-tumor activity.
 
AFP is a target peptide associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer in adults. Many patients who develop liver cancer have long-standing cirrhosis (scar tissue formation from liver cell damage), and early detection can be difficult because signs and symptoms often do not appear until later stages. It was estimated that approximately 40,710 new cases of liver cancer will be diagnosed (about 29,200 in men and 11,510 in women) and about 28,920 people will die from this disease (about 19,610 men and 9,310 women) in the United States in 2017.

Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell Therapy (partnered with GSK)
 

*Adaptimmunes accrual complete  
 **Ongoing
 MRCLS = myxoid/round cell liposarcoma
 
The NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell is currently in clinical trials in the United States and continues to show a promising tolerability profile in all clinical trials as of September 5, 2017 with no severe neurotoxic events similar to CAR-T cell related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) as at January 27, 2018.
 
On September 7, 2017, we announced that GSK had exercised its option under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement to exclusively license the right to research, develop and commercialize the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell. Further details on exercise of the option can be found in the Core Alliances and Collaborations section below.
 
Following exercise of this option by GSK, we are transitioning the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program to GSK, with full transition anticipated during 2018.
 
·                  Synovial Sarcoma:
 
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. There are approximately 50 types of soft tissue sarcomas, including synovial sarcoma, which is a malignant tumor of the soft tissues arising often around joints. Synovial sarcoma is associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation, and represents about nine percent of all soft tissue sarcomas. This disease is more common in children and young adults, and typically presents at an age ranging from 15 to 40 years. The majority of patients who develop metastatic soft tissue sarcomas are currently incurable, with 75% to 80% of patients not surviving past two to three years. First line therapy typically involves radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as surgical resection where possible. There are limited additional treatment options for unresectable, recurrent and metastatic synovial sarcoma, which is nearly always fatal, and systemic therapy is mainly used to provide palliation and slow disease progression.
 
There are four cohorts in the Phase 1/2 pilot study:
 
·                  Cohort 1 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  enrollment in this first cohort is now complete.
 
·                  Cohort 2 (patients with low NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  enrollment continues in this cohort.
 
·                  Cohort 3 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide alone)  only one confirmed response was observed in evaluable patients treated in cohort 3 and as a result, this cohort has now closed. The data from this cohort 3 suggest that fludarabine may be required as part of the pre-conditioning regimen.
 
6




·                  Cohort 4 (patients with high NY-ESO-1 antigen expression and lymphodepletion with a modified (lower) dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  given the lack of response seen in cohort 3, cohort 4 was opened and has now fully enrolled. We expect to present data comparing cohorts 1 and 4 during the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in June 2018.
 
As of September 2017, initial anti-tumor activity was observed in all ongoing cohorts, including low expressors of NY-ESO. NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells continued to be well-tolerated with all reported events of cytokine release syndrome resolved. There have been no reports of severe neurotoxicity safety events similar to CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) as of January 27, 2018 . One patient experienced a fatal bone marrow failure which was considered related to study treatment by the investigator in the trial. Internal investigations have not identified a mechanism by which the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cells may have caused this bone marrow failure. Survival data was promising with a median predicted overall survival of 120 weeks (~28 months) among the 12 treated patients in Cohort 1; or, 159 weeks (~37 months) for the ten patients in this cohort who received the target dose of greater than one billion cells.
 
The following diagram illustrates the response seen in one patient with synovial sarcoma in cohort 4 of our synovial sarcoma trial. The red circle indicates one of the two target lesions which was in the patients lung prior to treatment, at week 4 after T-cell infusion and up to week 8 after T-cell infusion.
 


Baseline (cohort 4) · 34 yr old female; synovial sarcoma lung · Prior therapies doxorubicin, ifosfamide,pazopanib, gemcitabine, 7 surgical resections · Showing target lesion 1 of 2, 54mm per RECIST(v1.1) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 4 · Had received 2.8 x 109 transduced T-cells · Partial response at 4 weeks · 90.7% decrease in target lesion 1, 77% decrease in both target lesions 1 and 2 per RECIST (v1.1) 
Week 8 · Partial response maintained · Target lesion 1 not measurable at week 12 due to reduction in size 

·                  MRCLS:
 
Enrollment in this program is continuing in the United States and the program is anticipated to transition to GSK during 2018. This is an open-label pilot study in patients to assess preliminary safety and efficacy in this indication. Initially, ten patients will be enrolled. If further characterization of the treatment is required, up to five additional patients may be enrolled. Eligible patients will be HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 with advanced (metastatic or inoperable) MRCLS whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 (defined as >30% of tumor cells that are 2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry). Patients receive preconditioning with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at the same dose that is being used in cohort 4 of our ongoing synovial sarcoma Phase 1/2 study.
 
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. There are more than 50 types of soft tissue sarcomas, including MRCLS, which is mostly located in the limbs (most
 
7




frequently in the thighs). MRCLS is a solid tumor associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation, and represents about 30 to 35 percent of liposarcomas and 5 to 10 percent of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. MRCLS commonly presents at an age ranging from 35 to 55 years.
 
The NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell appears to have a promising tolerability profile in MRCLS patients and initial responses have been observed in the first four patients dosed, with three partial responses (two confirmed and one to be confirmed) and one stable disease seen.
 
·                  Ovarian program:
 
Enrollment in the ovarian program has ceased. GSK will assume responsibility for any further development for this indication and any long term follow up for patients previously enrolled and treated in the program. To date no objective clinical responses have been reported in patients.
 
·                  Melanoma program:
 
Enrollment in the melanoma program has ceased. To date no objective clinical responses have been reported in patients.
 
·                  Myeloma program:
 
Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignancies of plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. It is estimated that approximately 30,280 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017 (17,490 in men and 12,790 in women). Multiple myeloma is characterized by several features, including low blood counts, bone and calcium problems, infections, kidney problems, monoclonal gammopathy, and by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells within bone marrow. The risk of multiple myeloma goes up as people age, and less than one percent of cases are diagnosed in people younger than 35. Most people diagnosed with this cancer are at least 65 years of age.
 
Interim results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma patients were reported in Nature Medicine, published on July 20, 2015. This trial has now closed. 25 patients were treated in the study. As at July 2017, the overall response rate at day 100 was 76% (1 sCR, 1 CR, 8 VGPR and 1PR). Three patients remain disease progression free at 39, 56 and 61 months post T-cell infusion. These results were reported in Blood, 130 (Supplement 1), 845.
 
Enrollment of patients has now started into a multiple myeloma combination study with Mercks anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). This trial is anticipated to transition to GSK during 2018. The study is evaluating the safety, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination.
 
·                 NSCLC program:
 
Enrollment in the NSCLC study has completed and GSK will assume responsibility for any further development for this indication. Any patients already enrolled in the NSCLC study will continue to be treated and followed for safety, efficacy and long term follow up.
 
The conduct and timing of any pivotal trial or other trials using the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell will be the responsibility of GSK following exercise of its option over the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program and full transition of the program to GSK.
 
Next Generation Technology and Manufacturing Platform Development
 
Next Generation Therapeutics
 
We believe that there is potential to enhance the potency and durability of our SPEAR T-cells, for instance by adding further active proteins into the lentiviral delivery system. These enhancements are designed to result in next generation SPEAR T-cells for future clinical programs. We have multiple development programs ongoing which are researching different modifications to our SPEAR T-cells. For example, we have an active development program for a dnTGFBRII SPEAR T-cell. This next generation SPEAR T-cell is designed to block immune suppression by TGFB in certain tumor microenvironments, thereby enhancing the activity and duration of response seen with our SPEAR T-cells within those environments. We are also considering CD8 constructs where the aim is to promote the antigen spread, anti-tumor memory and tumor inflammation seen with our SPEAR T-cells.

Manufacturing Improvements
 
We now have our own SPEAR T-cell manufacturing capability at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patient SPEAR T-cell manufacture for our wholly owned assets has started. Control of our own manufacturing process enables to improve and further develop our processes for manufacture of our lentiviral vector and SPEAR T-cells. Our goal is to achieve a more consistent and efficient manufacturing process and ultimately to reduce the cost of supply.
 
We have made a number of changes to our current SPEAR T-cell manufacturing process. In particular, we are now streamlining some of the manual steps in the process by simplifying the initial T-cell selection through increased use of the antibody-bound magnetic Dynabeads® CD3/CD28. We have also introduced cryopreservation steps which make the logistics of administering our SPEAR T-cells more flexible for patients and which also facilitate treatment of patients outside the United States. Expansion and harvest of the SPEAR T-cells is now serum-free after initial culture preparation and is being further optimized. Finally, we are also working towards automation of parts of the manufacturing process.
 
For the vector supply, we are developing and evaluating alternative approaches to increase volume and continuity of supply while at the same time decreasing the cost of the vector supply. We are also collaborating with the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult for the provision of a module within its manufacturing facility at Stevenage, UK to enable our own manufacturing of vector and further enhance our ability to optimize the vector manufacturing process.
 
Core Alliances and Collaborations
 
We have entered into core alliance or collaboration agreements with GSK (collaboration and license agreement), MD Anderson (collaboration designed to expedite the development of T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer); Merck (clinical trial collaboration agreement for the assessment of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy in combination with Mercks PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with multiple myeloma); Universal Cells (collaboration relating to gene editing and HLA-engineering technology); and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Co-Development and Co-Commercialization Agreement).

We entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with GSK in May 2014 (the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement) regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of TCR therapeutic candidates. The collaboration is for up to five programs, the first being the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program and the second the PRAME SPEAR T-cell program.
 
On September 7, 2017 we announced that GSK had exercised its exclusive option for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. As part of the option exercise a transition plan was agreed between us and GSK for the transition of the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell clinical trials and program to GSK. Transition is expected to occur during 2018. Following transition of the program to GSK, GSK will assume full responsibility for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program including any ongoing clinical trials. As a result of the option exercise, we will receive up to £48 million (~$61 million) from GSK over the course of the transition period. This includes development milestones of up to £18 million (~$23 million) and an option payment of £30 million (~$38 million), which also allows GSK to nominate two additional targets following completion of the transition. Successful continuation of development and subsequent commercialization of NY-ESO would trigger additional payments for development milestones, tiered sales milestones, and mid-single to low double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales.
 
In relation to the second target nominated, Adaptimmune will be responsible for taking the PRAME SPEAR T-cell program through preclinical testing and up to Investigational New Drug (IND) application filing. GSK is responsible for the IND filing itself. GSK has an exclusive option over the program. Under the terms of the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, the potential development milestones eligible related to the PRAME program could amount to approximately $300 million, if GSK exercises its option and successfully develops this target in more than one indication and more than one HLA type. Adaptimmune would also receive tiered sales milestones and mid-single to low double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales.
 
Three other targets may be nominated by GSK at specified times under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, excluding any research programs already in progress by Adaptimmune. Upon nomination by GSK of any of these three additional targets, we will grant to GSK an exclusive option on each target, which can be exercised up to four months after approval of an IND application in relation to a TCR therapeutic candidate directed against the nominated target. Nomination also triggers the start of a collaboration program to develop the relevant TCR therapeutic candidate directed to the nominated target peptide.

Following exercise of any option (including the options for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell and PRAME SPEAR T-cell programs), we will grant to GSK an exclusive worldwide license under intellectual property rights specific to the SPEAR T-cell developed under the relevant collaboration programs. GSK will, at its own expense, be fully responsible for all further development and commercialization of the relevant T-cell candidates. The licenses do not include a right for GSK to develop alternative affinity-enhanced TCRs using our intellectual property rights or to develop other TCR therapeutic candidates directed to different target peptides. Under the agreement, we are also prohibited from independently developing or commercializing T-cell therapeutics directed at the targets subject to outstanding options granted to GSK.
 
Under the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $42.1 million in June 2014 and are entitled to various milestone payments based on the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones. As of December 31, 2017, we had achieved development milestones of $49.3 million.
 
In addition to the development milestones, we are entitled to royalties from GSK on all GSK sales of SPEAR T-cells licensed under the agreement, varying between a mid-single-digit percentage and a low-double-digit percentage of net sales, subject to certain agreed reductions, dependent on the cumulative annual net sales for each calendar year. Royalties are payable while there is a jointly owned or solely owned valid patent claim covering the SPEAR T-cell in the country in which the relevant SPEAR T-cell is being sold and, in each case, for a minimum of 10 years from first commercial sale of the relevant TCR therapeutic. Sales milestones also apply once any TCR therapeutic covered by the GSK Collaboration and License Agreement is on the market.
 
The GSK Collaboration and License Agreement is effective until all payment obligations expire, including any ongoing royalty payments due in relation to GSKs sale of any covered TCR therapeutic candidates. The agreement can also be terminated on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis by GSK for lack of feasibility or inability to meet certain agreed requirements. Both parties have rights to terminate the agreement for material breach upon 60 days written notice or immediately upon insolvency of the other party. GSK has additional rights to terminate either the agreement or any specific license or collaboration program upon 60 days written notice to us. Additional payments may be due to us as a result of such termination, and where we continue any development of any TCR therapeutic candidate resulting from a terminated collaboration program, depending on the stage of development, royalties may be payable to GSK at a mid-single-digit percentage rate of net sales. We also have rights to terminate any license where GSK ceases development or withdraws any licensed SPEAR T-cells in specified circumstances.
 
Details of the relationship are also set out in Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third Parties  We rely heavily on GSK for our NY-ESO TCR therapeutic candidate clinical program, which may also affect other SPEAR T-cell programs.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our SPEAR T-cells and processes, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection including data/market exclusivity for our SPEAR T-cells and SPEAR platform technology, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.
 
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing an initial priority filing at the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and/or the U.S. Patent Trademark Office (USPTO). This is followed by the filing of a patent application under the Patent Co-operation Treaty claiming priority from the initial application(s) and then application for patent grant in, for example, the United States, Europe (including major European territories), Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals to ensure that we obtain relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and our SPEAR T-cells or TCRs. We will additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including as relevant exclusivity through orphan or pediatric drug designation. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our underlying platform technology, manufacturing processes and SPEAR T-cells.
 
As of December 31, 2017 we owned or jointly owned approximately 150 granted patents (of which 15 are U.S.-issued patents) and 107 pending patent applications (of which 7 are U.S. National patent applications). These patents and patent applications include claims directed to our SPEAR T-cells, our platform technology used to identify and generate engineered TCR therapeutic candidates, our next generation SPEAR T-cell technology and our manufacturing and process technology.

The initial priority patent applications were filed in the UKIPO and patent applications under the applicable Patent Co-operation Treaty have since been filed claiming priority from that U.K. patent application.
 
Platform Technology
 
We jointly own a number of platform technology patents and patent applications. These are jointly owned with Immunocore Limited (Immunocore), a company with whom we have historically had a shared development history, and are directed to certain aspects of the process that we use to engineer our SPEAR TCRs. For example, patents directed to the di-sulphide bond stabilization technique required to solubilize TCRs for isolation, characterization and validation have been issued in major territories including Australia, Canada, China, major European territories (including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy), India, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and South Africa and are expected to expire beginning in 2022. Patents have also been granted in relation to our phage display approach for TCRs and are expected to expire beginning in 2023. The priority patent application was filed in 2002 and patents are now granted in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, major European territories (including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy), Japan, South Africa, India, Norway and New Zealand. Other examples include an issued patent directed to a method for increasing the affinity of given TCRs to a target peptide (expected to expire in 2025) and patent applications directed to decreasing off-target reactivity and selection for the affinity-enhanced TCRs.
 
For further information on Immunocore, see further Related Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third PartiesWe have a shared development history with Immunocore and as a result jointly-own certainly intellectual property rights which are required for our ongoing business.
 
Novel targets
 
We have filed 29 patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty which cover peptides expressed on the tumor cell surface and the TCRs which recognize them. The applications as filed cover 872 peptides from 63 different target proteins.
 
TCR libraries
 
We have filed 10 patent applications which cover large libraries of TCR genes which we have generated and the method of their generation: these act as proprietary sources for screening for TCRs which are the starting points for affinity engineering into clinical candidates.

Manufacturing Process Patents and Patent Applications
 
We also have know-how and patent applications that we own which relate to the manufacture of our SPEAR T-cells. For example, we have filed patent applications in the major territories, which claim priority from initial priority patent applications filed at the USPTO and UKIPO, which are directed to a particular modification to the lentiviral vector technology. We believe this modification enhances the safety profile of the lentiviral vector technology. A further patent application has been filed on enhancing the activity of our manufactured T-cells, and two further patent applications on increasing the efficiency of manufacture of our T-cell product are expected to be filed shortly.
Next Generation Approaches
 
We have recently filed a priority generating patent application in relation to a gene which prevents our cytotoxic T-cells from being inhibited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A patent application under the applicable Patent Co-operation Treaty has since been filed claiming priority from that U.K. patent application and a patent application was filed in the US for accelerated prosecution under the Cancer Immunotherapy Pilot Program. This is potentially relevant to all of our SPEAR T-cells in solid tumor indications and protects one of the next generation SPEAR T-cell products under development.
Exclusive License for Bead Products
 
In December 2012, we entered into two agreements, a license and a sub-license, with ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. (ThermoFisher). The license agreement grants us a field-based exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by ThermoFisher in relation to the methods of use of the ThermoFisher Scientific Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology to isolate, activate and expand T cells and enable transfection of the T cells with any TCR genes to manufacture our licensed products and use and sell those TCR products to treat cancer, infectious disease and/or autoimmune disease. The licensed field relates to the ex-vivo activation and expansion of human T cells containing engineered TCRs for use as a therapy for treating cancer, infectious disease and/or autoimmune disease and where the therapy comprises the steps of (a) removing a sample containing T cells from a patient; (b) isolating T cells from that sample using the ThermoFisher bead product or similar magnetic beads; (c) transfecting those isolated T cells with a gene or genes encoding engineered TCRs of known antigen specificity; (d) activating and expanding the population of those engineered T cells using the ThermoFisher bead product or similar magnetic beads; and (e) introducing the expanded, engineered T cells back into the same patient. The license is not sub-licensable, but we are able to sub-contract manufacture of the licensed products to our contract manufacturing organizations. Our sub-licensees have access to the required license directly from ThermoFisher under the above-described intellectual property rights on terms equivalent to those we have obtained from ThermoFisher in relation to our partnered licensed products.
 
We have granted an option under the license agreement to ThermoFisher to take an exclusive license under any improvements made by or for, or controlled by, us to the ThermoFisher patented technology to the extent any such improvements are dominated by the patent rights licensed to us. Any license will be outside of the exclusive field we have been granted, namely engineered T-cell therapy.
 
Under the license agreement, we have to demonstrate reasonable commercial efforts to carry out development and commercialization of the licensed products and we are required to make certain expenditures for research and development relating to the commercialization of the licensed products. This obligation is deemed satisfied upon first commercial sale of a licensed product. We have certain payment obligations under the license agreement including an upfront license fee of $335,000, which has already been paid, minimum annual royalty (in the low tens of thousands of U.S. dollars prior to licensed product approval and thereafter at a level of 50% of running royalties in the previous year), milestone payments (payable for each licensed product on achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones per licensed product) and a low single-digit running royalty payable on the net selling price of each licensed product. The license agreement will last until the expiration of the latest to expire of the licensed patent rights. The license agreement can be terminated before the end of its term by mutual agreement, by ThermoFisher on the occurrence of certain events (failure to use reasonable commercial efforts, willful making of a false statement of a material fact, breach of antitrust laws or other laws, material breach of the agreement, payment default or if we have challenged the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents). The license may also be terminated in the event of insolvency by either party.
 
12




We also have a field-based exclusive sub-license under certain other patents which cover the method of use of the Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 and are controlled by ThermoFisher under a head-license from the University of Michigan, the U.S. Navy and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The sub-license has the same relevant exclusivity scope and field-based restrictions and many of the terms are equivalent to those set out in the main license agreement with ThermoFisher, including the same requirement to demonstrate reasonable commercial efforts to carry out development and commercialization of the licensed products as in the main license agreement with ThermoFisher. We have certain payment obligations under the sub-license agreement including an upfront license fee of $665,000, which has already been paid, minimum annual royalty (in the tens of thousands of U.S. dollars prior to product approval and thereafter at a level of 50% of running royalties in the previous year), milestone payments (payable for each sub-licensed product on achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones per sub-licensed product) and a low single-digit running royalty payable on the net selling price of each sub-licensed product. The sub-license agreement will last until the expiration of the latest to expire of the sub-licensed patent rights. The sub-license agreement can be terminated before the end of its term by mutual agreement, by ThermoFisher or the head licensors on the occurrence of certain events (failure to use reasonable commercial efforts, willful making of a false statement of a material fact, failure to adequately meet any requirement for public use required under Federal regulations, breach of antitrust laws or other laws, material breach of the agreement, payment default or if we have challenged the validity or enforceability of any of the sub-licensed patents). The sub-license may also be terminated in the event of insolvency by either party. The sub-license has an additional requirement that any manufacture of engineered TCR products for sale in the United States must occur in the United States and reserves rights for the U.S. government to use the technology in accordance with 35 USC §200 et seq. and for the University of Michigan, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to use the technology for non-commercial research purposes. The aggregate milestone payments payable per product under the license and sub-license agreements do not exceed $5 million.
 
On June 16, 2016, the Company entered into a supply agreement with ThermoFisher for the supply of the Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology. The Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 technology is used in our manufacturing process to isolate, activate and expand patient T-cells.  The supply agreement runs until December 31, 2025. Under the supply agreement, the Company is required to purchase its requirements for CD3/CD28 magnetic bead product exclusively from ThermoFisher for a period of 5 years and there are also minimum purchasing obligations. ThermoFisher has the right to terminate the supply agreement for material breach or insolvency.
 
See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third PartiesWe rely heavily on ThermoFisher and the technology we license from them.
 
Immunocore Limited
 
We have an assignment and license agreement in place with Immunocore that relates to certain co-owned patents, patent applications and rights in know-how that were originally developed by Avidex and subsequently acquired by Medigene. The patents, patent applications and rights in know-how are now fully co-owned by Adaptimmune and Immunocore. Each company utilizes the jointly owned patents and know-how within separate fields or applications, with our focus being on the treatment of patients with our SPEAR T-cells and Immunocores focus being on the treatment of patients with soluble TCRs. There are no termination rights in the assignment and license agreement.
 
See further Related Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Reliance Upon Third PartiesWe have a shared development history with Immunocore and as a result jointly-own certainly intellectual property rights which are required for our ongoing business.
 
Other Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights
 
Third-party patents do exist that purport to cover some or all of our current lentiviral vectors/systems or our process for manufacture. However, the majority of these patents will expire prior to any commercial supply by us of any TCR therapeutic candidates and we do not currently require a license. Whether licenses are required under any remaining third-party patents or other third-party patents depends on what steps we take going forward in relation to our lentiviral transduction process and manufacturing process. We may, however, need to negotiate a license under any remaining third party patents or develop alternative strategies for dealing with any remaining third party patents if licenses are not available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.
 
From time to time, we will use samples or cell lines obtained from third parties in order to identify either suitable targets or TCRs that bind to certain targets. The agreements under which samples are provided vary between third parties and certain third parties require entry into license agreements. These agreements may also contain payment obligations relating to the use of the various samples or the information obtained from use of those samples.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a strong emphasis on proprietary products and intellectual property. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any SPEAR T-cells that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
 
Immunotherapy is an active area of research and a number of immune-related products have been identified in recent years that are alleged to modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T-cell activation. More recently, bi-specific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the TCR, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand work by targeting receptors that inhibit T-cell effectiveness and proliferation and essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include: antibody-drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses, cancer vaccines. A variety of cell-based autologous and allogeneic approaches are also being researched and developed, including but not limited to: CAR-T cell, TCR T cell, GammaDelta T cell, CAR-NK cell, NK cell, NKT cell and CTL.
 
·                  CAR-T in hematological malignancies: Engineered T cell therapeutics have been identified using antibody recognition systems engineered into T cells, so-called CAR-T cells. For the majority of approaches, CAR-T cells have access to extracellular proteins only and are independent of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). A number of targets in hematological malignancies have been well characterized including, but not limited to: BCMA, CD4, CD5, CD19, CD22, CD20, CD33, CD38, CD70 and CD123. In 2017, the US FDA approved two CD-19 directed autologous CAR-T cell products, which are commercially available: Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel; Novartis) for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse, and Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. In addition a number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions are researching and developing autologous and allogeneic CAR-T therapies to a variety of target antigen. Many of these CAR-T cells in development are undergoing pivotal or Phase I/II clinical trials and some could seek marketing approval submissions during 2018 and beyond.
 
·                  CAR-T in solid tumors: In addition to hematological malignancies, there are a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic CAR-T therapies in the solid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical and clinical development, as well as directed towards a broad target spectrum, including but not limited to: EGFR, GD2, HER-2, IL13rα2, Lewis Y, L1-CAM, Mesothelin, MUC16, PSCA, PSMA and ROR1.
 
·                  CARs & TCR-mimics targeting peptide-HLA complexes: Most CAR-T therapies in development are directed towards antigen targets. However competitors are also developing a CAR-T that selectively binds to the peptide-HLA (pHLA) complex (the natural binding site for endogenous TCR). Furthermore, competitors are also looking at pHLA antibodies or TCR mimic antibodies that can either be engineered in T-cells or developed as standalone antibody therapies in cancer indications (both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors). Targets of such pHLA CAR-T or TCR mimic antibodies include: AFP, CD19, BCMA, NY-ESO-1, p53 and WT1.
 
·                  TCR T-cells: Competitors are developing TCR T-cells (including affinity engineered T-cells) that are directed towards a multitude of targets including: HPV-16 E6, KRAS, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, MAGE A3/A6, NY-ESO-1, PRAME and WT1. Juno Therapeutics has developed an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate where the end TCR is purported to have enhanced affinity through stem-cell selection. Junos candidate JTCR016 (WT1-specific TCR), in collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is currently undergoing a Phase 1/2 trial in NSCLC and mesothelioma setting as well as a separate Phase 1/2 in AML. Data from the NSCLC trial is likely to emerge in 2018. Medigene AG has reported development of a PRAME TCR therapeutic candidate, which is due to begin Phase 1/2 clinical investigation in AML, MM and myelodysplastic syndromes.
 
·                  Other cell-based approaches: In addition to all the adoptive cell therapy approaches above, our competitors are also investigating the potential of GammaDelta T cell, CAR-NK cell, NK cell, NKT cell and CTLs either in a preclinical or clinical setting (both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors).

Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice (DOJ), or other governmental entities.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, therapeutic products, including drugs, biologics, and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Some biological products are subject to regulation under the FDC Act. Most biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) via a Biologics License Application (BLA). The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are generally similar to those for new drug applications (NDAs), and biologics are associated with generally similar, if not greater, approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 
Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
15




Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 
In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,335,000, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $110,000 per product and $569,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication may require clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 
FDA Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
 
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND application or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high.
 
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH convenes the RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RACs decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Under the fast track program and FDAs accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post- marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
 
17




Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of human clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Additional Controls for Biologics
 
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 
18




Biosimilars
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a biological product may be deemed biosimilar to an FDA-approved biological product or reference biological product upon a showing that there are no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity generally must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. On March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of marketing exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and in addition no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilars application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain marketing approval through the pre-market approval (PMA) process for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 
19




The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA finds the PMA application is approvable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
 
In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Act amended the federal false claims law such that a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
20




Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that implements a statutory requirement under the Healthcare Reform Act that requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies that are covered under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to begin collecting and reporting annually information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers had to begin collecting information in 2013, with the first reports due in 2014. On September 30, 2014, CMS posted the first round of data in searchable form on a public website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 
Europe and Rest of the World Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions both due to our location and the fact that we are engaging in clinical programs outside of the United States and will want to obtain worldwide regulatory approval for our TCR therapeutic candidates. In particular we have clinical trials ongoing in the UK and Spain and will be subject to regulations relating to performance of those clinical trials and manufacture and supply of our SPEAR T-cells and patient materials in the UK and Spain. Prior to supplying any TCR therapeutic candidate in any country or starting any clinical trials in any country outside of the United States we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in such countries. The existence of a United States regulatory approval does not guarantee that regulatory approvals will be obtained in other countries in which we wish to conduct clinical trials or market our TCR therapeutic candidates. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively prior to any clinical trial being conducted in the relevant country. A marketing authorization is then submitted prior to any commercial supply, again to each relevant countrys national health authority.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. However these requirements may well differ from country to country.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products outside of the United States
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
21




Procedures Governing Approval of Products in the EU
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
