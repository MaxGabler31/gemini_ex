Our Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 29, 1988 under the name Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. On April 27, 2004, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc. On April 13, 2006, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc., and on May 5, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On March 15, 2012, the Company changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc.
 
In early 2017, our management team elected to suspend further investment and working capital on developing its then-existing technology and business prospects, turning its attention to the hemp-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, market. On March 10, 2017, the Company changed its name to Bespoke Extracts, Inc. to align the Company’s corporate identity with its new business plan. 
 
The Company is now focused on selling its proprietary line of premium quality, all natural cannabidiol (CBD) products in the form of tinctures and capsules for the nutraceutical and veterinary markets, which it introduced in mid-2018. Produced using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD, our products are marketed as dietary supplements and distributed through our direct-to-consumers ecommerce store, found at www.BespokeExtracts.com. In the future, we plan to also sell through select specialty retailers, pharmacies/dispensaries and care providers.

The Cannabis Market
 
Many states have already legalized medical cannabis, and adult-use cannabis is now legal at the statewide level in several major U.S. markets. According to ArcView Market Research and its research partner BDS Analytics, over the next 10 years, total sales by the legal cannabis industry will reach $57 billion by 2027, and the largest group of cannabis buyers will be in North America, going from $9.2 billion in 2017 to $47.3 billion a decade later. For context, in a report released in February 2017, Arcview Market Research stated that the North American black market for cannabis is estimated to have totaled $46.4 billion in sales in 2016. Marijuana Business Factbook reports that 2017 spending on legal recreational and medical cannabis in the U.S. even topped those of Oreos and organic produce combined – and will likely surpass sales of firearms and ammunition in the nation by the end of 2019.
 
CBD, one of over 80 active cannabinoid chemicals found in cannabis, is the major non-psychoactive component of the plant Cannabis sativa L.; and is proving to be an effective treatment for a number of health conditions affecting adults, children and pets. While U.S. companies cannot legally make medical claims about CBD or its uses, there are countless scientific research studies showing potential therapeutic indications for CBD, demonstrating that it works well with body cells to improve immunity and is even produced naturally in the human brain.
 
According to a 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, CBD benefits include acting in some experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antiemetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent; and is therefore a potential medicinal treatment for neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting and nausea, anxiety and schizophrenia. Moreover, there have been dozens of other peer-reviewed studies suggesting that CBD may have therapeutic value for medical indications including bipolar disorder, cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Huntington’s Disease, Crohn’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, rheumatoid arthritis and Tourette’s Syndrome. 
 
Due to the growing body of published research supporting the promising therapeutic benefits of CBD, the demand for CBD products has been increasing rapidly. In fact, cannabis industry analysts at the Brightfield Group estimate the hemp-CBD market alone could reach $22 billion by 2022. Between 2017 and 2018, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market has nearly doubled in size, but the five-year growth projections for this market are now dramatically higher than they were a year ago. This is because the full legalization of hemp-derived CBD is now a real and likely prospect following Republican Mitch McConnell’s proposal of the Hemp Farm Act of 2018 (the Farm Bill), which is expected to pass before the end of 2018. This legislation would clearly and unambiguously legalize hemp as well as its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including hemp-derived CBD. 
 
Introductory Product Line
 
Generally speaking, our management believes most CBD products for oral consumption available on the market have an earthy, bitter taste that some observers suggest is reminiscent of chlorophyll. The centerpiece of our introductory retail product line is our great-tasting, flavor-infused tinctures, formulated using only premium, organic ingredients. In addition, we will also market CBD extract in capsule form. As our Company matures, we expect to expand our proprietary CBD products to include a much broader range of flavors and form factors. Launched in late summer 2018, our official market debut showcased the following introductory products:



● | Manuka Honey CBD Tincture: 1000 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract infused with raw, organic, UMF16+ Manuka Honey – available in a 60ml tincture; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lemon Lime CBD Tincture for Sport: 1500 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract –available in 60ml tincture; 
● | Bacon CBD Tincture for Pets: 500 mg of all-natural, smoked bacon-flavored, pure hemp-derived CBD extract – available in 2 fluid ounce tincture with convenient spray top for dosing on pet food; and

Supply, Manufacturing and Logistics
 
Our management believes that some companies operating in the CBD oil industry tend to emphasize sales and quantity over quality and safety. In late February 2015, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued several warning letters to companies who claimed that their products contained CBD but, following testing of these products by the FDA, were found to have no CBD.
 
All of our flavor-infused tinctures and capsules are formulated using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD sourced from one of the largest, fully and vertically integrated producers of PCR hemp oil. All CBD isolates and oils are authenticated by an independent third party via issuance of a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”), which cannabinoid content and profile, microbiological content, heavy metal content, pesticide content, and residual solvent content. We recognize the importance of compliance and is partnered with one of the industry’s leading CGMP certified extraction facilities. This ensures the consistency and quality of our product line and brand.
 
Through its proprietary engineering process, our American-based supplier isolates and removes any unwanted compounds – while creating the maximum potency level of phytocannabinoids and terpenes – cold, enclosed and continuous manufacturing processes prevents the degradation of natural molecules during extraction and purification. Made and derived from non-GMO, USA-grown hemp, its PCR hemp oil and isolate powder are subjected to a rigorous testing system – both in-house and verified through independent, third party labs – which ensures accurate levels of phytocannabinoids and confirms the absence of THC. Our products contain only the highest level of naturally derived CBD, more than 99.5% pure, and never contain any THC.
 
We believe that a key differentiator of our finished products is the superb quality of ingredients we source from the industry’s leading suppliers, each of whom we have carefully vetted and qualified.
 
For instance, raw Mānuka honey used in our products is imported directly from the north island of New Zealand from a supplier which has been supplying quality bee products since 1974. Mānuka honey is believed to be one of the most unique and beneficial forms of honey in the world and may carry the industry’s highest UMF®16+ rating, distinguishing it as superior high-grade Manuka. Produced by bees that pollinate the native Manuka bush, possible Mānuka honey uses range from healing sore throats and digestive illnesses to curing Staph infections and gingivitis. All other flavorings infused in our products – including our all-natural, organic lemon lime flavor used in our Bespoke Sport offering -- are also sourced from reputable suppliers.
 
Fulfillment of orders from our online customers is managed by a well-established third-party logistics partner.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently sell our products through our website.
 
Management believes that the traditional retail environment is currently experiencing notable economic instability due largely to the global shift in consumer purchasing behaviors – with online shopping/ecommerce sites rapidly overtaking brick-and-mortar stores as consumer preferred shopping venues. In view of this retailing reality, we have adopted a Direct-to-Consumer sales model that is anchored by an ecommerce website whereby we educate, sell, and ship our CBD products directly to consumers. In addition, we also plan to market our CBD products on a wholesale basis to select specialty retailers, dispensaries and physicians.
 
Our marketing initiatives include the use of social marketing, social influence marketing, direct response marketing, inbound marketing, email marketing, Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”) and content marketing, among other proven strategies to generate and convert sales prospects into loyal, satisfied customers. We will also explore utilizing coupon and deal sites to drive traffic to our website and retailers, as well as participate in select industry conferences to promote our brand and build greater awareness of our products among prospective business partners and consumers.

Other brand-building tactics include a sports marketing and sponsorship strategy that has initially focused on Extreme Sports, motor racing and other high action sports athletes, teams and events, with the underpinning goal of generating consumer awareness of our high-performance Lemon-Lime Sport CBD brand by fans and athletes. In March 2018, we were a titled sponsor of sportsbike racer Robertino Pietri who took third place at the 77th annual running of the DAYTONA 200; and in October 2018, we were a title sponsor of motorcycle racer Sean Dylan Kelly who competed in and won first place at the 35th Annual Race of Champions at Daytona International Speedway.
 
The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana
 
Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis Sativa L.” However, cultivators of the cannabis plant have manipulated it over the years to encourage specific traits to become dominant. Cannabis plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 80 different cannabinoids thus far, but management believes THC is the most well-known and is credited with causing the marijuana high. While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp contains very little of the psychoactive chemical. The foregoing is one of the differences which distinguishes hemp from marijuana. 
 
Hemp was originally cultivated nearly 10,000 years ago in what is modern day Taiwan. Ancient cultivators of the cannabis plant recognized that it was dioecious, meaning that it had dual characteristics. Cultivators grew one variety of the cannabis plant to be tall and durable. This became what we now call industrial hemp. Upon discovering that the flower buds of the cannabis plant had psychoactive effects, cultivators began separating the hemp plants from the flowering plants in order to isolate their “medicinal” characteristics.
 
Scientifically, we now know that industrial hemp plants tend to produce high levels of the cannabinoid CBD, while producing low amounts of THC. Conversely, the marijuana plant produces high THC levels and low CBD levels. This chemical difference dictates the way we use the cannabis plant for medicinal and dietary supplemental purposes.
 
Federal Legislative Overview
 
Cannabidiol, or CBD, that is derived from industrial hemp plants — like the CBD used in all products currently being produced or to be produced by Bespoke Extracts — is deemed by the FDA to be a dietary supplement, not a medication. Consequently, in the U.S., no prescription is required to obtain CBD and it can be legally purchased and consumed in all 50 states (and in 40 countries around the world).
 
However, in December 2016, the Department of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) implemented a new rule that declared CBD as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.” While numerous industry insiders have expressed concerns about the DEA’s new ruling, it is widely believed that the agency would struggle to make CBD illegal under current laws, thanks to multiple protections put in place by Congress as part of the 2014 Farm Bill. Moreover, subsequent additions to the 2015 and 2016 Congressional Appropriations Act prohibit the DEA from going after the products produced under these programs. Moreover, the most recent version of the legislation to legalize growing hemp was introduced in April 2018, with Senate Majority Speaker Mitch McConnell as the primary sponsor, which quickly evolved into the Senate’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill). On December 3, 2018, House and Senate leaders announced that they had come to an agreement on the reconciled version of the 2018 Farm Bill, which – for the first time ever – includes a provision to lift the federal government’s longstanding ban on the commercial production of industrial hemp. It also amends the Federal Controlled Substance Act of 1970 so that industrial hemp containing no more than 0.3% THC is no longer classified as a Schedule I prohibited substance. The vote to approve the 2018 Farm Bill is expected to occur prior to the end of this year.
