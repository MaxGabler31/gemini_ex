Item 1. | Business

Introduction
Founded in 1847, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. Additionally, we operate an iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. By 2020, we expect to be the sole producer of HBI in the Great Lakes region with the development of our first production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders with operating and financial transparency.
We are organized through a global commercial group responsible for sales and delivery of our products and operations groups responsible for the production of the iron ore that we market. Our continuing operations are organized according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore.
In the U.S., we currently own or co-own four operational iron ore mines plus one indefinitely idled mine. We are currently operating one iron ore mine in Michigan and three iron ore mines in Minnesota. All four mines are currently operating at or near full capacity. The Empire mine located in Michigan was indefinitely idled beginning in August 2016. Our Asia Pacific operations consist solely of our Koolyanobbing iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. Koolyanobbing is currently operating at a level appropriate for the current price discounting environment for low-grade iron ore products containing less than 62% Fe, and we expect mining operations to cease during 2018.
We are Focused on Protecting our Core U.S. Iron Ore Business 
We are the market-leading iron ore producer in the U.S., supplying differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major North American blast furnace steel producers. We have the unique advantage of being a low-cost, high-quality producer of iron ore pellets in the Great Lakes market with significant transportation and logistics advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market effectively. The pricing structure and long-term nature of our existing contracts, along with our low-cost operating profile, position U.S. Iron Ore as a strong cash flow generator in most commodity pricing environments. Since instituting our strategy in 2014 of focusing on this core business, we have achieved significant accomplishments, including providing volume certainty by signing a ten-year supply agreement with our largest customer; substantially reducing operating costs by making operational improvements; and developing new pellet products to meet ever-evolving market demands.
We recognize the importance of our strength in the U.S. Iron Ore business, and our top strategic priority is to protect and enhance our market position. This involves continuing to deliver high-quality, custom-made pellets that allow our customers to remain competitive in the quality, production efficiency, and environmental friendliness of their steel products. Protecting the core business also involves continually evaluating opportunities to expand both our production capacity and ore reserve life. In 2017, we achieved key accomplishments toward these goals by acquiring the remaining minority stake in our Tilden and Empire mines as well as additional real estate interests in Minnesota.
Expanding our Customer Base
While we hold a strong market position in supplying iron ore to Great Lakes blast furnaces, we cannot ignore the ongoing shift of steelmaking share in the U.S. away from our core blast furnace customers to EAF steelmakers. Over the past 25 years, the market share of EAFs has nearly doubled. However, as EAFs have moved to higher value steel products, they require more high-quality iron ore-based metallics instead of scrap as raw material feedstock. As a result of this trend, one of our top strategic priorities is to become a critical supplier of the EAF market by providing these specialized metallics. In June 2017, we announced the planned construction of an HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. HBI is a specialized high-quality iron alternative to scrap that, when used as a feedstock, allows the EAF to produce more valuable grades of steel. We expect our HBI to partially replace the over 3 million metric tons of ore-based metallics that are imported into the Great Lakes every year from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and Venezuela. 
Our Toledo plant is expected to produce HBI at a rate of 1.6 million metric tons per year when brought to production in 2020. We expect that this will create additional demand for our DR-grade pellets of 2.5 million long tons. Not only does this production plant create another outlet for our high-margin pellets, but it also presents an attractive economic opportunity for us. As the only producer of DR-grade pellets in the Great Lakes and with access to abundant, low-cost natural gas, we will be in a unique position to serve clients in the region. In addition, the Toledo site is in close proximity to over 20 EAFs, giving us a natural competitive freight advantage over import competitors.

Business Segments
Our Company’s continuing operations are organized and managed according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore.
Segment information reflects our business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition.  Financial information about our segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and NOTE 2 - SEGMENT REPORTING.
U.S. Iron Ore 
We are a major producer of iron ore pellets, primarily selling production from U.S. Iron Ore to integrated steel companies in the U.S. and Canada. We operate four iron ore mines: the Tilden mine in Michigan and the Northshore, United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota. The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 27.4 million long tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 55% of total U.S. pellet production capacity. Based on our equity ownership in these mines, our share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 21.2 million long tons, representing 42% of total U.S. annual pellet capacity. The Empire mine located in Michigan, which historically had annual rated capacity of 5.5 million long tons, was indefinitely idled beginning in August 2016. During 2017, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interest of the Empire and Tilden mines from ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, respectively.
The following chart summarizes the estimated annual pellet production capacity and percentage of total U.S. pellet production capacity for each of the respective iron ore producers as of December 31, 2017:

U.S. Iron Ore Pellet

Total U.S. mines | 49.9 | | 100.0 | %
1 Empire mine was excluded from the estimated capacity calculation as it is indefinitely idled.

Our U.S. Iron Ore production generally is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements with various price adjustment provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we produced a total of 25.5 million long tons of iron ore pellets. The 2017 U.S. Iron Ore production included 18.8 million long tons for our account and 6.7 million long tons on behalf of current and previous steel company partners of the mines. During 2016 and 2015, we produced a total of 23.4 million and 26.1 million long tons, respectively. 
We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard, fluxed and DR-grade, for use in our customers’ operations as part of the steelmaking process. The variation in grades of iron ore pellets results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine, the requirements of end user's steelmaking process and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. Although the grade or grades of pellets currently delivered to each customer are based on that customer’s preferences, which depend in part on the characteristics of the customer’s steelmaking operation, in certain cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably. Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required 
4

to add to the blast furnace. DR-grade pellets require additional processing to make a pellet that contains higher iron and lower silica content than a standard pellet. Unlike standard or fluxed pellets, DR-grade pellets are fed into a direct reduced iron facility, which then are converted into DRI or HBI, a high-quality raw material used to feed an EAF.
Additionally, as the EAF steel market continues to grow in the U.S., there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce DRI, HBI and/or pig iron.  In 2016 and 2017, we produced and shipped industrial trials of low-silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in two customers' DRI reactors to produce a high-quality DRI product. By 2020, we expect to sell these low-silica DR-grade pellets to our own HBI facility in Toledo, Ohio.
Each of our U.S. Iron Ore mines is located near the Great Lakes. The majority of our iron ore pellets are transported via railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to blast furnace steelmakers in North America.
Our U.S. Iron Ore sales are influenced by seasonal factors in the first half of the year as shipments and sales are restricted due to closure of the Soo Locks and the Welland Canal on the Great Lakes because of winter weather. During the first quarter, we continue to produce our products, but we cannot ship most of those products via lake vessel until the conditions on the Great Lakes are navigable, which causes our first and second quarter inventory levels to rise. Our limited practice of shipping product to ports on the lower Great Lakes or to customers’ facilities prior to the transfer of title has somewhat mitigated the seasonal effect on first and second quarter inventories and sales under our current accounting policies, as shipment from this point to the customers’ operations is not limited by weather-related shipping constraints. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had 1.5 million long tons of pellets in inventory in the lower Great Lakes or at customers’ facilities.
Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the timing and pattern of revenue recognition will change for our U.S. Iron Ore segment. Due to the closure of the Soo Locks and the Welland Canal during the winter months, our revenues will be lower than historical levels during the first quarter and higher than historical levels during the remaining three quarters in future years. However, the total amount of revenue recognized during the year should remain substantially the same as under current GAAP. There will not be a material change in the pattern or timing of revenue recognition for Asia Pacific Iron Ore.
U.S. Iron Ore Customers
Our U.S. Iron Ore revenues primarily are derived from sales of iron ore pellets to the North American integrated steel industry, consisting primarily of three major customers. Generally, we have multi-year supply agreements with our customers. Sales volume under these agreements largely is dependent on customer requirements, and in certain cases, we are the sole supplier of iron ore to the customer. Historically, each agreement has contained a base price that is adjusted annually using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that could result in a price adjustment include changes in the Platts 62% Price, along with pellet premiums, published Platts international indexed freight rates and changes in specified Producer Price Indices, including those for industrial commodities, fuel and steel.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we sold 18.7 million, 18.2 million and 17.3 million long tons of iron ore product, respectively, from our share of production from our U.S. Iron Ore mines. Refer to Concentration of Customers below for additional information regarding our major customers.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore
Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of our wholly-owned Koolyanobbing operation.
The Koolyanobbing operation serves the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. The variation in the two export product grades reflects the inherent chemical and physical characteristics of the ore bodies mined as well as the supply requirements of our customers. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we produced 10.1 million, 11.8 million and 11.7 million metric tons, respectively. 
Koolyanobbing is a collective term for the ore deposits at Koolyanobbing, Mount Jackson and Windarling. There are approximately 70 miles separating the three mining areas. Banded iron formations host the mineralization, which is predominately hematite and goethite. Each deposit is characterized with different chemical and physical attributes and, in order to achieve customer product quality, ore in varying quantities from each deposit must be blended together.
5

Crushing and blending are undertaken at Koolyanobbing, where the crushing and screening plant is located. Once the blended ore has been crushed and screened into a direct lump and fines shipping product, it is transported by rail approximately 360 miles south to the Port of Esperance, via Kalgoorlie, for shipment to our customers in Asia.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore Customers
Asia Pacific Iron Ore’s production is under contract with steel companies primarily in China, Japan and South Korea. In March 2017, we extended the majority of our supply agreements with steel producers in China for one year. These contracts will expire in March 2018, and we will only renew contracts if it can be done in an economically viable manner. Our supply agreement with our client in South Korea expired in December 2017. We renewed that agreement for 2018; however, it is at a lower committed quantity than our previous agreement. Our supply agreements with our customers in Japan expire in March 2018. These contracts could be renewed for additional volume. Pricing for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore Chinese customers consists of shorter-term pricing mechanisms of various durations up to three months based on the average of daily spot prices that are generally associated with the time of unloading of each shipment. Pricing with our Japanese and South Korean customers is generally similar to the inputs used with our Chinese customers, but the pricing inputs are fixed before shipment.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we sold 9.8 million, 11.6 million and 11.6 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from our Koolyanobbing operation. No Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2017, 2016 or 2015. The segment’s five largest customers together accounted for a total of 57%, 56% and 47% of Asia Pacific Iron Ore product revenues for the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Discontinued Operations
Prior to late March 2014, we operated two iron ore mines in Eastern Canada, the Bloom Lake mine and the Wabush Scully mine. In late March 2014, we idled our Wabush Scully mine in Newfoundland and Labrador and in November 2014, we began to implement the permanent closure plan for the mine. The idle and ultimate closure was driven by the unsustainable high-cost structure. In January 2015, we ceased active production at the Bloom Lake mine and the mine transitioned to "care-and-maintenance" mode. Together, the shutdown of the Wabush Scully mine and the cessation of operations at our Bloom Lake mine represented a complete curtailment of our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations.
Restructuring proceedings with respect to the Bloom Lake Group were commenced under the CCAA in the first quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, the CCAA protection granted to the Bloom Lake Group was extended to include the Wabush Group to facilitate the reorganization of each of their businesses and operations. As of December 31, 2017, CCAA proceedings are still ongoing. The Monitor appointed by the court in the CCAA proceedings for the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group has conducted a claims process pursuant to which creditors have filed claims against the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group. The Monitor is reviewing all claims filed as part of this claims process. Currently, there is uncertainty as to the amount of the distribution that will be made to the creditors of the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group, including, if any, to us, and whether we could be held liable for claims that may be asserted by or on behalf of the Bloom Lake Group or the Wabush Group or by their respective representatives against non-debtor affiliates of the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group. During 2017, we became aware that it was probable the Monitor will assert a preference claim against us and/or certain of our affiliates. Given that it is probable the claim will be asserted by the Monitor, we have recorded an estimated liability of $55.6 million, which includes the value of our related-party claims against the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group. Should the Monitor proceed to assert the claim, we believe the Monitor will demand an amount in excess of the value of our related-party claims against the estate. Thus, it is possible that a change in the estimated liability may occur in the future. We deny liability for any amount and will vigorously defend such claim.
Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment discontinued operations and the status of the CCAA proceedings.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
Applied Technology, Research and Development
We have been a leader in iron ore mining and process technology since inception and have been in operation for over 170 years.  We operated some of the first mines on Michigan’s Marquette Iron Range and pioneered early 
6

open-pit and underground mining methods.  From the first application of electrical power in Michigan’s underground mines to the use of today’s sophisticated computers and global positioning satellite systems, we have been a leader in the application of new technology to the centuries-old business of mineral extraction.  Today, our engineering and technical staffs are engaged in full-time technical support of our operations, improvement of existing products and development of new products.
We are a pioneer in iron ore pelletizing with over 60 years of experience.  We are able to produce customized pellets to meet each customer’s blast furnace specifications and produce both standard and fluxed pellets. Using our technical expertise and strong market position in the United States to increase our product offering, we have started producing DR-grade pellets.  In 2017 and 2016, we shipped low silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in multiple DRI reactors to produce a high-quality direct reduced iron product.
With our experienced technical professionals and unsurpassed reputation for our pelletizing technology, we continue to deliver a world-class quality product to our customers. We are a pioneer in the development of emerging reduction technologies, a leader in the extraction of value from challenging resources and a front runner in the implementation of safe and sustainable technology.  Our technical experts are dedicated to excellence and deliver superior technical solutions tailored to our customer base. We will continue to use this pioneering mentality in the development of our HBI facility in Toledo, Ohio. Similar to the market shift to pellets over 60 years ago, we recognize the need to serve the growing EAF market.
Concentration of Customers
In 2017 and 2016, two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue and in 2015, three customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue. Product revenue from those customers represented in the chart below totaled $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion of our total consolidated product revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is attributable to our U.S. Iron Ore business segment. The following represents sales revenue from each of these customers as a percentage of our total consolidated product revenue, as well as the portion of product sales for U.S. Iron Ore that is attributable to each of these customers for those years:

 | | Percentage of TotalProduct Revenue | | Percentage of U.S. Iron OreProduct Revenue
Customer1 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
ArcelorMittal | 38% | | 37% | | 37% | 48% | 51% | 49% 
AK Steel | 23% | | 19% | | 21% | 29% | 27% | 29% 
Algoma2 | 9% | | 4% | | 12% | 11% | 5% | 15% 
1 Includes subsidiaries. 
2 On October 5, 2015, we terminated the long-term agreement with Algoma; however, we entered into certain short-term contracts with Algoma throughout 2016. On May 16, 2016, we reinstated our agreement with Algoma, which took effect in January 2017. 

ArcelorMittal
Historically, our pellet supply agreements with ArcelorMittal USA were based on customer requirements, except for the Indiana Harbor East facility, which is based on customer contract obligations. The legacy agreements with ArcelorMittal USA expired at the end of December 2016 and January 2017. The parties executed a new long-term agreement, which became effective October 31, 2016, for the sale and delivery of ArcelorMittal USA’s annual tonnage requirements that fall within a specific range of volume. This latest agreement expires at the end of December 2026.
ArcelorMittal USA is a 62.3% equity participant in Hibbing. During 2017, we acquired the 21% ownership interest of ArcelorMittal USA in Empire as part of an agreement to distribute the noncontrolling interest net assets of the mine. 
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to ArcelorMittal were 8.4 million, 9.7 million and 9.7 million long tons, respectively. 
7

AK Steel
In August 2013, we entered into a new agreement with AK Steel to provide iron ore pellets to AK Steel for use in its Middletown, Ohio and Ashland, Kentucky blast furnace facilities. This contract includes minimum and maximum tonnage requirements for each year between 2014 and 2023. 
In 2015 we entered into an amended and restated agreement with AK Steel after it acquired Severstal Dearborn, LLC, under which we supply all of the Dearborn, Michigan facility’s blast furnace pellet requirements through 2022, subject to specified minimum and maximum requirements in certain years.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to AK Steel were 5.6 million, 4.5 million and 4.3 million long tons, respectively. 
Algoma
Algoma is a Canadian steelmaker whose common shares are owned by Essar Steel Holdings Limited. We had a long-term supply agreement under which we were Algoma’s sole supplier of iron ore pellets through the end of 2016. Under the terms of a 2016 settlement and through Algoma's CCAA proceedings, Algoma agreed to assume the long-term supply agreement that runs through 2024. Additionally, we entered into agreements with Algoma to purchase from us incremental tonnage that equates to Algoma's 2015 through 2017 annual iron ore pellet consumption. These agreements began in 2017 and 2018 and run through December 2020.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to Algoma were 2.5 million, 1.2 million and 2.5 million long tons, respectively.
Competition
Throughout the world, we compete with major and junior mining companies, as well as steel companies, both of which produce steelmaking raw materials, including iron ore.
North America
In our U.S. Iron Ore business segment, we primarily sell our product to steel producers with operations in North America. We compete directly with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the United States and/or Canada, including ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, and with major iron ore pellet exporters from Eastern Canada and Brazil. 
A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our iron ore. Continued demand for our iron ore and the prices obtained by us primarily depend on the consumption patterns of the steel industry in the U.S., China and elsewhere around the world, as well as the availability, location, cost of transportation and competing prices. 
Asia Pacific
In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment, we export iron ore products to the Asia Pacific markets, including China, Japan, and South Korea. In the Asia Pacific marketplace, we compete with major iron ore exporters primarily from Australia and Brazil. These include BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Rio Tinto plc and Vale SA, among others.
Competition in steelmaking raw materials is predicated upon the usual competitive factors of price, availability of supply, product quality and performance, service and transportation cost to the consumer of the raw materials. 
Environment 
Our mining activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.
Environmental issues and their management continued to be an important focus at each of our operations throughout 2017. In the construction of our facilities and in their operation, substantial costs have been incurred and will continue to be incurred to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid undue effect on the environment. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled approximately $21 million, $15 million and $17 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately $5 million of the 2015 capital expenditures relating to environmental matters was attributable to the North American Coal operations that were sold during December 2015. It is estimated 
8

that capital expenditures for environmental improvements will total approximately $11 million in 2018, which is related to our U.S. Iron Ore operations for various water treatment, air quality, dust control, tailings management, selenium management and other miscellaneous environmental projects.
Regulatory Developments
Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect us, our customers and our suppliers in many areas, including waste discharge and disposal, the classification of materials and products, air and water discharges and many other environmental, health and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws or regulations reasonably would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations.
Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: Minnesota's proposed amendments to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard; evolving water quality standards for sulfate, selenium, and conductivity; scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of “Waters of the United States”; Minnesota's Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; Climate Change and GHG Regulation; Regional Haze FIP Rule; NO2 and SO2 NAAQS; and increased administrative and legislative initiatives related to financial assurance obligations for CERCLA, mining and reclamation obligations.
Minnesota’s Proposed Amendments to the Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard
The Minnesota Legislature provided $1.5 million in 2011 for a study to gather additional information about the effects of sulfate and other substances on the growth of wild rice and to support an update to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard originally adopted in 1973 by the MPCA. The MPCA contracted with the University of Minnesota to conduct several research projects as part of this study. Concurrently, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce contracted an independent lab to conduct companion research on the impacts of sulfate on wild rice. In August 2017, MPCA released proposed amendments of the sulfate water quality standard applicable to wild rice and identification of wild rice waters, which included a proposed sulfate wild rice water quality standard, a proposed list of waters where the standard would apply, and criteria for adding waters to that list. The proposed wild rice water quality standard is an equation that utilizes measured sediment parameters to calculate a sulfate water quality standard protective of wild rice unique to each water body where the standard applies. The independent research conducted by the independent lab contracted by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce does not directly support the validity of the MPCA’s proposed approach. On January 11, 2018, the proposed rule was substantially disapproved by an ALJ and included a recommendation for MPCA to retain the existing 10 mg/L sulfate standard until MPCA addresses concerns identified in the ALJ report. These findings are not binding on the MPCA. The rulemaking has a legislated deadline for completion of January 15, 2019. Due to the proposed standard being based on measured sediment parameters, uncertainty regarding to which waters the standard will apply, and the non-binding disapproval from the ALJ, the impact of the proposed wild rice water quality standard to us is not estimable at this time but it could have an adverse material impact if we are required to significantly reduce sulfate in our discharges.
Conductivity
Conductivity, the measurement of water’s ability to conduct electricity, is a surrogate parameter that generally increases as the amount of dissolved minerals in water increases. In 2011, the EPA issued A Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Conductivity in Central Appalachian Streams, which established a recommended conductivity benchmark of 300 µS/cm for the region. The issuance of a benchmark outside of the established rulemaking process was subsequently the subject of litigation in 2012 where the court ruled the benchmark is nothing more than a non-binding suggestion. Three years later in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, et al. v. Elk Run Coal Co., et al., 3:12-cv-00785 (S.D. W. Va.), a judicial decision held that levels of conductivity higher than the EPA’s benchmark constituted a violation of the state’s narrative water quality standards, were unsupported by science and contrary to decisions previously made by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the West Virginia Supreme Court. In 2015, a group filed a petition with EPA Region 5 alleging that Minnesota was failing to implement properly the state NPDES program, and one of the various allegations asserts that MPCA should be assessing compliance with the state’s narrative water quality standard against the EPA’s conductivity benchmark for the Central Appalachian region. On December 30, 2015, the EPA provided MPCA a draft of the Protocol for Responding to Issues Related to Permitting and Enforcement which indicates that EPA staff will be reviewing available scientific basis in peer reviewed literature as well as promulgated standards. In February 2016, EPA's Office of Research and Development endorsed use of the Field-Based Conductivity Benchmark in northeast Minnesota indicating that a value of 320 µS/cm was appropriate to protect aquatic life. On 
9

December 23, 2016, EPA issued a notice soliciting public comments on its draft document, Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity. According to EPA, once this document is final, states and authorized tribes located in any region of the country may use the methods to develop field-based specific conductivity criteria for adoption into water quality standards. In April 2017, comments were submitted by our trade associations providing objective evidence indicating the draft methodology was scientifically flawed and unfit for promulgation. Adoption of this methodology is not certain due to significant concerns with respect to the scientific validity of the proposed method which is now under intense review by scientists working for various trade associations. Because the outcome of the Region 5 Petition is uncertain and the proposed Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity is only draft guidance at this time, the exact nature and certainty of the potential risk to us cannot be predicted; however, direct application of the 320 µS/cm benchmark to our Minnesota-based assets may have a material adverse impact if the conductivity benchmark is applied to our NPDES permits.
Definition of “Waters of the United States” Under the Clean Water Act
In June 2015, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers promulgated the rule, “Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’ Under the Clean Water Act,” which attempted to add clarity to which waters are jurisdictional under the federal Clean Water Act, and will apply to all Clean Water Act programs, including certain permitting programs, spill prevention programs and a state certification process.  It is unclear how the federal and state agencies will implement and enforce the final rule, and how the courts will interpret it going forward. The regulation may expand EPA’s authority under the Clean Water Act to many traditionally unregulated mine features such as mine pits, pit lakes, on-site ditches, water retention structures, and tailings basins creating a new burden on our U.S. facilities.  This could be further interpreted to add questionable regulatory authority over the groundwater connections between these features and nearby traditionally navigable waters.  In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of this rule while the jurisdiction and legality of the rule are decided in court. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to reconsider the Sixth Circuit's decision that it has jurisdiction to hear challenges. We are actively participating in the rulemaking development and assessing the potential impacts to our operations. Any impacts to us are not estimable at this time as the rule is being litigated, and the impacts will not be known until the rule is finally implemented. 
The “Executive Order on Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the ‘Waters of the United States’ Rule” ("Executive Order") was signed by the President on February 28, 2017. This Executive Order instructs EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review the Clean Water Rule and “publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule.” The Executive Order further directs that they “shall consider interpreting the term ‘navigable waters’” in a manner “consistent with Justice Scalia’s opinion” in Rapanos v. United States (2006). The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers are in the process of conducting rulemaking, soliciting comments, and holding public meetings in accordance with the Executive Order. Any impacts to us are not estimable at this time as the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers have only begun to implement the Executive Order.
Selenium Discharge Regulation
In Michigan, Empire and Tilden have implemented compliance plans to manage selenium according to the permit conditions. Empire and Tilden submitted the first permit-required Selenium Storm Water Management Plan to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") in December 2011 and have updated it annually as required. The Selenium Storm Water Management Plans have outlined the activities that have been undertaken to address selenium in storm water discharges from our Michigan operations including an assessment of potential impacts to surface and groundwater. The remaining infrastructure needed for implementation of the storm water collection and conveyance system was completed in 2017 and cost approximately $8 million. A storm water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated sometime before 2028. The cost of the future treatment systems could be significant, although we are continuing to assess and develop cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies. 
Tilden's NPDES permit contains a compliance schedule for selenium with a final effluent limit of 5.1 µg/l that became effective as of November 1, 2017, at Tilden's Gribben Tailings Basin outfall.  Tilden's 2017 expenditures totaled approximately $3 million for infrastructure necessary to meet the selenium effluent limit. 
In July 2016, the EPA published new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria, which may someday increase the cost for treatment should MDEQ adopt these new standards in lieu of the existing limits established under the Great Lakes Initiative. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or long-term impact of the water quality criteria to our business.

Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy
Since the 1990’s the taconite industry has voluntarily reduced and removed mercury products and supported development of mercury emission reduction technology. While TMDL regulations are contained in the Clean Water Act, in 2007, Minnesota developed a Statewide Mercury TMDL which set an objective for 93% mercury air emission reductions from 1990 levels for sources within Minnesota. The State of Minnesota has acknowledged that approximately 90% of the mercury entering the state’s airshed is from other national and international sources. 
In September 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rule mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reductions from certain sources. The rule is applicable to all of our Minnesota operations and requires submittal of a Mercury Reduction Plan to reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces by 72% by January 2025. The Mercury Reduction Plans must be submitted by December 31, 2018. One of the main tenets agreed upon for evaluating potential mercury reduction technologies during TMDL implementation and 2014 rule development proceedings was that the selected technology would meet the following “Adaptive Management Criteria”: the technology must be technically feasible; must be economically feasible; must not impact pellet quality; and must not cause excessive corrosion in pellet furnaces, associated duct work and existing wet scrubbers on the furnaces. However, the final 2014 rule does not explicitly include all four Adaptive Management Criteria for evaluating mercury reduction technologies, which were agreed upon in Minnesota’s October 2009 Mercury TMDL Implementation Plan.
There is currently no proven technology to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to the target level of 72% that would meet all four Adaptive Management Criteria. We remain concerned about the technical and economic feasibility to reduce taconite mercury emissions by 72% without impacting existing operations or other environmental permit obligations. We are in the process of conducting detailed engineering analysis and potential technology testing to determine the impact of the regulations on each unique taconite furnace affected by this rule. The results of this analysis will guide further dialogue with the MPCA regarding development of the 2018 Mercury Reduction Plans. Potential impacts to us are not estimable at this time as the development of potential mercury reduction technology remains in its early stages.
Climate Change and GHG Regulation
With the complexities and uncertainties associated with the U.S. and global navigation of the climate change issue as a whole, one of our potentially significant risks for the future is mandatory carbon pricing obligations. Policymakers are in the design process of carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. The current regulatory patchwork of carbon compliance schemes presents a challenge for multi-facility entities to identify their near-term risks. Amplifying the uncertainty, the dynamic forward outlook for carbon pricing obligations presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change utilizing our formal ERM process. As an energy-intensive business, our GHG emissions inventory includes a broad range of emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, diesel mining equipment and our wholly owned Silver Bay power generation plant, among others. As such, our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts), and (2) indirect costs passed through to us from electrical and fuel suppliers (indirect impacts).
Internationally, mechanisms to reduce emissions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. We expect that momentum to extend carbon regulation will continue with implementation of the Paris climate agreement that was adopted in 2015, the aim of which is to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation may have a material impact on our customer base, operations and financial results in the future.
In the U.S., federal carbon regulation potentially presents a significantly greater impact to our operations. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional, and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to GHG control and potential carbon pricing impacts. In May 2010, the EPA promulgated the GHG Tailoring Rule establishing a mechanism for regulating GHG emissions from facilities through the Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting program under the Clean Air Act. Under the GHG Tailoring Rule, as modified by a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding some components of the rule, new projects that increase GHG emissions by a significant amount (generally more than 75,000 long tons of CO2 emissions per year) and significantly increase emissions of at least one non-GHG criteria pollutant are subject to the Prevention of Significant 
11

Deterioration requirements, including the installation of best available control technology. We do not expect the Tailoring Rule provision to have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term and we cannot reliably estimate the long-term impact of the regulation. 
In June 2013, President Obama issued a memorandum directing EPA to develop carbon emission standards for both new and existing power plants under the Clean Air Act's New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS"). In October 2015, EPA promulgated a CPP which consists of NSPS regulating carbon dioxide from existing power plants at a level of approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP would not regulate combined heat and power generating facilities such as at Northshore's Silver Bay Power. The CPP directed states to submit SIPs to EPA by September 2016, but on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP immediately halting implementation. In March 2017, President Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order which called for, among other things, a review of the CPP and, if appropriate, reconsideration proceedings to suspend, revise, or rescind the rule. On the same day, Administrator Pruitt signed a notice indicating EPA’s intent to review and, if appropriate, to propose to revise or rescind the CPP. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has been holding CPP litigation in abeyance since April 2017. On October 10, 2017, following a review as directed by President Trump’s Energy Independence Executive Order, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP and accepted comments on the proposed rule until January 16, 2018. The ultimate outcome of these carbon emission standards is not expected in the near term.
Due to the EPA's Tailoring Rule and potential patchwork state or regional carbon restriction schemes, our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on GHG emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced substantially by numerous factors, including currently contemplated regulatory flexibility mechanisms, such as allowance allocations, fixed process emissions exemptions, offsets and international provisions; emissions reduction opportunities, including energy efficiency, biofuels, fuel flexibility, emerging shale gas, coal mine methane offset reduction; and business opportunities associated with pursuing combined heat and power partnerships and new products, including DR-grade pellets, fluxed pellets and other efficiency-improving technologies.
We have worked proactively to develop a comprehensive, enterprise-wide GHG management strategy aimed at considering all significant aspects associated with GHG initiatives to plan effectively for and manage climate change issues, including risks and opportunities as they relate to the environment; stakeholders, including shareholders and the public; legislative and regulatory developments; operations; products and markets.
Regional Haze FIP Rule
In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to its regional haze rules. The rules require states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all Class I national parks and wilderness areas to natural background levels by 2064. Among the states with Class I areas are Michigan and Minnesota, in which we currently own and manage mining operations. The first phase of the regional haze rule required analysis and installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology ("BART") on eligible emission sources and incorporation of BART and associated emission limits into SIPs.
EPA disapproved Minnesota's and Michigan's SIPs for taconite furnaces and instead promulgated a Taconite Regional Haze FIP in February 2013. We, along with other stakeholders, petitioned the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the FIP, and in May 2013, we filed a joint motion for stay of the 2013 FIP, which was granted in June 2013. We, along with the other stakeholders, reached a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve certain items in the 2013 FIP. The settlement agreement, which was published in the Federal Register in January 2015 and fully executed in April 2015, prompted EPA to grant partial reconsideration of the 2013 FIP in July 2015. Subsequently, EPA published a FIP revision final rule to implement components of the settlement agreement in April 2016, with an effective date of May 12, 2016. We believe the 2016 Regional Haze FIP reflects progress toward a more technically and economically feasible regional haze implementation plan. In November 2016, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals terminated the June 2013 stay and extended the deadlines in the original 2013 FIP. Cost estimates associated with implementation of the 2013 and 2016 FIPs are reflected in our five-year capital plan.
Due to inconsistencies in language describing the procedures for calculating NOx emission limits between the settlement agreement and the 2016 FIP final rule, we jointly filed a Petition for Reconsideration and Petition for Judicial Review in June 2016. We have been working toward a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve the outstanding issue with the emission limit calculation method and anticipate resolution of the issue in 2018. The outcome of this proceeding is not expected to have a material adverse impact to the business.

NO2 and SO2 NAAQS
During the first half of 2010, EPA promulgated rules that required each state to use a combination of air quality monitoring and computer modeling to determine each state's attainment classification status against new one-hour NO2 and SO2 NAAQS. During the third quarter of 2011, the EPA issued guidance to the regulated community on conducting refined air quality dispersion modeling and implementing the new NO2 and SO2 standards. In 2012, Minnesota issued Administrative Orders ("AOs") requiring taconite facilities to conduct modeling to demonstrate compliance with the NO2 and SO2 NAAQS pursuant to the Taconite Regional Haze SIP Long Term Strategy ("LTS"). Compliance with the LTS modeling demonstrations was originally set for June 30, 2017, but Minnesota has not advanced work on its 2012 AOs and is expected to remove NAAQS modeling obligations under the LTS in light of reduction in haze emissions associated with implementation of the taconite Regional Haze FIP regulations.
All of our operations in Minnesota and Michigan are expected to be in attainment for NO2 and SO2 NAAQS without incurring additional capital investment. While we will continue to monitor these developments and assess potential impacts, we do not anticipate further capital investments will be necessary to address NO2 and SO2 NAAQS requirements at this time.
CERCLA 108(b)
In December 2016, EPA published a proposed amendment to CERCLA section 108(b) which is focused on developing financial assurance for managing hazardous substances in the hardrock mining industry. EPA had a court-mandated deadline for publication of the final rule by December 1, 2017. The proposed rule would have required hardrock mining facilities to calculate their level of financial responsibility based on a formula included in the rule, secure an instrument or otherwise self-insure for the calculated amount, demonstrate to EPA the proof of the security, and maintain the security until EPA releases facilities from the CERCLA 108(b) regulations. The iron mining industry notified EPA of several errors upon which EPA drafted the rule, including a mistaken reliance on reporting data from a wholly different industry sector (iron and steel toxic release inventory reporting). We also participated in developing industry specific and national trade association comments and advocating directly with EPA and the White House Office of Management & Budget to address this and other errors with goals of exempting iron ore mining from CERCLA 108(b) applicability and correcting other deficiencies with the proposed rule. On December 1, 2017 EPA signed a federal register notice of EPA's decision not to issue final regulations for financial responsibility requirements for the hardrock mining industry under section 108(b) of CERCLA because EPA determined that the risks associated with these facilities' operations are addressed by existing federal and state programs and regulations and modern industry practices.
Energy
Electricity
As of February 2015, Wisconsin Electric Power Company is the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden mine. During April 2015, the Tilden mine executed a special electricity contract with Wisconsin Electric Power Company. The term of the contract is through 2019. Wisconsin Electric Power Company provides 170 megawatts of electricity to Tilden at special rates that are regulated by the MPSC. The pricing under these contracts is generally fixed except Tilden is subject to frequent changes in Wisconsin Electric Power Company's power supply adjustment factor. During August 2016, Tilden executed a new 20-year special contract with Wisconsin Electric that is anticipated to start on January 1, 2020. 
Tilden and Empire may also incur additional liabilities depending on the outcome of various proceedings concerning MISO's revised cost allocation methodology for continued operation of the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. If FERC's award of SSR costs based on a revised cost allocation methodology applied retroactively is affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, this could result in a cash payment of $12.3 million related to our Tilden mine and our indefinitely-idled Empire mine. As of December 31, 2017, this liability is included in our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position as part of Accrued expenses. Refer to NOTE 20 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES for further discussion of the Michigan Electricity Matters.
Minnesota Power supplies electric power to the Hibbing and United Taconite mines. During September 2008, Hibbing finalized an agreement with terms from November 2008 through December 2015. The agreement was approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ("MPUC") in 2009. The terms of the agreement included an automatic five-year extension that began January 2016. The United Taconite mine executed a new ten-year agreement with Minnesota Power that also included the Babbitt Mine. This agreement was finalized in May 2016 and was approved by the MPUC in November 2016.

Silver Bay Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary with a 115 megawatt power plant, is able to provide the majority of Northshore’s electrical energy requirements. Silver Bay Power has an interconnection agreement with Minnesota Power for backup power when excess generation is necessary. In May 2016, Silver Bay Power entered into an agreement with Minnesota Power to purchase roughly half of Northshore's electricity needs from Minnesota Power through 2019. On January 1, 2020, Silver Bay Power will purchase 100% of the electricity requirements of Northshore from Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power plans to idle both of its generating units except under certain circumstances.
Koolyanobbing and its associated satellite mine deposits draw power from independent diesel-fueled power stations and generators. Diesel power generation capacity has been installed at the Koolyanobbing operations.
Process and Diesel Fuel
We have a long-term contract providing for the transport of natural gas on the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline for our U.S. Iron Ore operations. Tilden has the capability of burning natural gas, coal or, to a lesser extent, oil. Hibbing and Northshore have the capability to burn natural gas and oil. United Taconite has the ability to burn coal, natural gas and petroleum coke. Consistent with 2017, we expect during 2018 our U.S. Iron Ore operations will utilize both natural gas and coal to heat furnaces and produce power at our Silver Bay Power facility. 
All of our mines utilize diesel fuel mainly for our mobile fleet. Thompson Gas supplies diesel fuel to all of our U.S. Iron Ore locations from the Husky refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. Our U.S. Iron Ore locations are contracted with Thompson Gas through the end of 2018.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 2,938 employees.

2 Excludes contracted mining employees. 
3 Excludes employees considered on lay-off status as a result of an indefinite or temporary idle.
4 Includes employees of our HBI project. 

Hourly employees at our Michigan and Minnesota iron ore mining operations, excluding Northshore, are represented by the USW and are covered by labor agreements between the USW and our various operating entities. These labor agreements that cover approximately 1,800 active USW-represented employees at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan, and our United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota are valid through September 30, 2018. Employees at our Northshore operations are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Hourly employees at our LS&I railroads are represented by seven unions covering approximately 100 employees. The labor agreements that cover these employees reopened for bargaining on December 31, 2014 and we are actively bargaining for successor agreements. These employees negotiate under the Railway Labor Act, which provides that labor agreements remain in force until replaced by a successor agreement. Under the Railway Labor Act work stoppages cannot occur until the parties have engaged in substantial negotiations, have mediated any disputes and have received a release from the National Mediation Board.
Salaried employees at our U.S. Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Corporate and Support Services are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Safety
Safety is our primary core value as we continue toward a zero injury culture at all of our facilities.  We continuously monitor, measure and track our safety performance and make frequent improvements to affect change.  Best practices and incident learnings are shared globally to ensure each mine site can effectively administer our policies and procedures for enhanced workplace safety. Progress toward achieving our objectives is accomplished through a focus on proactive initiatives and results measured against established industry and company benchmarks, including our company-wide Total Reportable Incident Rate ("TRIR"). During 2017, our TRIR (including contractors) was 1.32 per 200,000 man-hours worked.  
Refer to Exhibit 95 Mine Safety Disclosures (filed herewith) for mine safety information required in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
