Item 1. Business
Overview
Griffon Corporation (the “Company” or “Griffon”) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company was founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).
Business Strategy
We own and operate, and seek to acquire, businesses in multiple industries and geographic markets. Our objective is to maintain leading positions in the markets we serve by providing innovative, branded products with superior quality and industry-leading service. We place emphasis on our iconic and well-respected brands, which helps to differentiate us and our offerings from our competitors and strengthens our relationship with our customers and those who ultimately use our products.
Through operating a diverse portfolio of businesses, we expect to reduce variability caused by external factors such as market cyclicality, seasonality, and weather. We achieve diversity by providing various product offerings and brands through multiple sales and distribution channels, and conducting business across multiple countries which we consider our home markets. 
Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. As long-term investors, having substantial experience in a variety of industries, our intent is to continue the growth and strengthening of our existing businesses, and to diversify further through investments in our businesses and through acquisitions.
2018 Highlights
On September 5, 2017, Griffon announced the acquisition of ClosetMaid and the commencement of the strategic alternatives process for Clopay Plastic Products, beginning the transformation of Griffon. 
In February 2018, we closed on the sale of our Clopay Plastics business to Berry Global, Inc. ("Berry") for $475 million, thus exiting the specialty plastics industry that the Company had entered when it acquired Clopay Corporation in 1986. This transaction provided immediate liquidity and positions the Company to improve its cash flow conversion given the historically higher capital needs of the Clopay Plastics operations as compared to Griffon’s remaining businesses.
In October 2017, we acquired ClosetMaid from Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) for an effective purchase price of approximately $165 million. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. 
In March 2018, we announced the combination of the ClosetMaid operations with those of AMES. ClosetMaid generated over $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition, and we anticipate the integration with AMES will unlock additional value given the complementary products, customers, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing capabilities of the two businesses.
In June 2018, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. ("CBP") acquired CornellCookson, Inc. ("CornellCookson"), a leading provider of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and grilles, for an effective purchase price of approximately $170 million. This transaction strengthened CBP's strategic portfolio with a line of commercial rolling steel door products to complement the existing CBP sectional door offerings in the commercial industry, and expands the CBP network of professional dealers focused on the commercial market. CornellCookson is expected to contribute approximately $200 million in annual sales to Griffon’s Home and Building Products Segment.
2

During the past two fiscal years Griffon also completed a number of other acquisitions to expand and enhance The AMES Companies' global footprint. In the United Kingdom, Griffon acquired La Hacienda, an outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden décor products, in July 2017, and Kelkay, a manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping, in February 2018. These two businesses provided AMES with a platform for growth in the UK market and give access to leading garden centers, retailers, and grocers in the UK and Ireland.
In Australia, Griffon acquired Hills Home Living, the iconic brand of clotheslines and home products, from Hills Limited (ASX:HIL) in the first quarter of our fiscal 2017. In September 2017, Griffon acquired Tuscan Path, an Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden décor products. These acquisitions broadened AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, strengthening AMES’ market position in Australia and New Zealand.
In November 2017, Griffon acquired Harper Brush Works, a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, from Horizon Global (NYSE:HZN). This acquisition expanded the AMES line of long-handle tools in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning products.
We believe these actions have established a solid foundation for continuing organic growth in sales, profit, and cash generation and bolsters Griffon’s platforms for opportunistic strategic acquisitions.

Reportable Segments:

HOME & BUILDING PRODUCTS

Home & Building Products consists of two companies, AMES and CBP, described below.

AMES
AMES was founded in Massachusetts in 1774, and has the distinction of being one of the oldest companies in continuous operations in the United States. Over its long life, AMES has grown organically and through the acquisition of other leading and historic tool businesses such as True Temper, Union, and Garant. Today, AMES is the leading manufacturer of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals in the United States, and also provides these products in key global markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. With the addition of ClosetMaid, AMES is also the leading provider of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage, and wire garage storage products in the United States. 
Since being acquired by Griffon in 2010, AMES has benefited from strategic acquisitions that have expanded its product portfolio and geographic presence. The ClosetMaid, Southern Patio, and Harper Brush Works acquisitions added to AMES' product categories in North America to include storage and organization, decorative landscaping, and cleaning products. The acquisitions of Northcote, Cyclone, Hills, and Tuscan Path in Australia established AMES as a leading supplier of tools and landscaping categories in the Australian market. As a result of the acquisitions of Kelkay and La Hacienda, the United Kingdom and Ireland has become a new key market for AMES products. 
AMES has approximately 3,600 employees worldwide.

Brands
AMES’ brands are among the most recognized across its primary product categories in North America, Australia and the United Kingdom. Its brand portfolio for long-handled tools and landscaping product includes AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, and Dynamic Design®™. Contractor-oriented tool brands include Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. AMES' closet organization, general living storage, and garage storage products are sold primarily under the ClosetMaid® brand. 
This strong portfolio of brands enables AMES to build and maintain long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In addition, given the breadth of its brand portfolio and product category depth, AMES is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for key retail customers. These strategies have focused on enhancement of brand value, with the goal of de-commoditizing AMES products through the introduction of identity and functionality elements that will make each top brand unique, attractive and visually recognizable by the consumer. The visual brand transformation of the AMES® and Razor-Back® brands was completed in 2015, and the True Temper® line roll-out was completed in 2016. In addition to the brands listed, AMES also sells private label branded products, further differentiating AMES in its customer offerings.
Products

AMES manufactures and markets a broad portfolio of long-handled tools, landscaping products, and organization and storage products. This portfolio contains many iconic brands and is anchored by five core product categories: seasonal outdoor tools, project tools, outdoor décor and watering, storage and organization, and cleaning products. As a result of brand portfolio recognition, high product quality, industry leading service and strong customer relationships, AMES has earned market-leading positions in its five core product categories. The following is a brief description of AMES' primary product lines:

• | Seasonal Outdoor Tools


• | Long Handled Tools: An extensive line of engineered tools including shovels, spades, scoops, rakes, hoes, cultivators, weeders, post hole diggers, scrapers, edgers and forks, marketed under leading brand names including AMES®, True Temper®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Garant®, Cyclone® and Kelso™, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back® Jackson® and Darby™.


• | Wheelbarrows: AMES designs, develops and manufactures a full line of wheelbarrows and lawn carts, primarily under the AMES®, True Temper®, Jackson® Professional Tools, UnionTools®, Garant® and Westmix™ brand names. The

• | Hand Tools: Hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrenches, handsaws, tape measures, levels, clamps, and other traditional hand tools make up this product line. These products are marketed under the Trojan®, Cyclone® and Supercraft® brand names. In addition, gardening hand tools, such as trowels, cultivators, weeders and other specialty garden hand tools, are marketed under the AMES® brand name. 


• | Outdoor Décor and Watering


• | Planters and Lawn Accessories: AMES is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of indoor and outdoor planters and accessories, sold under the Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Tuscan Path, La Hacienda®, Hills®, Kelkay® and Dynamic Design®™ brand names, as well as various private label brands. The range of planter sizes (from 6 to 32 inches) is available in various designs, colors and materials.

• | Storage and Organization: AMES designs, manufactures and sells a comprehensive portfolio of wire and wood shelving, containers, storage cabinets and other closet and home organization accessories primarily under the highly-recognized ClosetMaid® brand name and other private label brands. Wire products include wire shelving and hardware, wire accessories and kitchen storage products. Wire product brands include Maximum Load®, SuperSlide® and ShelfTrack®. Wood solutions include closet systems, cube storage, storage furniture and cabinets. Selected wood product brands include MasterSuite®, Suite Symphony®™, Impressions™, ExpressShelf®, and SpaceCreations®. 


• | Cleaning Products: AMES offers a full line of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, including brooms, brushes, squeegees and other cleaning products, primarily under the Harper® brand. 

Customers
AMES sells products throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe through (1) home centers, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (“Home Depot”), Lowe’s Companies Inc. (“Lowe’s”), Rona Inc., Bunnings Warehouse ("Bunnings") and Woodies (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being approximately 30 years); (2) mass market, specialty, and hardware retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("Walmart"), Target Corporation ("Target"), Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited ("Canadian Tire"), Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco"), Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value Company; (3) industrial distributors, such as W.W. Grainger, Inc. and ORS Nasco, and (4) homebuilders, such as D.R. Horton, KB Home, Lennar and NVR, Inc. 

Home Depot, Lowe's and Bunnings are significant customers of AMES. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the AMES business and on Griffon.

Product Development

AMES product development efforts focus on both new products and product line extensions. AMES continually improves existing products as well as develops new products to satisfy consumer needs, expand revenue opportunities, maintain or extend competitive advantages, increase market share and reduce production costs. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and engineering staffs to introduce new products and product line extensions that are timely and cost effective.

Sales and Marketing

AMES' sales organization is structured by distribution channel in the U.S., and by country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained adjacent to each of the two largest customers’ headquarters, supported by dedicated in-house sales analysts. In addition, sales professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective regions. In Australia, a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for the largest retail customer.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

AMES' primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high density polyethylene), wood (particleboard and hardwoods including ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel (hot rolled, cold rolled, and wire rod). All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. Certain components are purchased, such as heavy forged components and wheelbarrow tires. Most final assembly is completed internally in order to ensure consistent quality. AMES also sources some finished goods. 
Competition

The long-handled tools and landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a single product category. Some competitors, such as Fiskars Corporation in the hand tool and pruning tool market and Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.V. in the long-handled and garden tool space, compete in various tool categories. Suncast Corporation competes in the hose reel and accessory market, and more recently in the long-handled plastic snow shovel category and Swan Hose competes in the garden hose market. In addition, there is competition from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost producing countries, particularly in long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, planters, striking tools and pruning tools.

The home storage and organizational solutions industry is also highly fragmented. AMES, primarily under the ClosetMaid brands, sells through retail, direct to consumer (e-commerce category) and direct to installer (building) channels and competes with a significant number of companies across each of these unique channels. Principal competition for retail wire products is from Newell Brands, Inc. through their Rubbermaid® product line. FirstService Brands, Inc. sells competing wood solutions under the brand California Closets®, but does not sell through the retail or direct to consumer channels. We believe that AMES' market share in the U.S. is approximately double that of its largest competitors in the home storage and organizational solutions product category. 
AMES differentiates itself and provides the best value to customers through its successful history of innovation, dependable supply chain and high on-time delivery rates, quality, product performance, and highly recognized product brands. AMES' size, depth and breadth of product offering, category knowledge, research and development (“R&D”) investment, service and its ability to react to sudden changes in demand from seasonal weather patterns, especially during harsh winter months, are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack sufficient product innovation, capacity, proximity to market and distribution capabilities to service large retailers or to compete in highly seasonal, weather related product categories.
Manufacturing & Distribution

AMES has a combination of internal and external, and domestic and foreign manufacturing sources from which it sources products for sale in the markets it serves. Principal manufacturing facilities include 644,000 square feet of manufacturing operations in Harrisburg and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a 640,000 square foot facility in Ocala, Florida, and a 353,000 square foot manufacturing center in St. Francois, Quebec, Canada. AMES operates smaller manufacturing facilities at several other locations in the United States, and internationally in Reynosa, Mexico; Jiangmen, China; and Grafton, New South Wales and Wonthaggi, Victoria, both in Australia. 
AMES has two principal distribution facilities in the United States, a 1.2 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and a 400,000 square foot facility in Reno, Nevada. Finished goods are transported to these facilities from AMES' manufacturing sites by both an internal fleet, as well as over the road trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle and Reno locations. Smaller distribution centers are also strategically located in the U.S. in Ocala, Florida, Chino, California, Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania and Pharr, Texas, and internationally in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland. 

In January 2013, AMES undertook to close certain of its U.S. manufacturing facilities and consolidate affected operations primarily into its Camp Hill and Carlisle, PA locations. The actions, completed at the end of the 2015 first quarter, improved manufacturing 
6

and distribution efficiencies, allowed for in-sourcing of certain production previously performed by third party suppliers, and improved material flow and absorption of fixed costs. This initiative resulted in annual cash savings exceeding $10,000. Realization of savings began in 2015. 
Clopay Building Products

Founded in 1964 and acquired by us in 1986, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc., or CBP, has grown organically and through acquisitions to become the leading manufacturer and marketer of residential sectional garage doors, and among the largest manufacturers of commercial sectional doors, rolling steel doors, and grille products, in the United States. CBP also manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of CBP’s sales come from home remodeling and renovation projects, with the balance from new residential housing construction and commercial building markets. Sales into the home remodeling market are driven by the aging of the housing stock, existing home sales activity, and the trends of improving both home appearance and energy efficiency. CBP has approximately 2,600 employees.

On June 4, 2018, CBP acquired CornellCookson, a leading U.S. manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180 million, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account estimated tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price was $170 million, subject to certain adjustments. CornellCookson was founded in 1828 as Cornell Iron Works and, in 2008, purchased the Cookson Company, which was founded in 1938, to form CornellCookson. The acquisition of CornellCookson expands CBP’s existing footprint in the commercial door market and strengthens relationships with professional dealers and installers. CBP had previously partnered with CornellCookson on customer solutions for over eight years. Consolidating the companies allows CBP to broaden its existing portfolio of brands, products and customers to serve the commercial market more efficiently with multiple types of doors, and creates additional opportunity to expand our position in adjacent markets. Similar distribution and product composition between the businesses also allows for potential cost savings opportunities across distribution networks and through commodity purchasing.
Brands

CBP brings over 50 years of experience and innovation to the residential and sectional garage door industry. Our market-leading brands include Clopay®, America’s Favorite Garage Doors®, Holmes Garage Door Company® and IDEAL Door®, as well as the newly acquired Cornell® and Cookson® commercial door brands. 
Products and Service

CBP manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety of options, at varying prices. CBP offers garage doors made primarily from steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as garage door openers manufactured by third parties. CBP also offers a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles.

Commercial door products manufactured and marketed by CBP include rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and shutters, steel security grilles, and room dividers. CBP also manufactures and markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance specifications of a commercial application.

Customers

CBP is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on CBP’s and Griffon’s business. CBP distributes its garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and through its distribution centers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These distribution centers allow CBP to maintain an inventory of garage doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and professional dealer customers.
Product Development

CBP product development efforts focus on both new products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through in-house design and engineering staffs.

CBP operates technical development centers where its research engineers design and develop new products and technologies and perform durability and performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. CBP continually improves its door offerings through these development efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design, operating performance and 
7

durability, and energy efficiency. The process engineering teams also work to develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products.

Sales and Marketing

The CBP sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new product development and aggressively markets door solutions, with a primary focus on the North American market. CBP maintains a strong promotional presence, in both traditional and digital media. 
CBP customers utilize a proprietary residential door web application, the MyDoor® mobile enabled app, that guides consumers through an easy to use visualization and pricing program, allowing them to select the optimal door for their home. For CBP's commercial products, Clopay's Commercial Door Quoter (CDQ™) and CornellCookson's WebGen systems are available to assist our professional dealers streamline their quoting and submittal process for greater productivity and backroom efficiency improvement. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw material used in CBP’s manufacturing is galvanized steel. CBP also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources.
Competition

The sectional garage door and commercial rolling steel door industry includes several large national manufacturers and many smaller, regional and local manufacturers. CBP competes on the basis of service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design.

CBP’s brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. CBP believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers and retailers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors with industry leading lead times. CBP’s market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing its market share.

Manufacturing

In 2016 CBP completed a 250,000 square foot expansion of its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. This expansion reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and CBP's success in bringing new technologies to market. The Troy facility now has 1.23 million square feet of combined manufacturing and office space. A 184,000 square foot facility in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania and a 163,000 square foot facility in Goodyear, Arizona provide manufacturing primarily for rolling steel products. CBP’s Russia, Ohio facility provides additional production capacity, particularly for specialized and custom products.
Distribution

CBP distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels, including a national network of 51 distribution centers. Additionally, products are sold to over 2,500 independent professional installing dealers and to major home center retail chains including Home Depot and Menards (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 25 years). CBP maintains strong relationships with its installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of residential garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North America and the largest supplier of rolling steel door products in North America.
DEFENSE ELECTRONICS

The U.S. defense budget for government fiscal year (GFY) 2019 is set at $686 billion with the President's first full defense budget request including major growth to most mission areas. This represents a $73 billion, or 12% increase over the prior year defense budget of $613 billion. Budgets through GFY 2023 increase with a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of approximately 2% over the GFY 2019 baseline budget level. 
Internationally, demand is growing due to major system capability upgrades in existing systems and re-capitalization of aging assets. We anticipate global defense spending to grow with a CAGR of about 3% over the 2018-2022 period. The U.S. is the largest exporter of defense equipment in the world, and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future with significant increases in defense budgets expected in countries that have historically imported defense products from the U.S. such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkey, Taiwan, Australia, India, South Korea and Japan, among others. 
Domestic and international defense market trends bode well for business opportunities for Telephonics products supporting Imaging and Surveillance Radar Systems, Communications, Surveillance and Border Surveillance.
Telephonics is organized into five primary business lines: Radar, Surveillance, Communications, Systems Engineering and Analysis (SEG), and Telephonics Large Scale Integration. 

• | Radar: Telephonics provides a wide range of high-performing, lightweight and cost-effective maritime surveillance and weather avoidance radar systems for fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and shipboard platforms to the U.S. Government and numerous international defense agencies. Telephonics maritime surveillance radars offer advanced features such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and weather avoidance. 


• | Surveillance: Telephonics is a global leader in Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radars (MSSR) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems enabling military and civilian air traffic controllers to effectively identify aircraft and vehicles as friendly. Telephonics provides both equipment and supporting services required to safely and reliably control flight operations. These systems are used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marines, Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), NATO and numerous international defense agencies. They have been fielded globally in a wide range of ground, air and sea-based applications.


• | Communications: Telephonics' advanced wired and wireless communication systems provide the digital backbone for defense and civil platforms worldwide, including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, lighter-than-air aircraft and ground control shelters. These systems are designed to meet stringent customer requirements to support adaptability to special missions and communications protocol requirements. Telephonics' vehicle-based intercommunications systems deliver traditional intercom system capabilities while incorporating software-defined features, including an open architecture for integration into vehicle C4 (command, control, communications, and computing) systems, networked communications gateways and combat vehicles. Commercial audio products and headsets are utilized worldwide in a wide range of military and civilian applications, including audiometric testing and onboard flight entertainment. Advanced transit communications systems deliver high-quality audio communications and critical travel information, enhancing passenger safety, as well as train crew intelligibility and operational efficiency. Telephonics communications systems are fielded within the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marines and numerous international defense agencies. These systems are also sold to aerospace manufacturers, commercial airlines, and audiometric original equipment manufacturers. 


• | Systems Engineering and Analysis (SEG): SEG provides sophisticated, highly technical engineering and analytic support to customers including the Missile Defense Agency, AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense Program, Program Executive Offices for Integrated Warfare Systems and Ships, U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Centers, Marine Corps System Command and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, among others. As a leading provider of combat, radar and missile systems engineering and analysis, SEG is a key source of systems engineering expertise for the U.S. integrated air and missile defense initiatives. In addition to government program offices, SEG works extensively with national laboratories, the Intelligence Community and prime contractors. 


• | Telephonics Large Scale Integration (TLSI): TLSI has designed nearly 400 mixed-signal custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for customers in the automotive, industrial, defense/avionics and smart energy markets. TLSI works with its customers' technical teams, taking complete responsibility for the ASIC development process, from the initial ASIC specification definition through qualification and volume production, to meet the most stringent customer program requirements. Over 10 million ASIC's are shipped every year. 

To meet the unique challenges of operating in an increasingly complex industry that is faced with continued economic and budgetary pressure on U.S. defense procurement, Telephonics has adapted its core surveillance and communications products, typically used 
9

by the U.S. government and its agencies, to meet the needs of international customers in both defense and commercial markets. Telephonics' two largest product lines include maritime surveillance radar and aircraft intercommunication management systems and as Telephonics continues to concentrate on adjacent markets to grow these product lines both domestically and internationally, the company remains focused on delivering high-quality products and services that protect military personnel and civilian interests world-wide.
Telephonics’ leading-edge products and services are well-positioned to address the needs of a fully integrated and modernized battlefield with an emphasis on providing complete situational awareness to the warfighter whether on the ground, in the air or at sea, providing timely, secure and accurate intelligence. Telephonics anticipates that the need for secure, integrated surveillance and communications capabilities will continue to increase as the U.S. and foreign militaries expand their role in fighting terrorism both at home and abroad. Telephonics has also invested in design and development of technologies focused on advanced intelligence and surveillance sensors with applications in both manned and unmanned systems, as well as border and perimeter security markets. 

Telephonics is a partner in Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems, a Joint Venture (JV) with Mahindra Defense Systems in India. The business is focused on providing the Indian defense and civil sectors with surveillance, communications and IFF systems. The JV also intends to provide ATM, border and perimeter security and other surveillance technologies to meet emerging demands.
Programs and Products

Based on long-established relationships supported by existing contractual arrangements, Telephonics is a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin", which includes Sikorsky Aircraft), The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman"), Oshkosh Corporation ("Oshkosh"), Airbus Military, Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo (Agusta Westland) Helicopters, and SAAB, (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 20 years), and is a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense and FAA. The significance of each of these customers to Telephonics’ revenue fluctuates on an annual basis, based on the timing and funding of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) contract award, and the technological scope of the work required. Key products include maritime radars, identification friend or foe systems, mobile surveillance and communication systems. The significant contraction and consolidation in the U.S. and international defense industry provides opportunities for established first-tier suppliers to capitalize on existing relationships with major prime contractors and to play a larger role in defense systems development and procurement for the foreseeable future.
Recently, Telephonics successfully leveraged its core Surveillance technologies to develop a solution, now fielded by the FAA as a part of the Common Terminal Digitizer (CTD) program, at numerous air surveillance radar sites across the United States. Telephonics expects to continue to leverage its technology to improve the value proposition offered to future FAA radar infrastructure upgrade programs.

Telephonics continues to direct resources towards border surveillance and critical infrastructure security initiatives. These opportunities represent strategic advances for Telephonics by enabling it to expand its core technical expertise into the nascent and growing border and perimeter security markets, both in the U.S. and abroad. With many of these programs, system specifications and operational and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by demanding delivery schedules. Telephonics believes that the technological capabilities these systems encompass will also be able to serve and protect the most complex borders.

Backlog
The funded backlog for Telephonics approximated $344,900 at September 30, 2018, compared to $350,900 at September 30, 2017. Approximately 69% of the current backlog is expected to be filled during 2019.
Backlog represents the dollar value of funded orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and converts into revenue as we incur costs related to contractual commitments or the shipment of product. The decrease in backlog was primarily attributed to the timing of various international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities that were not received by the end of the reporting period. Given the nature of our business and a larger dependency on international customers, our bookings, and therefore our backlog, is impacted by the longer maturation cycles resulting in delays in the timing and amounts of such awards, which are subject to numerous factors, including fiscal constraints placed on customer budgets; political uncertainty; the timing of customer negotiations; and the timing of governmental approvals.

Customers

The U.S. Government, through prime contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Oshkosh, is a significant customer of Telephonics. The loss of the U.S. Government or any of its prime contractors as a customer could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ business. Notwithstanding the significance of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, Telephonics sells to a diverse group of other domestic and international defense industry contractors, as well as others who use Telephonics products for commercial use.

Telephonics participates in a range of long-term defense and non-military government programs, both in the U.S. and internationally. Telephonics has developed a base of installed products that generate significant recurring revenue from product enhancements and retrofits, as well as providing spare parts and customer support. Due to the inherent complexity of these electronic systems, Telephonics believes that its incumbent status on major platforms provides a competitive advantage in the selection process for platform upgrades and enhancements. Furthermore, Telephonics believes that its ability to leverage and apply its advanced technology to new platforms provides a competitive advantage when bidding for new business.

Research and Development ("R&D")

In order to continue to offer affordable and technologically advanced solutions that provide relevant and required features, Telephonics works closely with prime customers to ensure that there is a future market for its products by investing R&D funds in desired enhancements. Telephonics continually updates its core technologies through internally funded R&D while coordinating with customers at the earliest stages of new program development in an effort to provide solutions well in advance of its competitors. Internally funded R&D costs include basic and applied research initiatives, development activities, and other conceptual formulation studies. Telephonics is a technological leader in its core markets and pursues new growth opportunities by leveraging its systems design and engineering capabilities, and incumbent position, on key platforms.

In addition to products for defense programs, Telephonics' technology is also used in commercial applications such as airborne weather, search and rescue radar, and air traffic management systems. Telephonics’ reputation for innovative product design and engineering capabilities, especially in the areas of voice and data communications, radio frequency design, digital signal processing, networking systems, inverse synthetic aperture radar and analog, and digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, will continue to enhance its ability to secure, retain and expand its participation in defense programs and commercial opportunities.

Telephonics often designs its products to exceed customers’ minimum specifications, providing its customers with greater performance, flexibility, and value. Telephonics believes that early participation and communication with its customers in the requirements definition stages of new program development increases the likelihood that its products will be selected and integrated as part of a total system solution.
Telephonics is currently investing in an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) based radar solution to address emerging requirements in the maritime and overland radar markets. Continued investments in the Surveillance product portfolio are expected to result in market penetration opportunities in the ground tactical markets with small form factor passive and active IFF solutions. In addition, development of SkySearch-2020, a next generation Mode S Beacon system, is expected to enable Telephonics to continue pursuing FAA opportunities that align with its core competencies and technologies. Investments in the Communications Systems business line are focused on supporting pilot effectiveness initiatives by addressing cognitive overload conditions through innovative adaptive aural processing algorithms. 
Sales and Marketing

Telephonics has technical business development personnel who act as the focal point for its marketing activities and sales representatives who introduce its products and systems to customers worldwide.
Competition

Telephonics competes with major manufacturers of electronic information and communication systems, as well as several smaller manufacturers of similar products. Telephonics endeavors to design high quality and reliable products with greater performance and flexibility than its competitors while competing on the basis of technology, innovative solutions, and price.

Clopay Plastic Products - Discontinued Operations
On November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Clopay Plastics business and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the Clopay Plastics business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude Clopay Plastics unless otherwise noted. Clopay Plastics is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.
Griffon Corporation

Employees

As of September 30, 2018, Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 7,200 people located primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and China. Approximately 200 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S., with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), and the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union. Additionally, approximately 200 employees in Canada are represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory. 
Generally, the total number of employees of Griffon and its subsidiaries does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches or lines of business may increase the number of employees or fluctuations in the level of Griffon's business activity, which could in turn require staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.
Regulation

Griffon’s operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental laws has not materially affected, and is not expected to materially affect, Griffon’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.

Telephonics, which sells directly and indirectly to the U.S. government, is subject to certain regulations, laws and standards set by the U.S. government. Additionally, Telephonics is subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, and other Inspectors General. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems.
Customers

A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon’s consolidated revenue from continuing operations. In 2018:

a. | The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 10% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue and 62% of Telephonics' revenue.
b. | Home Depot represented 19% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue. 


12

No other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers and Griffon's relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s financial results, liquidity and operations.
Seasonality

Griffon’s HBP revenue and income are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business. In 2018, 55% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 55% in 2017 and 56% in 2016. CBP’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter. Defense Electronics revenue is generally driven by delivery requirement of its customers, however, often Defense Electronics will have increased revenue in the latter half of the year due to U.S. government's annual budget cycle.
Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during peak gardening season. AMES' sales volume can be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.

Griffon’s non-U.S. businesses are primarily in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China.

Research and Development

Griffon’s businesses are encouraged to improve existing products as well as develop new products to satisfy customer needs; expand revenue opportunities; maintain or extend competitive advantages; increase market share and reduce production costs. R&D costs, not recoverable under contractual arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred. R&D costs for Griffon were $15,400 in 2018, $17,700 in 2017 and $18,000 in 2016.
Intellectual Property

Griffon follows a practice of actively protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the world where Griffon’s products are sold. All intellectual property information presented in this section is as of September 30, 2018.
Trademarks are of significant importance to Griffon’s HBP business. With 50 years of experience and innovation in the garage door industry, CBP has a significant level of goodwill in its strong family of brands, including: Clopay®, America’s Favorite Garage Doors®; Holmes Garage Door Company® and IDEAL Door®, as well as the newly acquired Cornell® and Cookson® commercial door brands. Principal global and regional trademarks used by AMES for its tool and landscape products include AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, and Dynamic Design®, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. Storage and innovation brands within AMES include ClosetMaid, MasterSuite®, Suite Symphony™, Impressions™, ExpressShelf®, SpaceCreations®, Maximum Load®, SuperSlide® and ShelfTrack®. The HBP business has approximately 1,126 registered trademarks and approximately 171 pending trademark applications around the world. Griffon’s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered.
Patents are also important to the HBP business. CBP holds 39 issued patents and 10 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as 15 and 5 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, primarily related to garage door system components and operation. AMES protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents, and currently has 351 issued patents and 31 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as 219 and 31 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, respectively. 
13

Design patents are generally valid for fourteen years, and utility patents are generally valid for twenty years, from the date of filing. Griffon's patents are in various stages of their terms of validity.
In the government and defense business, formal intellectual property rights are of limited value. Therefore, the Telephonics business tends to hold most of its important intellectual property as trade secrets, which it protects through the use of contract terms and carefully restricting access to its technology.
