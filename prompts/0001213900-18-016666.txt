ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Research and Development
 
We are a pharmaceutical company currently engaged in the research and development of innovative pharmaceutical solutions, including an oral insulin capsule to be used for the treatment of individuals with diabetes, and the use of orally ingestible capsules or pills for delivery of other polypeptides.
 
Oral insulin: We are seeking to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes through our proprietary flagship product, an orally ingestible insulin capsule, or ORMD-0801. Our technology allows insulin to travel from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein to the bloodstream, revolutionizing the manner in which insulin is delivered. It enables its passage in a more physiological manner than current delivery methods of insulin. Our technology is a platform that has the potential to deliver medications and vaccines orally that today can only be delivered via injection.
 
In April 2018, we initiated a three-month dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of ORMD-0801. This placebo controlled, randomized, 90 day treatment clinical trial is being conducted on approximately 285 type 2 diabetic patients in multiple centers throughout the United States pursuant to an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The primary endpoints of the trial are to assess the safety and evaluate the effect of ORMD-0801 on HbA1c levels over a 90 day treatment period. Secondary endpoints of the trial include measurements of fasting plasma glucose, or FPG, post-prandial glucose, or PPG levels, during a mixed-meal tolerance test, or MMTT, and weight.
 
We had a call with the FDA in August 2017 regarding ORMD-0801 after the completion of a Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 diabetic patients, which indicated a statistically significant blood glucose lowering effect of ORMD-0801 versus placebo across several endpoints. During the call, the FDA advised that the regulatory pathway for the submission of ORMD-0801 would be a Biologics License Application, or BLA. If approved, the BLA pathway would grant us 12 years of marketing exclusivity for ORMD-0801, from the approval date, and an additional six months of exclusivity may be granted to us if the product also receives approval for use in pediatric patients. The FDA confirmed that the approach to nonclinical toxicology, chemistry manufacturing controls and qualification of excipients would be driven by their published guidance documents.
 
In June 2018, we initiated a glucose clamp study which will quantify insulin absorption in type 1 diabetic patients treated with ORMD-0801. The glucose clamp is a method for quantifying insulin absorption in order to measure a patient’s insulin sensitivity and how well a patient metabolizes glucose. This exploratory, randomized, double-blind glucose clamp study is evaluating exposure-response profiles of type 1 diabetic patients treated with ORMD-0801. Six patients with HbA1c levels of 10% or below, aged 18-50, are enrolled in the study.
 
In June 2018, we also initiated a food effect trial in the United States for ORMD-0801. This single-blind, five period, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial is evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ORMD-0801 taken at different times in relation to meals in healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes. Up to 48 patients will be enrolled, including up to 24 healthy volunteers and 24 patients with type 1 diabetes.
 
In October 2018, we initiated an exploratory clinical study of ORMD-0801, in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. The three-month treatment study, which was approved by the Israel’s Ministry of Health, will assess the effectiveness of ORMD-0801 in reducing liver fat content, inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NASH.
 
Oral Glucagon-Like Peptide-1: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1, or GLP-1, is an incretin hormone, which is a type of gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The incretin concept was hypothesized when it was noted that glucose ingested by mouth (oral) stimulated two to three times more insulin release than the same amount of glucose administered intravenously. In addition to stimulating insulin release, GLP-1 was found to suppress glucagon release (a hormone involved in the regulation of glucose) from the pancreas, slow gastric emptying to reduce the rate of absorption of nutrients into the blood stream and increase satiety. Other important beneficial attributes of GLP-1 are its effects of increasing the number of beta cells (cells that manufacture and release insulin) in the pancreas and, possibly, protection of the heart. In addition to our flagship product, the ORMD-0801 insulin capsule, we are using our technology for an orally ingestible GLP-1 capsule, or ORMD-0901. In September 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for human trials of ORMD-0901. We expect to initiate in the first quarter of calendar year 2019 a Phase I pharmacokinetic, or PK, trial which will evaluate the safety and the pharmacokinetics of ORMD-0901 compared to placebo. This study will be conducted pursuant to the IND and will be followed by a large Phase II trial on type 2 diabetic patients which will be conducted in the United States under an IND.

Diabetes: Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. Insulin is a hormone that causes sugar to be absorbed into cells, where the sugar is converted into energy needed for daily life. The cause of diabetes is attributed both to genetics (type 1 diabetes) and, most often, to environmental factors such as obesity and lack of exercise (type 2 diabetes). According to the International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, an estimated 425 million adults worldwide suffered from diabetes in 2017 and the IDF projects this number will increase to 629 million by 2045. Also, according to the IDF, in 2017, an estimated 4 million people died from diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, in the United States there were approximately 30.3 million people with diabetes, or 9.4% of the United States population in 2015. Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and amputation.
 
Intellectual property: We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering our technologies, and we are aggressively protecting these technology developments on a worldwide basis.
 
Management: We are led by a highly-experienced management team knowledgeable in the treatment of diabetes. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Miriam Kidron, PhD, is a world-recognized pharmacologist and a biochemist and the innovator primarily responsible for our oral insulin technology development and know-how.
 
Scientific Advisory Board: Our management team has access to our internationally recognized Scientific Advisory Board whose members are thought-leaders in their respective areas. The Scientific Advisory Board is comprised of Dr. Roy Eldor, Professor Ele Ferrannini, Dr. Robert R. Henry, Professor Avram Hershko, Dr. Harold Jacob and Dr. Jane E. B. Reusch.
 
Strategy
 
Short Term Business Strategy
 
We plan to conduct further research and development on the technology covered by the patent application “Methods and Composition for Oral Administration of Proteins,” which we acquired from Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. in 2006, and which is granted in various foreign jurisdictions, as well as the other patents we have filed in various foreign jurisdictions since then, as discussed below under “—Patents and Licenses” and below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.
 
Through our research and development efforts, we have successfully developed an oral dosage form that will withstand the harsh environment of the stomach and intestines and will be effective in delivering active insulin or other proteins, such as exenatide, for the treatment of diabetes. The excipients that are added to the proteins in the formulation process must not modify the proteins chemically or biologically, and the dosage form must be safe to ingest. We plan to continue to conduct clinical trials to show the effectiveness of our technology.
 
As noted above, in April 2018, we initiated a three-month dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of ORMD-0801 and in August 2017, we had a call with the FDA regarding ORMD-0801, during which the FDA advised that the regulatory pathway for the submission of ORMD-0801 would be a BLA.

In April 2016 we completed a smaller Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 type 2 adult diabetic patients. This double-blind, randomized, 28-day dosing clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0801, and was conducted in 33 sites in the United States. The trial indicated a statistically significant lowering of blood glucose levels versus placebo across several endpoints, with no serious or severe adverse issues related to the drug. The trial successfully met all of its primary and most of its secondary and exploratory endpoints. The trial primarily evaluated the nighttime glucose lowering effect and safety of ORMD-0801 compared to a placebo. The results of the mean nighttime glucose showed a significant difference in mean change from run-in versus placebo. ORMD-0801 oral insulin was safe and well-tolerated for the dosing regimen in this trial. The trial further evaluated the effect of ORMD-0801 on mean 24-hour glucose, fasting glucose, and daytime glucose and the results showed a statistically significant difference in mean change from run-in versus placebo. Two examples of the data gleaned from this study are shown below:
 

* Indicates Statistically Significant Difference from Placebo (p-Value<0.05)
 
No significant difference was shown in change in morning fasting serum insulin, C-Peptide, or triglycerides.
 
Should our Phase IIb three-month dose-ranging clinical trial successfully meet its primary endpoints, we anticipate initiating two six-month Phase III clinical trials on both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, following which we expect to file a NDA with potential FDA approval by the second half of calendar year 2023.
 
As noted above, in September 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for human trials of our oral GLP-1 analog capsule ORMD-0901 and we expect to initiate in the first quarter of calendar year 2019 a Phase I PK trial which will evaluate the safety and the pharmacokinetics of ORMD-0901 compared to placebo.
 
Clinical trials are planned in order to substantiate our results as well as for purposes of making future filings for drug approval. We also plan to conduct further research and development by deploying our proprietary drug delivery technology for the delivery of other polypeptides in addition to insulin, and to develop other innovative pharmaceutical products.
 
The table below gives an overview of our primary product pipeline (calendar quarters):
 

 | | Phase I | Phase II | Phase III | Timeline
-------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------

Another component of our business strategy is to partner with other companies or medical institutions in order to further develop our technology and commence pre-commercialization activities. On November 30, 2015, we, our Israeli subsidiary and HTIT entered into a Technology License Agreement, which was further amended, according to which we granted HTIT an exclusive commercialization license in the territory of the People’s Republic of China, Macau and Hong Kong, or the Territory, related to our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801. Pursuant to this license agreement, HTIT will conduct, at its own expense, certain pre-commercialization and regulatory activities with respect to our subsidiary’s technology related to the ORMD-0801 capsule, and will pay, upon the meeting of certain conditions, certain royalties and an aggregate of approximately $37.5 million (see “Out-Licensed Technology” below). We plan to seek additional partnerships or forms of cooperation with other companies or medical institutions. While our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that we will in fact be able to reach an agreeable partnership with any third party. Under certain circumstances, we may determine to develop one or more of our oral dosage forms on our own, either world-wide or in select territories.
 
Long Term Business Strategy
 
If our oral insulin capsule or other drug delivery solutions show significant promise in clinical trials, we plan to ultimately seek a strategic commercial partner, or partners, with extensive experience in the development, commercialization, and marketing of insulin applications and/or other orally digestible drugs. We anticipate such partner or partners would be responsible for, or substantially support, late stage clinical trials (Phase III) to increase the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals and registrations in the appropriate markets in a timely manner. We further anticipate that such partner, or partners, would also be responsible for sales, marketing and support of our oral insulin capsule in these markets. Such planned strategic partnership, or partnerships, may provide a marketing and sales infrastructure for our products as well as financial and operational support for global clinical trials, post marketing studies, label expansions and other regulatory requirements concerning future clinical development in the United States and elsewhere. Any future strategic partner, or partners, may also provide capital and expertise that would enable the partnership to develop new oral dosage forms for other polypeptides. While our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that we will in fact be able to reach an agreeable partnership with any third party. Under certain circumstances, we may determine to develop one or more of our oral dosage forms on our own, either world-wide or in select territories.
Other Planned Strategic Activities
 
In addition to developing our own oral dosage form drug portfolio, we are, on an on-going basis, considering in-licensing and other means of obtaining additional technologies to complement and/or expand our current product portfolio. Our goal is to create a well-balanced product portfolio that will enhance and complement our existing drug portfolio.
Product Development
 
Research and Development Summary
 
We devote the majority of our efforts to research and development, including clinical studies for our lead clinical product candidates, as described below.

Oral Insulin
 
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, we conducted several clinical studies of our orally ingestible insulin that were intended to assess both the safety/tolerability and absorption properties of our proprietary oral insulin. Based on the PK and pharmacologic outcomes of these trials, we decided to continue the development of our oral insulin product.
 
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008, we successfully completed animal studies and non-FDA approved clinical trials using our oral insulin capsule, including a Phase Ib clinical trial in healthy human volunteers with the intent of dose optimization; a Phase IIa study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule in type 2 diabetic volunteers at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem; and a Phase IIa study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule on type 1 diabetic volunteers.
 
Our successful non-FDA clinical trials continued in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, with a Phase IIb study in South Africa to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our oral insulin capsule on type 2 diabetic volunteers.
 
In September 2010, we reported the successful results of an exploratory clinical trial testing the effectiveness of our oral insulin capsule in type 1 diabetes patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes. Unstable or labile diabetes is characterized by recurrent, unpredictable and dramatic blood glucose swings often linked with irregular hyperglycemia and sometimes serious hypoglycemia affecting type 1 diabetes patients. This successfully completed exploratory study was a proof of concept study for defining a novel indication for ORMD-0801. We believe the encouraging results justify further clinical development of ORMD-0801 capsule application toward management of uncontrolled diabetes.
 
In March 2011, we reported that we successfully completed a comprehensive toxicity study for our oral insulin capsule. The study was completed under conditions prescribed by the FDA Good Laboratory Practices regulations.
 
We originally filed an IND with the FDA in December 2012 for clearance to begin a Phase II clinical trial of our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy in type 2 diabetic volunteers. Because the identical formulation of ORMD-0801 had not yet been studied in humans at bedtime, in February 2013, the FDA noted concerns about mitigating potential risks of severe hypoglycemia and requested that we perform a sub-study in a controlled in-patient setting for a one-week period prior to beginning the larger multi-centered Phase II trial. As a result, we withdrew the original IND and, in April 2013, we submitted a new IND for the Phase IIa study.
 
We began FDA-approved clinical trials of ORMD-0801 in July 2013, with the Phase IIa study, which evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of ORMD-0801 on mean nighttime glucose (determined using a continuous glucose monitor) on 30 volunteers with type 2 diabetes. The Phase IIa study met all primary and secondary endpoints. The results showed that ORMD-0801 exhibited a sound safety profile, led to reduced mean daytime and nighttime glucose readings and lowered fasting blood glucose concentrations, when compared to placebo. In addition, no serious adverse events occurred during this study, and the only adverse events that occurred were not drug related.
 
In February 2014, we submitted a protocol to the FDA to initiate a Phase IIa trial of our oral insulin capsule for type 1 diabetes volunteers. The protocol was submitted under our then-existing IND to include both type 1 and type 2 diabetes indications. In March 2014, we began a seven-day treatment in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, FDA-approved Phase IIa trial of ORMD-0801 on 25 volunteers with type 1 diabetes. The results showed that ORMD-0801 oral insulin given before meals appeared to be safe and well-tolerated for the dosing regimen in this study. Although the study was not powered to show statistical significance, there were internally consistent trends observed. Consistent with the timing of administration, the data showed a decrease in bolus insulin, a decrease in post-prandial glucose, a decrease in daytime glucose by continual glucose monitoring and an increase in post-prandial hypoglycemia in the active group, demonstrating the efficacy of ORMD-0801.
 
In June 2015, we initiated a Phase IIb clinical trial on 180 type 2 adult diabetic patients, which was completed in April 2016. This double-blind, randomized, 28-day treatment period clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0801 and was conducted in 33 sites in the United States. The trial indicated a statistically significant lowering of blood glucose levels versus placebo across several endpoints, with no serious or severe adverse issues related to the drug. The trial successfully met all of its primary and most of its secondary and exploratory endpoints for both safety and efficacy.

In October 2016, we initiated an additional Phase IIa, dose finding clinical trial which was completed in February 2017. This randomized, double-blind trial was conducted on 32 type 2 adult diabetic patients in order to better define the optimal dosing of ORMD-0801 moving forward. The results of the trial indicated a positive safety profile and potentially meaningful efficacy of ORMD-0801, as the efficacy data suggest ORMD-0801 improves glucose control.
 
In March 2017, we initiated a six-month toxicology study to allow for the use of our oral insulin capsule for a longer period than previously performed. We anticipate receiving the final report of this study in the first quarter of calendar year 2019.
 
In August 2017, we had a call with the FDA regarding ORMD-0801. During the call, the FDA advised that the regulatory pathway for the submission of ORMD-0801 would be a BLA. If approved, the BLA pathway would grant us 12 years of marketing exclusivity for ORMD-0801, from the approval date, and an additional six months of exclusivity may be granted if the product also receives approval for use in pediatric patients. The FDA confirmed that the approach to nonclinical toxicology, chemistry manufacturing controls and qualification of excipients would be driven by their published guidance documents.
 
In April 2018, we initiated a three-month dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of ORMD-0801. This placebo controlled, randomized, 90 day treatment clinical trial is being conducted on approximately 285 type 2 diabetic patients in multiple centers throughout the U.S. pursuant to an IND. The primary endpoints of the trial are to assess the safety and evaluate the effect of ORMD-0801 on HbA1c levels over a 90 day treatment period. Secondary endpoints of the trial include measurements of FPG, PPG levels during a MMTT and weight.
 
As noted above, in June 2018, we initiated a glucose clamp study which will quantify insulin absorption in type 1 diabetic patients treated with ORMD-0801.
 
As noted above, in June 2018, we also initiated a food effect trial in the United States for ORMD-0801.
 
We utilize Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical studies.
 
Oral GLP-1 Analog
 
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, we completed pre-clinical trials of ORMD-0901, an analog for GLP-1, which suggested that the GLP-1 analog (exenatide-4), when combined with our capsule technology, is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and retains its biological activity.
 
In December 2009, we completed a non-FDA approved clinical trial in healthy, male volunteers conducted at Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ORMD-0901. The results of the study indicated that ORMD-0901 was well tolerated by all subjects and demonstrated physiological activity, as extrapolated from ensuing subject insulin levels when compared to those observed after treatment with placebo.
 
In January 2013, we began a clinical trial for our oral exenatide capsule on healthy volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Based on this study, we decided to make slight adjustments in the manufacturing of these capsules and began pre-toxicology studies on the new capsules.
 
In September 2013, we submitted a pre-IND package to the FDA for ORMD-0901.
 
In August 2015, we began a non-FDA clinical trial outside of the United States for ORMD-0901 on type 2 diabetic patients. The trial was completed during the second quarter of calendar year 2016 and indicated positive results as it showed ORMD-0901 to be safe and well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging efficacy data.
 
We completed a three-month pre-clinical toxicology study in March 2017 and submitted the report relating to this study to the FDA with our IND.

In September 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for human trials of ORMD-0901. We expect to initiate in the first quarter of calendar year 2019 a Phase I PK trial which will evaluate the safety and the pharmacokinetics of ORMD-0901 compared to placebo. This fully-randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled four-way crossover study will be conducted on up to 15 healthy patients pursuant to the IND and will be followed by a large Phase II trial on type 2 diabetic patients which will be conducted in the United States under an IND. 
 
Combination Therapy
 
In June 2012, we presented an abstract, which reported the impact of ORMD-0801 delivered in combination with ORMD-0901. The work assessed the safety and effectiveness of a combination of oral insulin and oral exenatide treatments delivered to pigs prior to food intake. The drug combination resulted in significantly improved blood glucose regulation when compared to administration of each drug separately.
 
In the near term, we are focusing our efforts on the development of our flagship products, oral insulin and oral exenatide. Once these two products have progressed further in clinical trials, we intend to conduct additional studies with the oral combination therapy.
 
Other products
 
During the first quarter of calendar year 2017, we began developing a new drug candidate, a weight loss treatment in the form of an oral leptin capsule, and in April 2017, Israel’s Ministry of Health approved our commencement of a proof of concept single dose study for our oral leptin drug candidate to evaluate its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (glucagon reduction) in 10 type 1 adult diabetic patients. The study is projected to be initiated in calendar year 2019 and be completed during calendar year 2019.
 
As noted above, in October 2018, we initiated an exploratory clinical study of our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, in patients with NASH, and we expect to complete the study in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.
 
Raw Materials
 
Our oral insulin capsule is currently manufactured by Swiss Caps AG.
 
One of our oral capsule ingredients is being developed and produced by an Indian company.
 
In July 2010, Oramed Ltd. entered into the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or MSA, with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMBH, or Sanofi-Aventis. According to the MSA, Sanofi-Aventis will supply Oramed Ltd. with specified quantities of recombinant human insulin to be used for clinical trials.
 
We purchase, pursuant to separate agreements with third parties, the raw materials required for the manufacturing of our oral capsule. We generally depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials. Although alternative sources of supply for these materials are generally available, we could incur significant costs and disruptions if we would need to change suppliers. The termination of our relationships with our suppliers or the failure of these suppliers to meet our requirements for raw materials on a timely and cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Patents and Licenses
 
We maintain a proactive intellectual property strategy, which includes patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and other commercially significant markets. We hold 25 patent applications currently pending, with respect to various compositions, methods of production and oral administration of proteins and exenatide. Expiration dates for pending patents, if granted, will fall between 2026 and 2034.
 
We hold 74 patents, 27 of which were issued during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, or fiscal 2018, including patents issued by the United States, Swiss, German, French, U.K., Italian, Netherlands, Swedish, Spanish, Australian, Israeli, Japanese, New Zealand, South African, Russian, Canadian, Hong Kong, Chinese, European and Indian patent offices that cover a part of our technology, which allows for the oral delivery of proteins; patents issued by the Australian, Canadian, European, Austrian, Belgian, French, German, Irish, Italian, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, U.K., Israeli, New Zealand, South African, Russian and Japanese patent offices that cover part of our technology for the oral delivery of exenatide; and patents issued by the European, Austrian, Belgian, Denmark, French, German, Irish, Italian, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, U.K. and Japanese patent offices for treating diabetes.

Consistent with our strategy to seek protection in key markets worldwide, we have been and will continue to pursue the patent applications and corresponding foreign counterparts of such applications. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our intellectual property.
 
Our patent strategy is as follows:
 

● | Aggressively protect all current and future technological developments to assure strong and broad protection by filing patents and/or continuations in part as appropriate,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Protect technological developments at various levels, in a complementary manner, including the base technology, as well as specific applications of the technology, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establish comprehensive coverage in the United States and in all relevant foreign markets in anticipation of future commercialization opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, our board of directors, or our Board, technical review board and other advisors, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality or material transfer agreements from any company that is to receive our confidential information. In the case of employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our Company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
Out-Licensed Technology
 
In June 2010, Oramed Ltd. entered into a joint venture agreement with D.N.A Biomedical Solutions Ltd., or D.N.A, for the establishment of Entera Bio LTD, or Entera.
 
Under the terms of a license agreement that was entered into between Oramed Ltd. and Entera in August 2010, we out-licensed technology to Entera, on an exclusive basis, for the development of oral delivery drugs for certain indications to be agreed upon between the parties. The out-licensed technology differs from our main delivery technology that is used for oral insulin and GLP-1 analog and is subject to different patent applications. Entera’s initial development effort is for an oral formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis. In March 2011, we entered into a patent transfer agreement to replace the original license agreement pursuant to which Oramed Ltd. assigned to Entera all of its right, title and interest in and to the patent application that it had licensed to Entera in August 2010. Under this agreement, Oramed Ltd. is entitled to receive from Entera royalties of 3% of Entera’s net revenues (as defined in the agreement) and a license back of that patent application for use in respect of diabetes and influenza.
 
In March 2011, we also consummated a transaction with D.N.A, whereby we sold to D.N.A 47% of Entera’s outstanding share capital on an undiluted basis, retaining a 3% interest as of March 2011. In consideration for the shares sold to D.N.A, we received, among other payments, ordinary shares of D.N.A. The D.N.A ordinary shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and its quoted price is subject to market fluctuations, and may, at times, have a price below the value on the date we acquired such shares. In addition, the ordinary shares of D.N.A have historically experienced low trading volume; as a result, there is no guarantee that we will be able to resell the ordinary shares of D.N.A at the prevailing market prices. During the years ended August 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not sell any of the D.N.A ordinary shares. As of August 31, 2018, we held approximately 6.9% of D.N.A’s outstanding ordinary shares.

As of August 31, 2018, Entera had not yet realized any revenues. In July 2018, Entera completed an initial public offering and became listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. In August 2018, Entera announced that it completed the treatment of patients in the first part of the PK/pharmacodynamic study in hypoparathyroidism patients with its oral parathyroid hormone drug, EB612.
 
On November 30, 2015, we, our Israeli subsidiary and HTIT entered into a Technology License Agreement, and on December 21, 2015, these parties entered into an Amended and Restated Technology License Agreement that was further amended by the parties on June 3, 2016 and July 24, 2016, or the License Agreement. According to the License Agreement, we granted HTIT an exclusive commercialization license in the Territory, related to our oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, or the Product. Pursuant to the License Agreement, HTIT will conduct, at its own expense, certain pre-commercialization and regulatory activities with respect to our subsidiary’s technology and ORMD-0801 capsule, and will pay (i) royalties of 10% on net sales of the related commercialized products to be sold by HTIT in the Territory, or Royalties, and (ii) an aggregate of $37.5 million, of which $3 million was payable immediately, $8 million will be paid subject to our entry into certain agreements with certain third parties, and $26.5 million will be payable upon achievement of certain milestones and conditions. In the event that we will not meet certain conditions, the Royalties rate may be reduced to a minimum of 8%. Following the final expiration of our patents covering the technology in the Territory in 2033, the Royalties rate may be reduced, under certain circumstances, to 5%. The royalty payment obligation shall apply during the period of time beginning upon the first commercial sale of the Product in the Territory, and ending upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patents in the Territory; and (ii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of the Product in the Territory, or the Royalty Term. The License Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration of the Royalty Term. The License Agreement contains customary termination provisions. Through August 31, 2018, we received aggregate milestone payments of $17.5 million.
 
We also entered into a separate securities purchase agreement with HTIT, or the SPA, pursuant to which HTIT invested $12 million in us in December 2015 (see – “Liquidity and capital resources” below). In connection with the License Agreement and the SPA, we received a non-refundable payment of $500,000 as a no-shop fee.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Drug Development Process
 
Regulatory requirements for the approval of new drugs vary from one country to another. In order to obtain approval to market our drug portfolio, we need to go through a different regulatory process in each country in which we apply for such approval. In some cases information gathered during the approval process in one country can be used as supporting information for the approval process in another country. As a strategic decision, we decided to first explore the FDA regulatory pathway. The following is a summary of the FDA’s requirements.
 
The FDA requires that pharmaceutical and certain other therapeutic products undergo significant clinical experimentation and clinical testing prior to their marketing or introduction to the general public. Clinical testing, known as clinical trials or clinical studies, is either conducted internally by life science, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or is conducted on behalf of these companies by CROs.
 
The process of conducting clinical studies is highly regulated by the FDA, as well as by other governmental and professional bodies. Below we describe the principal framework in which clinical studies are conducted, as well as describe a number of the parties involved in these studies.
 
Protocols. Before commencing human clinical studies, the sponsor of a new drug or therapeutic product must submit an IND application to the FDA. The application contains, among other documents, what is known in the industry as a protocol. A protocol is the blueprint for each drug study. The protocol sets forth, among other things, the following:
 

● | Who must be recruited as qualified participants, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | How often to administer the drug or product, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | What tests to perform on the participants, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | What dosage of the drug or amount of the product to give to the participants. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutional Review Board. An institutional review board is an independent committee of professionals and lay persons which reviews clinical research studies involving human beings and is required to adhere to guidelines issued by the FDA. The institutional review board does not report to the FDA, but its records are audited by the FDA. Its members are not appointed by the FDA. All clinical studies must be approved by an institutional review board. The institutional review board’s role is to protect the rights of the participants in the clinical studies. It approves the protocols to be used, the advertisements which the company or CRO conducting the study proposes to use to recruit participants, and the form of consent which the participants will be required to sign prior to their participation in the clinical studies.
 
Clinical Trials. Human clinical studies or testing of a potential product are generally done in three stages known as Phase I through Phase III testing. The names of the phases are derived from the regulations of the FDA. Generally, there are multiple studies conducted in each phase.
 
Phase I. Phase I studies involve testing a drug or product on a limited number of healthy or patient participants, typically 24 to 100 people at a time. Phase I studies determine a product’s basic safety and how the product is absorbed by, and eliminated from, the body. This phase lasts an average of six months to a year.
 
Phase II. Phase II trials involve testing of no more than 300 participants at a time who may suffer from the targeted disease or condition. Phase II testing typically lasts an average of one to two years. In Phase II, the drug is tested to determine its safety and effectiveness for treating a specific illness or condition. Phase II testing also involves determining acceptable dosage levels of the drug. Phase II studies may be split into Phase IIa and Phase IIb sub-studies. Phase IIa studies may be conducted with patient volunteers and are exploratory (non-pivotal) studies, typically designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or biological activity. Phase IIb studies are conducted with patients defined to evaluate definite dose range and evaluate efficacy. If Phase II studies show that a new drug has an acceptable range of safety risks and probable effectiveness, a company will generally continue to review the substance in Phase III studies.
 
Phase III. Phase III studies involve testing large numbers of participants, typically several hundred to several thousand persons. The purpose is to verify effectiveness and long-term safety on a large scale. These studies generally last two to three years. Phase III studies are conducted at multiple locations or sites. Like the other phases, Phase III requires the site to keep detailed records of data collected and procedures performed.
 
Biological License Application. The results of the clinical trials for a biological product are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. Following the completion of Phase III studies, assuming the sponsor of a potential product in the United States believes it has sufficient information to support the safety and effectiveness of its product, the sponsor will generally submit a BLA to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. The application is a comprehensive, multi-volume filing that includes the results of all clinical studies, information about the drug’s composition, and the sponsor’s plans for producing, packaging and labeling the product. The FDA’s review of an application can take a few months to many years, with the average review lasting 18 months. Once approved, drugs and other products may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA. Approval of a BLA provides 12 years of exclusivity in the U.S. market.
 
Phase IV. The FDA may require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials following new drug approval. The purpose of these trials, known as Phase IV studies, is to monitor long-term risks and benefits, study different dosage levels or evaluate safety and effectiveness. In recent years, the FDA has increased its reliance on these trials. Phase IV studies usually involve thousands of participants. Phase IV studies also may be initiated by the company sponsoring the new drug to gain broader market value for an approved drug.
 
Similar to the U.S., a European sponsor of a biological product may submit a Marketing Approval Application to the EMA for the registration of the product. The approval process in Europe consists of several stages, which together are summed up to 210 days from the time of submission of the application (net, without periods in which the sponsor provides answers to questions raised by the agency) following which, a Marketing Approval may be granted. During the approval process, the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities will be audited in order to assess Good Manufacturing Practice compliance.
 
The drug approval process is time-consuming, involves substantial expenditures of resources, and depends upon a number of factors, including the severity of the illness in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials.

Other Regulations
 
Various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the environment and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research are applicable to our activities. They include, among others, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, import, export, and customs regulations, and other present and possible future local, state, or federal regulation. The compliance with these and other laws, regulations and recommendations can be time-consuming and involve substantial costs. In addition, the extent of governmental regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Competition
 
Competition in General
 
Competition in the area of biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development is intense and significantly depends on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical, medical products, chemical and specialized biotechnology companies, many of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain other products manufactured or under development by competitors that are used for the treatment of the diseases and health conditions that we have targeted for product development. We can provide no assurance that developments by others will not render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, that we will be able to keep pace with new technological developments or that our technology will be able to supplant established products and methodologies in the therapeutic areas that are targeted by us. The foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.
 
Competition within our sector is increasing, so we will encounter competition from existing firms that offer competitive solutions in diabetes treatment solutions. These competitive companies could develop products that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance, than the products being developed by us. We will have to compete against other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with greater market recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our technology is developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. In addition, the first product to reach the market in a therapeutic or preventive area is often at a significant competitive advantage relative to later entrants to the market. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we, or our potential corporate partners, can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are expected to be important competitive factors. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain and maintain patent protection and secure adequate capital resources. We expect our technology, if approved for sale, to compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, value and patent position.
 
Competition for Our Oral Insulin Capsule
 
We anticipate the oral insulin capsule to be a competitive diabetes drug because of its anticipated efficacy and safety profile. The following are treatment options for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients:

● | Insulin injections,
--+--------------------

 
11

 


● | Insulin pumps, or
--+------------------


● | A combination of diet, exercise and oral medication which improve the body’s response to insulin or cause the body to produce more insulin.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Several entities who are actively developing oral insulin capsules and/or alternatives to insulin are thought to be: Diabetology Ltd. (UK) and Biocon Limited (India).

Professor Avram Hershko, MD, PhD, joined the Oramed Scientific Advisory Board in July 2008. He earned his MD degree (1965) and PhD degree (1969) from the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School of Jerusalem. Professor Hershko served as a physician in the Israel Defense Forces from 1965 to 1967. After a post-doctoral fellowship with Gordon Tomkins at the University of San Francisco (1969-72), he joined the faculty of the Haifa Technion becoming a professor in 1980. He is now Distinguished Professor in the Unit of Biochemistry in the B. Rappaport Faculty of Medicine of the Technion. Professor Hershko’s main research interests concern the mechanisms by which cellular proteins are degraded, a formerly neglected field of study. Professor Hershko and his colleagues showed that cellular proteins are degraded by a highly selective proteolytic system. This system tags proteins for destruction by linkage to a protein called ubiquitin, which had previously been identified in many tissues, but whose function was previously unknown. Subsequent work by Professor Hershko and many other laboratories has shown that the ubiquitin system has a vital role in controlling a wide range of cellular processes, such as the regulation of cell division, signal transduction and DNA repair. Professor Hershko was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2004) jointly with his former PhD student Aaron Ciechanover and their colleague Irwin Rose. His many honors include the Israel Prize for Biochemistry (1994), the Gairdner Award (1999), the Lasker Prize for Basic Medical Research (2000), the Wolf Prize for Medicine (2001) and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Award (2001). Professor Hershko is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences (2000) and a Foreign Associate of the U.S. Academy of Sciences (2003).
 
Dr. Harold Jacob, MD, joined the Oramed Scientific Advisory Board in November 2016. Since 1998, Dr. Jacob has served as the president of Medical Instrument Development Inc., a company which provides a range of support and consulting services to start-up and early stage companies as well as patenting its own proprietary medical devices. Since 2011, Dr. Jacob has also served as an attending physician at Hadassah University Medical Center, where he has served as the director of the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit since September 2013. Dr. Jacob has advised a spectrum of companies in the past and he served as a consultant and then as the Director of Medical Affairs at Given Imaging Ltd., from 1997 to 2003, a company that developed the first swallowable wireless pill camera for inspection of the intestine.
