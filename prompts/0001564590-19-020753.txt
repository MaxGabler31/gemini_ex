Item 1. Business. 
 We are a leading global provider of cloud cyber resilience solutions for corporate data and email. Email is the number-one threat vector facing organizations today. Our fully-integrated, cloud services protect customers across the globe from incidents that typically start with email, including advanced cyberattacks, data loss, downtime, and human error. We mitigate the significant business disruption caused by email failure and downtime.  Our cloud archive secures, stores and manages data, while addressing compliance, regulatory and e-discovery requirements, and improving employee productivity. During the year ended March 31, 2019, or fiscal 2019, we launched our awareness training product to help our customers train their employees on security awareness and cyber risk.  Employee errors account for one of the leading causes of cybersecurity incidents. During fiscal 2019, we also introduced our web security product that protects our customers against malicious web activity initiated by employees and which also provides customers with the ability to block inappropriate websites. The web is the second highest threat vector for cyber attacks.
 Email is a critical tool for organizations of all sizes. Protecting and managing email has become more complicated due to expanding security and compliance requirements and the rapid increase in both the volume and the importance of the information transmitted via email. Organizations are increasingly at risk from security breaches of sensitive data as sophisticated email-based attacks or data leaks have become far more common than in the past. Additionally, organizations are not just using email for communication. Email archives are used as an active repository of vital corporate information needed to meet compliance and regulatory requirements and ensure employee productivity. As a result, email represents one of the highest concentrations of business risk that organizations face.
 Traditional approaches to addressing these risks leave customers managing disparate point products from multiple vendors that are often difficult to use, costly to manage, difficult to scale, can fail to fully address advanced threats, and limit the use of corporate information to enhance productivity. The resulting infrastructure complexity caused by disparate products and legacy architectures also makes it difficult to move more IT workloads to the cloud, which continues to be an increasing priority of organizations of all sizes.
 We developed our proprietary cloud architecture to offer customers a comprehensive cyber resilience strategy for email that spans security, continuity, archiving and end-user empowerment. These capabilities are delivered from an easy-to-use single platform, which now also includes our web security offering. Providing a fully-integrated service also simplifies ongoing management and service deployment. Our customers can then decommission the often costly and complex point products and on-premises technology they have traditionally used to address these risks. We also make it easier for customers to move more of their IT workloads to the cloud.
 We serve approximately 34,400 customers and protect millions of their employees around the world. Our service scales effectively to meet the needs of customers of all sizes. We sell our services through direct sales efforts and through our channel partners. Our sales model is designed to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries and in over 130 countries. We have approximately 1,500 employees located in offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, Israel and Germany. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our revenue was $340.4 million, $261.9 million and $186.6 million, respectively.
 Industry Background
 Email and web are critical tools for organizations of all sizes. Email also captures a comprehensive history of corporate activity, knowledge and data vital for day-to-day business operations and employee productivity. Email needs protection and the technology needed to protect has extended well beyond the corporate mailbox itself to include additional security, continuity and archiving services, all of which have typically been offered by separate vendors with different approaches.
 While our industry is rapidly evolving, we believe the following reflect the key themes and compelling trends that are important to understanding our industry:
  
• | Email and web are critical to all organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Many critical IT systems rely on email to operate effectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Email and web are the primary security targets for advanced cyberattacks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The amount of critical and sensitive data in email archives is growing rapidly;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data protection, cybersecurity and data privacy are key compliance and regulatory concerns for all organizations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2


 
• | Email downtime is disruptive to employee productivity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | IT workloads, including business productivity tools, are moving to the cloud;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business email mailboxes are moving to the cloud, but this creates new risks to mitigate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional email security, continuity and archiving alternatives can be inadequate and may not address increasing customer requirements and protect against next generation security threats;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Point products are inflexible and only address part of the problem;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional on-premises or hosted architectures have performance limitations and are expensive; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee training on cybersecurity risks is increasingly viewed as critical to risk mitigation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations of traditional security and archiving technologies mean customers need to rethink their approach to protecting email, web and corporate information. We believe organizations are ultimately looking to implement a multi-layered cybersecurity and resilience strategy that delivers protection of users, data and operations from the risks arising from technological failure, human error and malicious intent. The risks also increase with organizations migrating to Microsoft Office 365®, as it is a complex email solution that is a high value and high-profile target. Organizations also need robust continuity options to solve for unpredictable events that cause an outage to email and result in disruption to business. A multi-layered cybersecurity and resilience approach is needed to effectively address the diverse threats and data classifications within a single data environment. 
 Meeting this growing customer demand requires an email and data security cloud service that meets the following requirements:
  
• | Integrated Offering. By bringing multiple requirements into a cyber resilience solution for data and email platform, our service helps organizations reduce the complexity and cost of managing point technologies from disparate vendors and brings additional benefits from new capabilities made possible due to the platform, and cloud delivery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Technology. As organizations substitute specialized products provided by different vendors, it is imperative that the individual products are as good as, or better than, those being replaced. Organizations are not willing to compromise on performance or security at a product level.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Native Cloud. As organizations shift workloads to the cloud and move away from retaining on-premises or single tenant hosted cloud infrastructure, today’s email and web security and information management technology must be natively cloud-based, thereby eliminating the need for local software and hardware, virtual machines and device hosting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Built-for-Scale. As email traffic and data storage continues to increase dramatically, the risk of threats escalates and the need for real-time, on-demand email access becomes more prominent, organizations cannot compromise on email performance and availability. The ideal solution must be easily scalable to match customer demand and be able to handle large volumes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy-to-Deploy and Manage. A cloud platform should simplify the process of service updates, new product deployments and on-boarding. System improvements should also be handled centrally, reducing this burden for the customers’ own IT team. A fully-integrated service also means it should be managed from a single administration console.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptable to Customer Needs. With the rapidly shifting threat landscape and other IT requirements, customers’ email and web security needs are continuously evolving. It is important that email and web security and information management solutions adapt quickly to help organizations keep pace with changing risks and enhance productivity. In addition, organizations are increasingly interested in enhancing cybersecurity training for employees as they realize that human error is one of the key factors in many cyber incidents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower Total Cost of Ownership. The most-effective approach for corporate email security, continuity, archiving and data management is to solve the current problems of integration, performance and scalability while simplifying the IT email infrastructure and reducing the initial capital outlay, recurring maintenance costs and growing storage costs that many companies face as their volumes scale.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 We will continue to invest in our cloud security, data and risk management services. As more organizations move IT workloads such as email to the cloud, we believe we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on this growing opportunity globally.
 Our growth strategy is focused on the following:
  
• | Acquire New Customers. We have built our global cloud architecture to offer best-of-breed capabilities and to be highly scalable and affordable for organizations of any size, ranging from small and mid-market customers to the largest global enterprises. Moreover, we offer our security, continuity and archiving services as bundles and in a modular fashion, enabling us to win new customers by addressing a variety of initial needs and use cases that we are then often able to expand over time as we cross sell other offerings. We will continue to invest in a direct sales force combined with a focused channel strategy designed to serve the various requirements of small, mid-market and large enterprises and to bring new customers onto our cloud architecture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive Revenue Growth from Our Existing Customer Base. We serve approximately 34,400 customers of all sizes. We provide a high level of service that results in our customers staying with us year over year, which has resulted in a revenue retention rate of 111%, 110% and 111% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This large and loyal customer base provides us with the opportunity to sell additional services and add more employees to their subscriptions. We believe we have significant upsell potential in our existing customer base with current and new services. For a description of how we calculate our revenue retention rate, see Part 1, Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop Our Technology and Release New Services. We regularly update and improve our software and architecture and seamlessly deploy these updates to our customers. We will continue to build on our current capabilities and exploit additional opportunities in adjacent areas to those we serve today. This will extend the value our customers can gain from our architecture and enable them to consolidate additional email and data services to our integrated cloud service working seamlessly with Microsoft Exchange®, Microsoft Office 365® and G-Suite from Google®.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actively Invest in Our Channel Partner Network. The majority of our sales are through a reseller channel designed specifically to meet the requirements of each of our target customer segments. In the large enterprise market, we are building on existing relationships with leading systems integrators. In small and mid-market organizations, we are extending our network of leading IT resellers. We expect to expand our channel strategy over time to incorporate additional security or cloud specialists, as well as resellers focusing on supporting customers with the transition to Microsoft Office 365®. We intend to further invest in our network of channel partners to continually extend our global sales, service and support capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Expand Our Geographic Presence. We were founded outside the United States and, consequently, approximately 50% of our revenue in fiscal year 2019 and 51% of our revenue in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was derived from non-U.S. locations. We view the United States as our most significant growth market. Since founding our U.S. business in 2008, we have established a successful direct sales channel and service infrastructure to exploit this opportunity. We plan to investigate additional international expansion from our regional bases in the United States (for North America), the United Kingdom and Germany (for Europe), South Africa (for Africa and the Middle East), and Australia (for Asia-Pacific).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth Through Acquisitions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by acquiring complementary products, technologies and businesses. We look for products and technologies that will enable us to expand our offerings to our existing customer base and attract new customers that we were not able to service with our existing offerings. We also believe that acquisitions give us access to potential employees with industry experience that may not otherwise be available to us. In July 2018, we acquired ATAATA, Inc., or Ataata, a cybersecurity training and awareness platform designed to reduce human error in the workplace. The Ataata service forms the core of our new awareness training offering. In July 2018, we also acquired Solebit LABS, Ltd., or Solebit, an Israeli-based cybersecurity software provider that offers a fast, accurate and computationally efficient approach for the identification and isolation of zero-day malware and unknown threats in data files as well as links to external resources. We believe that our acquisition of this technology and the incorporation of such technology into our current products and services further enhances Mimecast’s cyber resilience platform architecture. In January 2019, we acquired Simply Migrate, Ltd., or Simply Migrate, a provider of archive data migration technology, which enhances the data migration services we offer our customers.

Our Technology
 We have developed a native cloud architecture, including our own proprietary software as a service, or SaaS, operating system, Mime | OS™, and customer-facing services, to address the specific risks and functional limitations of business email and data. Our innovative cloud-based approach does not require on-premises or hosted appliances. We believe we are one of only a few cloud service providers that have fully committed to native cloud development.
 We have a proven record of performing successfully at considerable scale and addressing rapidly growing customer demands. We process approximately 527 million emails per day and manage approximately 296 billion emails in total with our service. We archive approximately 54 petabytes of customer data and add more than 78.6 terabytes of customer data per month.
 We are able to provision customer email and onboard massive amounts of email data from legacy archives rapidly and efficiently. This drives customer adoption and makes the cloud transition easier than our customers typically expect. Once a customer is live on our service, adding new products to their subscription simply requires activation from within a single administration console.
 Our Proprietary Native Cloud Architecture— Mime | OS™
 We developed our proprietary operating system, Mime | OS™, for native cloud services. Mime | OS™ enables secure multi-tenancy and takes advantage of the cost and performance benefits of using industry-standard hardware and resource sharing specifically for the secure management of email and data. This enables us to provision efficiently and securely across our customer base, minimizing the impact of spare or over-provisioned processing and storage capacity, reducing the cost of providing our services.
 Mime | OS™ comprises 20+ microservices that control the hardware, and the storage, indexing, processing, services, administrator and user interface layers of our cloud environment. It has been specifically designed to enable us to scale our storage, processing and services to meet large enterprise-level email and data demands, while retaining the cost and performance benefits of a native cloud environment.
 Mime | OS™ also streamlines our customer application development and enables strong integration across our services. All of our customer applications and services, except Mimecast Awareness Training, use Mime | OS™ to interact with our data stores and processing technology, as well as interoperate effectively with each other. We expect that Mimecast Awareness Training will be on Mime | OS™ during the first half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
 Continuous Development Methodology and Multi-Tenancy Advantage
 As we enhance and expand our technology, we can update services centrally with little or no intervention required by the customer, as each customer shares the same core operating and application software. Improvements, upgrades, new products or patches are applied once and are available immediately across our whole service to customers. It means we have only one up-to-date version of our service to maintain and support as well as a common data store for all customers that simplifies management, support and product development.
 Our commitment to continual improvement in Mime | OS™, our customer applications and our hardware infrastructure mean we are constantly strengthening the performance of our service as we scale. These improvements include faster archive search times and data ingestion, greater storage density, improved processing and extended security coverage. Each week, we roll out updates and enhancements centrally that benefit our customers without the need for additional infrastructure investment on their part. Additionally, when new threats emerge, we act once by making changes to our service and all customers benefit immediately. We can also identify and act on threats to one customer and quickly prevent them from impacting others by changing our core system.

How Our Services Work
 Mimecast Advanced Security
 We protect inbound and outbound email from malware, spam, advanced persistent threats, email Denial of Service, or DoS, and Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, data leaks and other security threats.
 Inbound email is directed through Mimecast Email Security, which performs comprehensive security checks before the email is delivered to the customer’s email infrastructure. This prevents unwanted email from reaching the customer in the first place and cluttering their infrastructure unlike on-premises services from competitors. Each day, we monitor approximately 1.2 billion messages and deliver, on average, less than 50% of those messages to the customer.
 Outbound email sent from the customer also passes through our service and is checked before being sent on to prevent it from presenting a security threat to the recipient. Outbound email can also be encrypted and scanned by our comprehensive content controls to prevent confidential documents or data leaving the business. Data leak prevention is a key consideration for all organizations.
 Mimecast Business Continuity
 Email is a 24x7 tool and, traditionally, customers who want to ensure their email does not experience downtime as a result of an inevitable outage or maintenance have had to replicate their own infrastructure in a second location, doubling their email-related costs. The cost and management burden of doing this is prohibitive for many, particularly small or mid-market organizations.
 We are a cost-effective alternative as there is no need for additional infrastructure. As all customer outbound and inbound email is directed to our servers, if a customer’s primary email service fails, our Mimecast Mailbox Continuity service takes over the delivery and sending of email in real time or at the request of the administrator, offering immediate fail-over and fail-back. When the primary service is re-established, the customer is reassured that there has been no loss of data and that the archive is maintained. For employees, the process is virtually invisible—they continue to work as before in their Microsoft Outlook® desktop email client, their Mimecast mobile app or their Mac® Desktop App.
 Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving
 Email, and the data it contains, needs to be safely archived to meet growing compliance, regulatory and legal obligations. Also, employees are increasingly using their email archive as their primary information store so this is further reason to ensure it is protected and archived effectively.
 As email, file attachments, and associated critical metadata that identifies activity is sent or received, it can be saved in a secure, tamper-proof archive in the Mimecast cloud automatically and indefinitely. Our employee mobile and desktop search tools and administration console then allow for detailed investigation of the archive. We also enable customers with legacy archive data to put this into their single Mimecast archive, which improves adherence to data compliance obligations and gives employees access to a complete historical view of their archive.
 Our Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving service offers secure lifetime storage of email, files and instant messaging conversations paid for on a per-employee basis and not on a data usage basis. By switching to the Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving Service, expensive and ineffective onsite archives can be decommissioned, reducing the data load on the primary email service. Our search tools make it easy for legal staff and employees to quickly find data without the need to turn to the IT team. Finally, our archive can also include legacy data that would otherwise be held in additional storage. This can be ingested over-the-wire or via encrypted physical drives sent from the customer to us.
 
Mimecast Web Security
 Mimecast Web Security service protects against malicious web activity initiated by user action or malware and blocks access to inappropriate websites based on acceptable use policies.  When a user makes a request for a web-based resource (typically in a browser) by clicking a link or typing in an address, that request is then forwarded to the service for resolution and inspection or filtering. The service applies the customer’s acceptable use controls, as well as any bypass exceptions, and evaluates the site’s classification to determine if the site safe or unsafe. Access to unsafe web resources is blocked, and the user is notified via a block page. Access to safe web resources is immediately allowed, with the IP address of the requested site being returned to the user’s browser so the content can be accessed.  Access logs and associated reports generated by the service are available for review by a system administrator with the appropriate privileges.

Our Global Data Center Network
 We have built networks in twelve data centers in six locations around the world to deliver our services, except Mimecast Awareness Training where we currently leverage Amazon Web Services® for delivery of certain aspects of the service. This gives customers geographic and jurisdictional control over data location, which enables them to address data privacy concerns. Each region operates two identical data centers that function in active-active mode in different locations, and have N+1 set-ups to meet our continuity of service commitments. Because of this redundancy, we can switch operations from one data center to another to maintain our customers’ email and data services. We have developed a modular approach to provisioning a new data center and can transition among data centers as needed in existing or new geographies. Our twelve co-located data centers are replicated and operate in active-active mode to allow for continuity of service in the event of downtime or maintenance.

• | URL Protect addresses the threat from emails containing malicious links. It automatically checks hyperlinks each time they are clicked, preventing employees from visiting malicious websites regardless of what email client or device they are using. It also includes innovative user awareness capabilities so IT teams can raise the security awareness of employees as part of their daily email activities. Once enabled, a percentage of links in emails clicked by an employee will open an informational screen. This will provide employees with more information about the email and its destination, encouraging them to consider whether the email is coming from a reliable source and if the page is safe. If the employee chooses to continue, the choice is logged and URL Protect scans the link and blocks access if the destination is deemed unsafe. IT administrators can adjust the frequency of these awareness prompts to ensure employee caution is maintained. Repeat offenders that regularly click bad links can automatically receive more frequent prompts until their behavior changes. The IT team can track employee behavior from the Mimecast administration console and target additional security training as required.

• | Attachment Protect reduces the threat from weaponized or malware-laden attachments used in spear-phishing and other advanced attacks. It includes pre-emptive sandboxing to automatically security check email attachments before they are delivered to employees. Attachments are opened in a virtual environment, or sandbox, isolated from the email system, security checked and passed on to the employee only if no threat is detected. It also includes the option of an innovative safe file conversion capability that automatically converts attachments into a safe file format, neutralizing any chance of malware. The attachment is delivered to the employee in read-only format without any sandbox analysis delay. As most attachments are read rather than edited, this is often sufficient for many users. Should the employee need to edit the attachment, they can request it and from there it is sandboxed on-demand and delivered in the original file format.

• | Impersonation Protect gives instant and comprehensive protection from malware-less social engineering attacks, often called CEO fraud, whaling, impersonation, or business email compromise. These attacks are designed to trick users, most particularly key employees such as those who are on an organization’s finance team, into making wire transfers or other financial transactions to cybercriminals by pretending to be the CEO or CFO via spoofed email. Some impersonation attacks also target those responsible for managing sensitive employee data, such as payroll information, which could be used for identity theft. Impersonation Protect detects and prevents these types of attacks by identifying combinations of key indicators in an email to determine if the content is likely to be suspicious, even in the absence of a URL or attachment. Impersonation Protect blocks or flags suspicious email by using advanced scanning techniques to identify elements commonly used by criminals, including employee, domain, or reply-to names, and other keywords such as ‘wire transfer,’ ‘tax form’ or ‘urgent.’

• | Internal Email Protect, or IEP, allows customers to monitor, detect and remediate security threats that originate from within their internal email systems. This capability provides for the scanning of attachments, URLs, and content in internally generated email. In addition, IEP includes the ability to automatically remediate infected email from a user’s inbox.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secure Messaging: Email containing sensitive or confidential information requires appropriate security and control to prevent inadvertent or deliberate data leaks and to protect the information while in transit. Mimecast Secure Messaging is a secure and private channel to share sensitive information with external contacts via email without the need for additional client or desktop software. Sensitive information is kept within the Mimecast cloud service, strengthening information security, data governance and compliance, without the added IT overhead and complexity of traditional email secure messaging or encryption solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large File Send: Employees can create security and compliance risks when they turn to file sharing services to overcome email size limits imposed by their email infrastructure. Mimecast Large File Send enables PC and Mac® users to send and receive large files directly from Microsoft Outlook® or a native Mac® app. It protects attachments in line with security and content policies by using encryption, optional access key and custom expiration dates; supports audit, e-discovery and compliance by archiving all files and notifications according to email retention policies; and protects email system performance from the burden of large file traffic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mimecast Business Continuity
 Email continuity protects email and data against the threat of downtime as a result of system failure, natural disasters, planned maintenance, system upgrades and migrations. Mimecast Mailbox Continuity services significantly reduce the cost and complexity of mitigating these risks and provides uninterrupted access to live and historic email and calendar information. During an outage our service provides real-time inbound, outbound and internal email delivery. The continuity service can be activated and deactivated directly and instantly from the Mimecast console by administrators for the complete organization or for specific groups affected by limited outages. All outage events are fully logged. We also support email top-up services for customers who have to recover their Microsoft Exchange® environments from backups. The continuity service is capable of reliably and securely supporting customers during short or long-term continuity events. Integration with Microsoft Outlook®, a native app for Mac® users and a full suite of mobile apps means employees have seamless access to their email in the event of a disruption or outage.
 Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving
 Our cloud archive consolidates into one store all inbound, outbound and internal email, files and instant messaging in a perpetual, indexed and secure archive. Using our Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving service, customers can also incorporate legacy data from additional archives into the same searchable store.
 All data is encrypted and preserved within a Write Once Read Many, or WORM, state. Proprietary indexing and retrieval solutions allow customers to search individual mailboxes or the entire corporate archive in seconds. Our mobile, tablet, desktop and web applications ensure that employees can search and make the best use of their entire corporate archive in a fast, reliable and informative way. Intensive logging services cover the use of the archive, and roles and permissions govern what employees can see in the archive based on their role. Our purpose-built ingestion and export services support rapid high-volume extraction, scrubbing and loading of significant quantities of data. Our archive solution retains metadata that arises from gateway and continuity operations and we preserve both received and altered variants of emails that pass through our secure email gateway. Retention options for customers range from individual retentions, to data retained for an entire customer on a perpetual basis.

Customers can also purchase the following additional services as part of our Mimecast Enterprise Information Archiving offering:
  
• | Recoverability: Email continues to be the preferred business communication tool and de facto data repository. It holds vast amounts of critical and sensitive information. Protecting the data in emails against loss or corruption and managing spiraling inboxes is imperative to organizations of all sizes. Mimecast Sync & Recover, which works with Microsoft Exchange® and Microsoft Office 365®, offers three key capabilities on top of the built-in tools provided by Mimecast Archiving, including Sync & Recover, Granular Retention Management and Mailbox Storage (Stubbing) Management. Sync & Recover delivers rapid and granular recovery of mailboxes, calendar items and contacts lost through inadvertent or malicious deletion or corruption.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Archive Power Tools: This is a series of advanced archiving tools including:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mimecast Storage Management for Exchange: This enables active mailbox size management, so administrators can optimize email system performance, control costs and support archive policy enforcement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mailbox and Folder Tools for Exchange: In an email continuity event or when searching for archived content, access to folder structures and shared mailbox content is key to productivity. This tool makes it easy to replicate individual and shared mailbox folders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Granular Retention Management: Managing email retention policies can be complex and time-consuming, because different business groups and individuals have varying requirements for email retention including, for example, how long email should, or is required to be retained. Mimecast Granular Retention Management enables IT teams to centrally apply policies to manage the retention of email content and related metadata.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mimecast Compliance Protect: This feature, which was launched in fiscal 2019, assists customers in highly regulated industries comply with the significant record retention requirements of various regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mimecast Web Security
 In fiscal year 2019, we launched Mimecast Web Security. As the workplace has changed and the how, when and where employees work has become increasingly flexible with users wanting to work anytime, anywhere, and on any device, the landscape for how our customers manage risk, from cloud applications outside their sanctioned IT systems to guest or public Wi-Fi networks, has become increasingly challenging. Email and the web are the sources of nearly all data security incidents and breaches that occur. Most organizations do not monitor domain name system, or DNS, activity, leaving them vulnerable to this communications path. The Mimecast Web Security service protects against malicious web activity initiated by user action or malware, ransomware and other malicious software, and blocks access to inappropriate websites, based on business polices. Our Mimecast Web Security Service adds strong security at the DNS layer of the web and is easy to implement and manage. When combined with the Mimecast Secure Email Gateway, organizations can use a single, cloud-based service that protects against the two dominant cyberattack vectors: email and the web. The combined solution is also built to leverage each customer’s existing configurations for directory synchronization, branding, role-based access control, and other core platform features to help reduce both set-up time and maintenance. 
Mimecast Awareness Training
 In order to help our customers address security risks associated with the activities of their employees, in fiscal 2019, we launched Mimecast Awareness Training.  Mimecast Awareness Training addresses a customer’s vulnerability to human error by combining effective, modern and engaging training techniques with predictive analytics. Our advanced risk scoring of our customers’ employees uncovers problems that cut across multiple issues and behaviors, enabling customers to be proactive about mitigation. By leveraging the risk score, customers can deliver personalized training regimens or tailor system permissions and access for individual employees based on risky behavior and likelihood of being targeted for attack.
Service Bundles
 Many of our customers take advantage of the ability to combine our services and capabilities into a unified service managed from a single administration console. Most customers purchase the bundles from the outset, but some prefer to start with specific packages, then upgrade to additional products over time. Our service range continues to respond to the changing threat landscape and reflect customers’ requests for combinations of services across advanced security, including email and web, continuity, archiving and awareness training.

Mimecast Mobile and Desktop Apps
 Mobile, PC and Mac® users get self-service access to security features, including spam reporting and managed sender lists, the ability to send and receive email during a primary email system outage, and access to their personal email archive to run searches on its content. Administrators can use granular permissions to activate functions for individual employees or groups of users, while centralized security and policy management means IT teams can retain control over default settings.
Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing teams work together to build a strong sales pipeline, cultivate and retain customers and drive market awareness of our current and future products and services.
Sales
 We sell our services through direct sales efforts and through our channel partners. Our sales model is designed to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries and in over 130 countries. Our sales team is based in offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, United States; London, United Kingdom; Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa; Melbourne and Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Dubai, UAE and Munich, Germany. We maintain a highly-trained sales force of approximately 440 employees as of March 31, 2019, which is responsible for acquiring and developing new business.
 We also have an experienced sales team focused on developing and strengthening our channel partner relationships. Many organizations work with third-party IT channel partners to meet their security, IT and cloud service needs, so we have formed relationships with a variety of the leading partners to target large enterprises, mid-market and small organizations. For large enterprises, we work with international partners including CDW and Dimension Data. In the mid-market, we work with leading national partners, including Softchoice, SHI, CDW and Softcat. The small business market is primarily served by the reseller community and by managed service providers, who typically provide or host email services. We work closely with all channel partners to offer cooperative marketing, deal registration, as well as support and technical resources. We believe these partners view our services as a key source of additional revenue and a way for them to add significant value to their customers as they can support their desire to move to the cloud without compromising their security position.
 Sales to our channel partners are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive channel partner agreement, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies. These agreements are generally for a term of one year with a one-year renewal term and can be terminated by us or the channel partner. Payment to us from the channel partner is typically due within 30 calendar days of the date we issue an invoice for such sales.
 Our sales cycle varies by size and sophistication of customer, the number of products purchased and the complexity of the project, ranging from several days for incremental sales to existing customers, to many months for sales to new customers or large deployments.
 We plan to continue to invest in our sales organization to take advantage of a large market opportunity through both the growth of our direct sales organization and investment in our channel partners.
 Marketing
 Our marketing strategy is designed to meet the specific needs of each of our customer segments. We are focused on building the Mimecast brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption of our products, communicating the advantages of our solution and its benefit to organizations, and generating leads for our channel partners and direct sales force. We also invest in public relations and thought leadership to build our overall brand and visibility. We execute our marketing strategy by using a combination of internal marketing professionals and a network of global channel partners. We invest in field, channel, product and brand marketing and have increased our investment in digital marketing to drive greater lead generation volume and efficiency. 
Customer Service and Support
 We maintain our strong customer retention rate through the strength and quality of our products, our commitment to our customers’ success and our award-winning global Customer Success and Support teams, which consist of approximately 320 employees dedicate
d to ensuring a superior experience for our customers. For each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our customer retention rate has been consistently greater than 90%. We calculate our annual customer retention rate as the percentage of paying customers on the last day of the prior year who remain paying customers on the last day of the current year.

We have designed a comprehensive monitoring methodology that measures and evaluates the interactions we have with our customers from sales and on-boarding to support and renewal. Our cross-functional teams, under the supervision of our Chief of Customer Operations, work together to ensure the best customer experience is achieved and to address customer needs as they arise.
 A key value driver of our customer on-boarding process is our Legacy Data Migration services. Our customers often have legacy email archives that they want to move to the cloud. As data loads increase these archives become more and more cumbersome to manage and can reach 400TB or more in some cases. Our data migration service helps solve the problems customers face when extracting data and getting it into the right format for importing to the cloud, which can be expensive, time-consuming and require interactions with multiple vendors. We expect that the technology we acquired in connection with the Simply Migrate acquisition will enhance the data migration services we offer to our customers.
 In addition, we offer a full range of support services to our global customer base, including comprehensive online resources and email support with no outsourcing of support or account management to third parties. We also offer various additional services that include options for 24x7 telephone support and an assigned customer success manager. These support services are tiered to meet specific requirements of our diverse customers. Our full range of customer outcome driven onboarding services is designed to cater to all customer segments. These services include dedicated implementation and onboarding consultancy services. We have a dedicated training team and resources designed to enable customers to get the full benefit from their investment. Our comprehensive education and consultancy offerings include administrator training and certification, end-user training, and e-discovery training for compliance teams, all of which are available in-person and online.
 Beyond customer support and training, we also provide a range of services that are designed to provide additional enablement to customers who require it, especially larger enterprises with more complex email infrastructure and legacy data. Our Success Planning and Professional Services teams work directly with the customer or partner to assist them in planning, migration and service activation.
 We offer a service level agreement as part of our standard contract that contains commitments regarding the delivery of email messages to and from our servers, the speed at which our archive can produce search results, and our ability to correctly identify and isolate spam and viruses. If we do not achieve these levels, the customer can request a credit. Payment of the credit will be made subject to verification of the problem. These credits are tiered according to the extent of the service issued. The amount of credits provided to customers to date has been immaterial in all historical periods.
 Customers
 As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 34,400 customers and protected millions of their employees in over 130 countries. Our diverse global footprint is evidenced by the fact that in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we generated 50% of our revenue from the United States, 31% from the United Kingdom, 14% from South Africa and 5% from the rest of the world. Our customers range from large enterprises with approximately 95,000 employees to small organizations with less than 50 employees and represent a diverse set of industries. For example, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we generated 11% of our revenue from customers in the legal services industry, 14% from customers in the professional, scientific and technical services industry, 10% from customers in the manufacturing industry and 13% from customers in the finance and insurance industry. Our business is not dependent on any single customer. No single customer represented more than 1% of our annual revenues in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Research and Development
 Our engineering, operations, product and development teams work together to enhance our existing products, technology infrastructure and underlying Mime | OS™ cloud architecture, as well as develop our new product pipeline. Our research and development and product management team interacts with our customers and partners to address emerging market needs, counter developing threats and drive innovation in risk management and data protection. We operate a continuous delivery model for improvements to our infrastructure and products to ensure customers benefit from regular updates in protection and functionality without the need for significant intervention on their part. Our research and development and product management efforts give prominence to services that enhance our unification commitment and allow customers to displace point solutions or on-premises products.
 13


Intellectual Property
 Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and other intellectual property rights. We primarily rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of March 31, 2019, we have 15 patents issued and 18 patent applications pending in the United States. We also have 5 patents issued and 1 patent applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
 We have registered “Mimecast” and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions. We also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “mimecast.com,” “mimecast.co.uk,” “mimecast.co.za,” and similar variations.
 In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, as part of our confidentiality procedures, all of our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and they assign to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, partners, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information.
 Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosures of our products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great of an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States. Our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and misappropriation of our proprietary information may increase as a result of our foreign operations.
 We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap. Moreover, many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents, or filed patent applications, and have asserted claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties, including non-practicing patent entities, have from time to time claimed, and could claim in the future, that our technologies infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or be issued in the future. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors — We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 Our market is large, highly competitive, fragmented, and subject to rapidly evolving technology and security threats, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We do not believe that any specific competitor offers the fully unified service and integrated technology that we do. However, we do compete with companies that offer products that target email, web and data security, continuity and archiving, as well as large providers such as Google Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, who offer functions and tools as part of their core mailbox services that may be, or be perceived to be, similar to our offerings. Our current and potential future competitors include: Barracuda Networks, Inc., Google, Microsoft Exchange Online Protection, Proofpoint, Inc., Symantec Corporation, Agari Data, Inc., and Cisco Systems Inc., in security; Dell EMC, Microsoft Office® 365®, Proofpoint, Veritas Technologies LLC, Smarsh Inc., and Barracuda in archiving; KnowBe4, Inc., Cofense Inc., and Wombat Security, a division of Proofpoint, in awareness training; and Cisco, Webroot Inc., TitanHQ’s Webtitan, SafeDNS, Inc., Akamai Technologies, Inc, Infoblox Inc., Forcepoint LLC, Trustwave Holdings, Inc., and Zscaler, Inc. in web security. Some of our current and future competitors may have certain competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer operating history, larger market share, larger existing user base and greater financial, technical and other resources. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies, threats and changes in customer needs. We cannot provide any assurance that our competitors will not offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or achieve greater market acceptance.
 The principal competitive factors in our market include, but are not limited to:
  
• | reliability and effectiveness in protecting, detecting and responding to cyberattacks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scalability and multi-tenancy of our system;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | breadth and unification of our services;
--+-----------------------------------------

 14


 
• | cloud-only delivery;
--+---------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | speed, availability and reliability;
--+-------------------------------------


• | integration into office productivity, desktop and mobile tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | speed at which our services can be deployed;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | ease of user experience for IT administrators and employees; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | superior customer service and commitment to customer success.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product and cloud architecture development, core technical innovation, channel management and customer support.
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2019, we had 1,495 employees and subcontractors, including 606 in sales and marketing, 310 in research and development, 317 in services and support and 262 in general and administrative. While we have operations in the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, Australia, Germany and Israel, most of our employees are based in the United Kingdom and the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
