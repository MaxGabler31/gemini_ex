ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Our mission is to make all dogs happy. 
We believe that dogs and humans are better together and we aspire to be the world’s favorite dog brand. We are a team of dog-obsessed people committed to delivering personalization at scale by satisfying each dog’s distinct personality, preferences, and needs. Since our founding in 2011, we have happily served over six million dogs and their people.
We are a vertically integrated, omnichannel brand serving dogs across four key categories: play, food, health, and home. All of our products are designed, developed, and branded BARK. We leverage an ever-growing collection of proprietary data, customer insights, and machine learning to deliver personalized products and experiences tailored to the needs of each and every dog we serve. Our products are primarily sold direct-to-consumer (“DTC”), and on a subscription basis, which we believe provides us with strong visibility into future revenue. We also sell many of our products through our network of retail partners. The Company signed 23 new retail partners in FY 2022 which will increase BARK’s presence to over 40,000 doors in fiscal year 2023. 
We began our journey in the play category with BarkBox – a monthly-themed subscription of toys and treats, tailored to the needs of each customer based on their dog’s size, play style, allergies, and more. By viewing each dog as an individual, and by creating magical experiences for our customers, we have been able to build lasting relationships with millions of dogs and their parents. Our customer service–Happy Team–proactively engages over 250,000 customers each month. We use the valuable data from these customer interactions to inform the design and development of future products, and we leverage it along with machine learning technology to recommend additional products to our customers through cross-selling and Add-to-Box (“ATB”). This data helps drive Average Order Value (“AOV”) and improves customer retention. In 2017 we launched Super Chewer, our second product in the play category, which expanded our addressable market and enabled us to scale our customer base more quickly. 
We believe that we have created a category-defining brand that has captured a healthy share of the roughly $3 billion dog toy market. On March 31, 2022, we served approximately 2.3 million active subscriptions, over 9 million social media followers, and more than ten million email contacts, which affords us meaningful insights and reach with a significant portion of the U.S. dog population. 
Over the past 24 months, we have entered exciting new categories like food and health that have expanded our total addressable market to over $40 billion. We are approaching food and health with the same playbook that made BarkBox and SuperChewer so successful. By viewing each dog as an individual, and by personalizing their experience. Historically, personalization at scale has not been feasible in areas like food, because there simply isn’t enough retail shelf space, plus they lack the information on millions of dogs that’s necessary to serve them as individuals. We believe that our detailed information on over six million dogs and our proven ability to customize products at scale gives us a big advantage and opportunity to win in this category. 
Over the past year, we have grown our customer base, enhanced our cross-selling capabilities, and launched new and innovative products that significantly expanded our total addressable market. These achievements helped drive a 34% year-over-year increase in fiscal 2022 revenue to $507 million.
Our Industry
Large, growing, and resilient market for pet products: 
According to the American Pet Products Association (“APPA”), annual spend on pets in the U.S. was $123.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $20 billion, or over 19%, compared to 2020. According to a 2020 Euromonitor International (“Euromonitor International”) report, pet care—relative to other industries—remained recession-resistant and even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many pet owners have been willing to cut back spending on themselves in favor of spending on their pets.
Dog ownership is growing quickly: 
According to the 2021-22 APPA Survey, dogs are the most popular pet in the U.S., with more than 69 million households having a dog as a member of their family. This reflects an increase of roughly 6 million, compared to 2020. Out of those 69 million U.S. dog households, we are serving approximately 2.3 million dog households as of March 31, 2022. We believe we have an opportunity to significantly expand our customer base, both in the U.S. and globally.
An accelerating shift to digital and e-commerce: 
E-commerce sales continue to grow faster than the overall retail sales market and are increasingly taking significant share from brick-and-mortar retail. Sales of dog-related products have mirrored this trend as dog owners, increasingly shift a greater share of their dog-related purchasing to online options and subscription-based offerings across all categories. The pet food category has been a major driver of this channel shift. According to Packaged Facts, an estimated 37% of all pet food sales occurred online in 2021, as compared to 32% in 2020. By 2025, Packaged Facts estimate roughly 55% of all U.S. pet sales will occur online. 
Our Segments and Products
We operate two business segments across the play, food, health, and home categories: direct to consumer and commerce. Our direct-to-consumer business, which is primarily comprised of subscription-based products delivered on a monthly basis, drives the majority of our revenues and represented 88.3% of total revenue in fiscal 2022. Our commerce business, which reflects the sale of BARK products in retail stores and other e-tailers, significantly broadens our customer reach and raises awareness for the BARK brand. The Company has executed agreements that will bring BARK products to over 40,000 retail doors, including Target, Costco, Walmart, Petco, and Petsmart. This segment represented 11.7% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022.
Our Key Products:
Barkbox and Super Chewer (Play Category)—These subscription products feature monthly themed boxes of premium-quality BARK toys and treats that are delivered directly to a dog’s home. Subscribers have the option to increase the number of toys and treats or add incremental products each month through our monthly Add-to-Box (“ATB”) offering. We also offer the toys and treats included in subscription boxes as individual SKUs through our website BarkShop.com (“BarkShop”) as well as through BARK’s retail partners. As of March 31, 2022, BARK serves 2.3 million Active Subscribers, representing hundreds of thousands of customer-tailored boxes each month.
BARK Food (Food Category)—BARK Food is our personalized monthly meal plan serving the $35 billion-plus dog food segment. By leveraging our strong customer relationships, growing data set, and in-house vet nutritionists, BARK is able to create personalized meal plans through a blend of base kibbles, toppers, and supplements. Our in-house vet nutritionists help curate meal plans based on breed, age, weight, and other dietary needs to ensure we serve each dog as an individual; the same approach that made BarkBox and Super Chewer a success. We believe that innovation in the dog food market has been scarce and is ripe for disruption. Historically, personalization at scale has not been feasible; there is not enough retail shelf space to serve each dog as an individual. We believe we are the first digitally-native, direct-to-consumer brand that offers a personalized, adjustable, and customizable monthly dog food service at a mass-market price point. Further, we believe that the value proposition of BARK Food will appeal broadly to dog parents.
BARK Bright (Health Category)—BARK Bright is the first product in our health category. BARK Bright is a unique dental product that combines a proprietary triple-enzymatic gel, developed in partnership with Novozymes Bio Ag, with a delicious treat-like dental stick. BARK Bright eliminates the arduous task of brushing a dog’s teeth while still effectively fighting germs and bad breath. Our BARK Bright dental kit provides an innovative regimen for dog dental care, and is available through monthly subscriptions, ATB, individually on Barkshop, and through certain retail partnerships. 
BARK Home (Home Category)—BARK Home offers dog parents a variety of products for daily life, including dog beds, bowls, collars, harnesses, and leashes. We sell BARK Home products through our website BarkShop.com and through certain retail partners.
We also sell a combination of our toys and treats, BARK Bright, and BARK Home products through our network of retail partners.
We also collaborate with, and make products for other brands such as Disney, Warner Bros, Universal Studios, the NBA, and more. 
Our Strengths
Ever-Growing Data Drives Personalization at Scale: 
We know the names, age, breed, birthdays, play style, allergies, and more for over 6 million dogs. We believe that this is a key competitive advantage as it enables us to deliver highly personalized products and experiences for each and every dog that we serve. We are able to tailor our products to each customer by collecting proprietary product and customer data with each interaction. We also leverage our machine learning technology and first-party data set to compare dogs’ attributes against our available inventory when recommending products for purchase via cross-selling or ATB. In addition, we believe that personalization requires more than curation. We apply our data-driven customization approach to our product design and development as well, so that our products themselves, and not just our recommendations, are tailored to meet particular dog attributes that have been expressed to us. 
Deep Customer Relations Drive Retention and Lifetime Value: 
Our strong customer relationships are at the heart of what we do. Our customer service team–the Happy Team–proactively engages over 250,000 customers each month. We get to know their dog’s preferences based on breed, size, age, play style, allergies, and more. This allows us to personalize our products and experiences for each customer, which we believe drives stronger retention and lifetime value. 
Vertically Integrated:
All of our products are designed, developed, and branded BARK, which drives higher margins. We believe that our data and insights have enabled us to design and make superior products for dogs as well as to create new products that dogs and their dog parents love. By employing an in-house team of world-class designers to design our products and having them made exclusively for us, rather than selling third-party products, we have created a collection of high-quality and unique, and cleverly-themed products, with strong brand association and higher potential for profitability. By designing our own products, we have the opportunity to achieve higher price points, therefore expanding our gross margins. 
Omnichannel:
While the majority of our revenues are driven by our DTC business, we derived $59 million, or 11.7% of our revenues from the sale of BARK products in retail stores and other e-tailers in fiscal 2022. The Company has executed agreements that will bring BARK products to over 40,000 retail doors, including Target, Costco, Walmart, Petco, and Petsmart. We believe that these partnerships significantly broaden our customer reach and raise awareness for the BARK brand. We believe that this business also serves to introduce first-time customers to BARK who later become loyal subscribers of our DTC business.
Growth Opportunities
We strive to be a dog parent’s partner from those first days with a puppy throughout their dog’s entire adult life. BARK seeks to be there every step of the way serving dogs’ needs in Play, Food, Health, and Home. Our ambition is to grow BARK to be the world’s favorite dog brand. We are focused on several key areas that we believe will be significant drivers to our business, long-term.
New Product Categories Expected to Grow Customer Base and Lifetime Value:
We believe the food and health categories afford us a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, increase AOV, and improve customer retention, long-term. We are approaching food and health with a similar playbook that made BarkBox and Super Chewer so successful—by treating each dog as an individual and creating personalized experiences for each of them. With roughly 6 million current and former customers, we know the names, ages, breeds, play-style, allergies, and more for more than 6 million dogs. We believe that this data and our strong customer relationships afford us a unique opportunity to win market share in categories like food and health. We believe that innovation and personalization in these categories have historically been scarce, as there isn’t enough retail shelf space to serve each dog individually, and, most dog food companies don’t get to know your dog at checkout. We believe our DTC approach, coupled with our valuable data and strong customer relationships will enable us to win a share in these categories.
Unified Customer Experience Expected to Enhance Cross-Selling and Awareness:
Historically, BARK operated five siloed businesses and customer experiences – BarkBox, SuperChewer, BarkBright, BarkFood, and BarkShop. Each of these businesses had distinct websites, dashboards, and logins. Becoming BARK is focused on unifying our brand and the customer experience. This initiative will ensure that all of our current and prospective customers are made aware of our full suite of products. We also expect it to materially improve our cross-selling capabilities and ultimately enhance the overall experience that customers have with BARK. We also anticipate it will grow our average order value at an even faster pace. For example, BarkBox.com sees over 2 million unique visitors every month and, in the past, we offered them only toys & treats for their dogs. This is a huge opportunity. By simply offering dental, food, and other products to these visitors, along with an incentive to try something new, we leverage the brand equity and exposure of BarkBox in a meaningful way. This is one simple way of cross-selling our products in these new product lines to accelerate our growth in these new categories.
Our People and Culture
The Team
As dog people, BARK employees join the company because they are aligned with our mission to make all dogs happy. The work we are doing is inherently joyful, optimistic, and humorous because our primary customers, dogs, possess all of those characteristics. To that end, our company culture is centered around kindness, fairness, and a high level of ambition to serve all dogs and their humans.
At the end of fiscal 2022, BARK employed approximately 643 full-time and part-time employees. Our employee population includes approximately 227 Bark Happy Ambassadors and their leadership, 96 engineers, data scientists, and technology staff, 93 designers and creative team members, 102 operations and fulfillment center employees, and 125 marketing, general, and administrative employees. As of March 31, 2022, 65% of our employees, 36% of our management team, and 33% of our Board of Directors identified as female or nonbinary. 
Employee Engagement
Team communication is frequent and direct, allowing for a high level of transparency and feedback. We engage with employees through monthly pulse surveys to measure employee engagement, receive feedback, and respond to employee concerns effectively. We leverage these data points to continuously evolve our policies and practices to meet employee needs and align with BARK team values. Though most of the team has worked remotely since March 2020, we currently use our offices in New York, New York and Columbus, Ohio for regular team collaboration, all hands meetings, workshops and more. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At BARK, we recognize that people, like dogs, should be celebrated for their differences and the diverse life experiences they bring to work each day. We advocate for and celebrate a culture of inclusiveness for all people regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, family status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical ability, 
veteran status, age, or love of cats as we work toward one common goal: to make every single dog as happy as they make us. We do this by focusing on four key areas:
•Diversity Sourcing & Recruitment: Promote an inclusive approach to hiring diverse talent by focusing on the equity of recruiting processes in addition to sourcing pools.
•Continuous Learning & Communication: Make diversity and inclusion everyone’s responsibility by providing training and educational opportunities.
•Employee Resource Groups: Provide employees with opportunities and resources to build a shared, supportive community while also advancing the team’s Diversity Equity and Inclusion mission.
•Accountability: Ensure accountability while committing to focus on retention, advancement, and equity. 
BARK is committed to paying employees fairly for their work. Our Total Rewards team determines and regularly reviews all compensation based on a leveling and benchmarking system guided by market insights from third-party experts and tools. On a quarterly basis, we review all grants of equity for parity across gender and race to ensure that we are taking a consistent approach to compensation for all team members based on market data, role, and level.
Manufacturing
BARK purchases substantially all of its merchandise directly from third-party manufacturers, who typically manufacture the products exclusively for BARK. Some of these vendors operate their own manufacturing facilities and others subcontract the manufacturing to other parties. BARK’s manufacturers generally agree to terms that are substantially similar to its standard manufacturer terms, which govern its business relationships. Although we do not have long-term agreements with our vendors, BARK has long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors that BARK believes to be mutually satisfactory. These vendors are located in multiple countries, which we believe helps mitigate our supply chain risk.
All of our exclusive products are required to be produced according to BARK’s specifications, and our manufacturers warrant that such products will perform in accordance with BARK’s specifications. Our manufacturing and supplier contracts are generally on year-to-year terms and provide BARK with the additional right to terminate the agreement for uncured material breaches within thirty days. We require that all of our manufacturers comply with applicable laws and BARK generally has the right to audit the suppliers’ facilities.
Distribution and Inventory Management
BARK currently utilizes global third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from its distribution facilities to support its domestic operations. These logistics providers manage various distribution activities including product receipt, warehousing, assembly, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping.
BARK manages its inventory levels by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, analyzing product ratings, and placing orders with our manufacturers before BARK receives firm orders from customers to ensure sufficient availability.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our rights to our intellectual property, including trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology, are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from competitors. BARK owns a number of trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the United States as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. These registered or pending trademarks include, among others, “Bark,” “BARKBox,” “BARK Bright,” “BARK Food,” “BARK Essentials,” “BARK Super Chewer,” “Super Chewer,” “BARKPOST,” “Destroyers,” “Destroyers Club,” and “Dog People Get It.” The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the 
registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe such registrations would be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous domain names, including www.barkbox.com, www.bark.co, and www.barkshop.com. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both customer terms of use on our website and in agreements with our vendors.
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has significantly contributed to BARK’s success to date. We continually engage with manufacturers to develop and market better quality dog products under our brand names to better serve our customers at a lower price.
Competition
The dog products industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and spread across four primary segments:
•supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and mass merchants;
•specialty pet store chains;
•traditional or neighborhood pet stores; and
•subscription service businesses and e-tailers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in BARK’s market are product selection and quality, customer service, price, brand awareness and loyalty, reliability and trust, convenience, and speed at which orders are delivered to our customers. We believe that BARK differentiates itself from our competitors by the strength of our brand, customer relationships and engagement, proprietary branded products, data-driven design and marketing, and achieving a high level of performance with regard to these competitive factors.
Dog food, in particular, is a highly competitive industry. BARK Food competes with manufacturers of conventional dog food, such as Mars, Nestlé, and Big Heart Pet Brands (part of The J.M. Smucker Company). It also competes with specialty and natural pet food manufacturers such as FreshPet, Colgate-Palmolive, and General Mills. In addition, BARK Food competes with many regional niche brands in individual geographic markets. Given a North American retail landscape dominated by large retailers, with limited shelf space and a significant number of competing products, competitors actively support their brands through marketing, advertising, promotional spending, and discounting. Competitive factors in the dog food industry include product quality, ingredients, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, product packaging and design, reputation, price, advertising, promotion, and nutritional claims. We believe that we have a competitive advantage given the digital nature of our business and our ability to personalize meal plans for each dog that we serve.
The dog health and wellness industry is also highly competitive. BARK Bright competes directly and indirectly with both manufacturers and distributors of pet health and wellness products and online distributors, as well as with veterinarians. BARK Bright directly faces competition from companies that distribute various pet health and wellness products to traditional retailers such as Bayer AG, Central Garden, and Pet Company, Hartz (Unicharm Corp.), Mars, Inc., Manna Pro, Nestlé S.A., Spectrum Holdings, Promika LLC, Tevra Brands, and The J.M. Smucker Company, which are larger than BARK and have greater financial resources. Similarly, BARK Bright faces intense competition from manufacturers who sell dog health and wellness products to e-commerce and other retailers and to veterinarians. We believe we have a competitive advantage with our BARK Bright product as our approach of combining an enzymatic gel, with a hard chew provides better results than many other products on the market.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet. Jurisdictions vary as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales, and other taxes, among other areas, apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information, or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or an inadvertent disclosure of such information. International jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. The continued growth of and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.
In addition, we are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health, natural resources and the environment. Our operations, including our manufacturing outsourcing partners, are subject to regulation by OSHA, the FDA, the USDA, and by various other federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and import of its products, including food safety standards.
