Item 1. Business
General Overview
Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. is a Houston-based energy company which, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Carrizo,” the “Company” or “we”), is actively engaged in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas from resource plays located in the United States. Our current operations are principally focused in proven, producing oil and gas plays in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Permian Basin in West Texas.
Significant Developments in 2018
Acquisitions. On October 17, 2018, we closed on the acquisition with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. (“Devon”), a subsidiary of Devon Energy Corporation, of oil and gas properties in the Delaware Basin in Reeves and Ward counties, Texas (the “Devon Acquisition”). The estimated aggregate purchase price of $196.6 million remains subject to post-closing adjustments. 
Divestitures. In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on divestitures of substantially all of our assets in the Niobrara Formation and a portion of our assets in the Eagle Ford for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $381.3 million. In addition, we could receive contingent consideration of $5.0 million per year if crude oil prices exceed specified thresholds for each of the years of 2018 through 2020 as part of the Niobrara Formation divestiture.
On July 11, 2018, we closed on the divestiture of certain non-operated assets in the Delaware Basin for aggregate net proceeds of $30.9 million. 
See “Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures of Oil and Gas Properties” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Liquidity and financings. On August 17, 2018, we completed a public offering of 9.5 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of $22.55. We used the proceeds of $213.7 million, net of offering costs, to fund the Devon Acquisition and for general corporate purposes. 
We also redeemed the remaining $450.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “7.50% Senior Notes”) and 50,000 shares of our 8.875% redeemable preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”), representing 20% of the then issued and outstanding Preferred Stock. 
During 2018, the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility increased from $830.0 million to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of our continued development of our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets. As of December 31, 2018, our elected commitment amount under our borrowing base was $1.1 billion. 
See “Note 6. Long-Term Debt” and “Note 10. Shareholders’ Equity” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Production. Crude oil production in 2018 was 38,992 Bbls/d, an increase of 13% despite the divestitures in Niobrara and Eagle Ford in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 34,428 Bbls/d in 2017, primarily driven by strong performance from our new wells in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Total production in 2018 was 60,382 Boe/d, an increase of 12% from 53,805 Boe/d in 2017, primarily due to the same reasons discussed above. See “—Summary of 2018 Proved Reserves, Production and Drilling by Area” for further discussion.
5

Proved reserves. At year-end 2018, our proved reserves of 329.4 MMBoe consist of 55% crude oil, 21% natural gas liquids and 24% natural gas. Our reserves increased 67.7 MMBoe, or 26%, from our year-end 2017 proved reserves of 261.7 MMBoe primarily as a result of our ongoing drilling program in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. The following is a summary of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. See “—Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures—Proved Oil and Gas Reserves” for further discussion.

Total | 329.4 | | 261.7


(1) | Included in the December 31, 2017 proved reserves are 10.9 MMBoe associated with a portion of our assets in the Eagle Ford that were divested in January 2018.


(2) | In January 2018, we closed on the divestiture of substantially all of our Niobrara assets.

Recent Developments
Contingent consideration arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the specified pricing thresholds related to the Contingent ExL Consideration, the Contingent Niobrara Consideration, and the Contingent Utica Consideration (each as defined in “Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures of Oil and Gas Properties” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements) were exceeded. As a result, in January 2019, we paid $50.0 million and received $10.0 million from settlement of these contingent consideration arrangements. See “Note 12. Derivative Instruments” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
2019 Drilling, completion, and infrastructure (“DC&I”) capital expenditure plan. Our 2019 DC&I capital expenditure plan is currently $525.0 million to $575.0 million. The assumptions in the 2019 DC&I capital expenditure plan include an expectation that we will achieve an improvement in capital efficiency relative to 2018 resulting from a combination of service cost reductions, efficiency gains, and changes to completion techniques that have already been implemented. We intend to finance our 2019 capital expenditure plan primarily from cash flow from operations and our senior secured revolving credit facility as well as other sources described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Our capital expenditure plan has the flexibility to adjust, should the commodity price environment change. 
The following is a summary of our actual capital expenditures for 2018 and our planned capital expenditures for 2019:

 | Capital Expenditures
 | 2019 Plan (1) | | 2018 Actual
 | (In millions) 
DC&I | | |

Regional Overview 
Eagle Ford Shale
For 2018, the Eagle Ford remained our most significant operational area. Our core Eagle Ford properties are located in LaSalle County and, to a lesser extent, in McMullen, Frio and Atascosa counties in Texas. As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in approximately 91,770 gross (76,462 net) acres. In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on the sale of a portion of our assets in the Eagle Ford to EP Energy E&P Company, L.P. for aggregate net proceeds of $245.7 million. Excluding 1.3 MMBoe of production in 2017 from the divested assets, total Eagle Ford production increased approximately 10% over the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, we spent approximately $522.9 million in the Eagle Ford, which was approximately 19% above our 2018 DC&I capital expenditure plan for the Eagle Ford, due to our decision to shift capital to the Eagle Ford to take advantage of the superior returns that were offered from the play and avoid aggressively developing our Delaware Basin inventory during a period of weak local market pricing. We currently plan for approximately 59% of our 2019 DC&I capital expenditure plan to be directed towards opportunities in the Eagle Ford. 
Delaware Basin
During 2014, we began to build an acreage position in the Delaware Basin in Culberson and Reeves counties, Texas, targeting the Wolfcamp Formation. In the third quarter of 2017, we closed on an acquisition of 16,508 net acres located in Reeves and Ward Counties, Texas from ExL Petroleum Management, LLC and ExL Petroleum Operating Inc. (the “ExL Acquisition”). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed on the Devon Acquisition which added approximately 10,000 net acres. As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in approximately 70,335 gross (46,004 net) acres in the Delaware Basin. Production in the Delaware Basin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 237% from the same period in 2017. Excluding production associated with the Devon 
7

Acquisition, production in the Delaware Basin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 231% as compared to the same period in 2017. In 2018, we spent approximately $321.2 million in the Delaware Basin, which was approximately 4% below our 2018 DC&I capital expenditure plan for the Delaware Basin, due to the capital shift discussed above. We currently plan for approximately 41% of our 2019 DC&I capital expenditure plan to be directed towards opportunities in the Delaware Basin. 
Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures
Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
The following table sets forth summary information with respect to our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 that were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent third party reserve engineers. For further information concerning Ryder Scott’s estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, see the reserve report included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The prices used in the calculation of our estimated proved reserves and PV-10 were based on the average realized prices for sales of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas on the first calendar day of each month during the year (“12-Month Average Realized Price”) in accordance with SEC rules. The following prices were used in the calculation of estimated proved reserves for the respective years.

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
Crude oil ($ per Bbl) | | $63.80 | | | $49.87 | $39.60
NGLs ($ per Bbl) | | $26.15 | | | $19.78 | $11.66
Natural Gas ($ per Mcf) | | $2.46 | | | $2.96 | $1.89 

For further information concerning the present value of estimated future net revenues from these proved reserves, see “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 17. Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See also “—Other Reserve Matters” below for further discussion.

Reconciliation of Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (GAAP) to PV-10 (Non-GAAP)
We believe that the presentation of PV-10 provides greater comparability when evaluating oil and gas companies due to the many factors unique to each individual company that impact the amount and timing of future income taxes. In addition, we believe that PV-10 is widely used by investors and analysts as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other oil and gas companies. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company’s financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The definition of PV-10 as defined in “Item 1. Business—Glossary of Certain Industry Terms” may differ significantly from the definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, PV-10 as defined may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented below. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved oil and gas reserves.

Proved Reserves
The following table provides a summary of the changes in our proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

 | Crude Oil (MBbls) | | NGLs (MBbls) | | Natural Gas (MMcf) | Total (MBoe)
Proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 | 167,374 | | | 42,598 | | 310,470 | | 261,717 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 65,352 | | | 30,195 | | 212,758 | | 131,007 | 
Revisions of previous estimates | (31,287 | ) | | 1,936 | | (6,006 | ) | (30,352 | )
Purchases of reserves in place | 2,205 | | | 967 | | 7,953 | | 4,498 | 
Sales of reserves in place | (9,676 | ) | | (2,872 | ) | (17,475 | ) | (15,461 | )
Production | (14,232 | ) | | (3,701 | ) | (24,639 | ) | (22,040 | )
Proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 | 179,736 | | | 69,123 | | 483,061 | | 329,369 | 

Extensions and discoveries of 131,007 MBoe were comprised of 12,687 MBoe of proved developed reserves and 118,320 MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) that were added through our drilling program and associated offset locations. Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin comprised 30% and 70%, respectively, of the total extensions and discoveries.
Revisions of previous estimates reduced our reserves by 30,352 MBoe. Included in the revisions of previous estimates were the following components;

• | Negative revisions of 21,753 MBoe, primarily in the Eagle Ford, due to changes in our previously approved development plan, which resulted in the timing of development for certain PUD locations to move beyond five years from initial booking. The primary drivers of the changes in our previously approved development plan are the reallocation of capital to areas providing the greatest opportunities to increase capital efficiency and maximize project-level economics within our reduced capital expenditure plan, which includes a shift to larger-scale development projects.


• | Net negative revisions of 12,363 MBoe, primarily due to negative revisions of 14,907 MBoe in the Eagle Ford, partially offset by positive revisions of 2,544 MBoe in the Delaware Basin. The negative revisions in the Eagle Ford were primarily a result of completion of new wells that negatively impacted the production of adjacent existing producing wells and the associated impact to certain PUD locations, as well as a reduction in spacing and the average lateral length for certain PUD locations.


• | Positive revisions due to price of 3,764 MBoe.

Purchases of reserves in place included 4,498 MBoe of proved developed reserves associated with the Devon Acquisition.
Sales of reserves in place included 13,465 MBoe of proved developed reserves and 1,996 MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves associated with the Eagle Ford and Niobrara Formation divestitures.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
The following table provides a summary of the changes in our PUDs for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

 | Crude Oil (MBbls) | | NGLs (MBbls) | | Natural Gas (MMcf) | Total (MBoe)
PUDs as of December 31, 2017 | 97,742 | | | 25,151 | | 179,115 | | 152,745 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 58,373 | | | 27,581 | | 194,196 | | 118,320 | 
Removed due to changes in development plan | (15,847 | ) | | (2,686 | ) | (16,219 | ) | (21,236 | )
Revisions of previous estimates | (9,040 | ) | | 2,274 | | 8,980 | | (5,268 | )
Sales of reserves in place | (1,403 | ) | | (289 | ) | (1,823 | ) | (1,996 | )
Converted to proved developed reserves | (25,356 | ) | | (8,717 | ) | (60,129 | ) | (44,095 | )
PUDs as of December 31, 2018 | 104,469 | | | 43,314 | | 304,120 | | 198,470 | 

Extensions and discoveries of 118,320 MBoe were due to additional offset locations associated with our drilling program, of which 84,399 MBoe were in the Delaware Basin and 33,921 MBoe were in the Eagle Ford. We incurred $36.6 million during 2018 for certain of these PUD locations that were drilled but uncompleted as of December 31, 2018, with $18.7 million incurred in the Eagle Ford and $17.9 million in the Delaware Basin.
We removed 21,236 MBoe of PUDs, primarily in the Eagle Ford, due to changes in our previously approved development plan, which resulted in the timing of development for certain PUD locations to move beyond five years from initial booking. The primary drivers of the changes in our previously approved development plan are the reallocation of capital to areas providing the greatest opportunities to increase capital efficiency and maximize project-level economics within our reduced capital expenditure plan, which includes a shift to larger-scale development projects.
10

Revisions of previous estimates of 5,268 MBoe included 5,917 MBoe of negative revisions, partially offset by 649 MBoe of positive revisions due to pricing. The negative revisions, of which 4,792 MBoe were in the Eagle Ford, were primarily a result of incorporating the impact to estimated future production for certain PUD locations where future completions are adjacent to the respective PUD location, as well as a reduction in spacing and the average lateral length for certain PUD locations. 
Sales of PUDs in place of 1,996 MBoe were related to the sale of a portion of our assets in the Eagle Ford in the first quarter of 2018. We had no PUDs associated with the divestiture in the Niobrara Formation.
We converted 44,095 MBoe of PUDs that were booked as PUDs as of December 31, 2017 to proved developed during 2018, of which 23,181 MBoe were in the Eagle Ford and 20,914 MBoe were in the Delaware Basin, at a total cost of $490.5 million, or $11.12 per Boe. 
We converted an additional 10,430 MBoe of PUDs that were booked as PUDs during 2018 to proved developed, and therefore not included in the table above, of which 5,161 MBoe were in the Eagle Ford and 5,269 MBoe in the Delaware Basin. The total cost to convert these PUDs was $126.6 million, or $12.14 per Boe, of which $79.2 million, or $15.35 per Boe, was in the Eagle Ford and $47.4 million, or $9.00 per Boe, was in the Delaware Basin.
During 2018, we also incurred $68.0 million on PUDs that were drilled but uncompleted as of December 31, 2018 that were booked as PUDs as of December 31, 2017, of which $42.7 million was in the Eagle Ford and $25.3 million was in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2018, we had 25,616 MBoe of PUDs associated with wells that were drilled but uncompleted, 14,430 MBoe of which were in the Eagle Ford and 11,186 MBoe in the Delaware Basin. All of the reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells are scheduled to be completed in 2019. We expect to incur $212.6 million of capital expenditures to complete these wells, with $154.4 million allocated to the Eagle Ford and $58.2 million allocated to the Delaware Basin. 
At December 31, 2018, we did not have any reserves that have remained undeveloped for five or more years since the date of their initial booking and all PUD locations are scheduled to be developed within five years of their initial booking. 
Qualifications of Technical Persons 
In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Ryder Scott estimated 100% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 as presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott does not own an interest in our properties and is not employed on a contingent fee basis.
Our internal reserve engineers each have over 25 years of experience in the petroleum industry and extensive experience in the estimation of reserves and the review of reserve reports prepared by third party engineering firms. The reserve reports are also reviewed by senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, who is a registered petroleum engineer and holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and the Chief Operating Officer, who holds a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimation Process
The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are comprised of technical information, financial data, production data, and ownership interests. All field and reservoir technical information, which is updated annually, is assessed for validity when the internal reserve engineers hold technical meetings with our geoscientists, operations, and land personnel to discuss field performance and to validate future development plans. The other inputs used in the reserve estimation process, including, but not limited to, future capital expenditures, commodity price differentials, production costs, and ownership percentages are subject to internal controls over financial reporting and are assessed for effectiveness annually. 
Our internal reserve engineers work closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the data furnished to Ryder Scott for use in their reserves estimation process. Our internal reserve engineers meet regularly with Ryder Scott to review and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott’s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. The internal reserve engineers review the inputs and assumptions made in the reserves estimates prepared by Ryder Scott and assess them for reasonableness.
Specific internal control procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Review by our internal reserve engineers of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including review of all additions to PUD reserves


• | Quarterly updates by our senior management to our Board of Directors regarding operational data, including production, drilling and completion activity and any significant changes in our reserves estimates


• | Quarterly and annual preparation of a reserve reconciliation that is reviewed by members of our senior management

11


• | Annual review by our senior management of our year-end reserves estimates prepared by Ryder Scott


• | Annual review by our senior management and Board of Directors of our multi-year development plan and approval by the Board of Directors of our capital expenditure plan


• | Review by our senior management of changes, if applicable, in our previously approved development plan

Other Reserve Matters
No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. The reserves data set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future.” 
Our future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We depend on successful exploration, development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future.” Also, the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, or such operator’s breach of the applicable agreements, could adversely impact us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate.”
 The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenue attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil and gas production. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our reserve data and estimated discounted future net cash flows are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future.” There can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated, that the assumed prices will actually be realized for such production or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth our operated and non-operated drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. In the table, “gross” refers to the total wells in which we have a working interest and “net” refers to gross wells multiplied by our working interest therein. As defined by the SEC, the number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. For definitions of exploratory wells, development wells, productive wells, and non-productive wells, see “—Glossary of Certain Industry Terms”.

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016

(1) | All wells included in Other were non-operated wells.

Acreage Data 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our developed and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2018. Developed acreage refers to acreage on which wells have been completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities. Undeveloped acreage refers to acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities whether or not the acreage contains proved reserves.

 | Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage | | Total Acreage | Net Undeveloped Acreage Expiring
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net | 2019 | 2020 | | 2021
Eagle Ford | 76,644 | | 63,970 | | 15,126 | | 12,492 | | 91,770 | | 76,462 | | 3,228 | (1) | 1,499 | (1) | — | 
Delaware Basin | 39,533 | | 28,076 | | 30,802 | | 17,928 | | 70,335 | | 46,004 | | 1,760 | (2) | 11,563 | (2) | 348 | (2)

Total | 118,644 | | 92,450 | | 118,775 | | 73,320 | | 237,419 | | 165,770 | | 7,908 | | 13,062 | | 1,582 | 


(1) | Approximately 100% and 68% of the acreage expiring in 2019 and 2020, respectively, will be developed prior to expiration or extended by lease extension payments. We have no current development plans and no proved undeveloped reserves associated with the remaining acreage as of December 31, 2018.


(2) | Approximately 73%, 6% and 90% of the acreage expiring in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, will be developed prior to expiration or extended by lease extension payments. The acreage expiring in 2020 is primarily in our Alpine High area where, along with the other remaining acreage, we have no current development plans and no proved undeveloped reserves.


(3) | Other includes non-core acreage principally located in Texas, Wyoming, Ohio, and Illinois. We have no current development plans or proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage as of December 31, 2018.

Our lease agreements generally terminate if producing wells have not been drilled on the acreage within their primary term or an extension thereof (a period that can be from three to five years depending on the area). The percentage of net undeveloped acreage expiring in 2019, 2020, and 2021 assumes that no producing wells have been drilled on acreage within their primary term or have been extended. We manage our lease expirations to ensure that we do not experience unintended material expirations. Our leasehold management efforts include scheduling drilling in order to hold leases by production or timely exercising our contractual rights to extend the terms of leases by continuous operations or the payment of lease extension payments and delay rentals. We may choose to allow some leases to expire that are no longer part of our development plans.
The proved undeveloped reserves associated with acreage expiring over the next three years are not material to the Company.

Marketing 
Typically, our production is sold at the wellhead to unaffiliated third party purchasers. Crude oil is sold at prices based on posted prices or NYMEX plus or minus market differentials for the respective area. Natural gas and NGLs are sold under contract at a negotiated price which is based on the market price for the area or at published prices for specified locations or pipelines and then discounted by the purchaser back to the wellhead based upon a number of factors normally considered in the industry (such as distance from the well to the central market location, well pressure, quality of natural gas and prevailing supply and demand conditions). Natural gas is generally delivered to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead or the inlet of the midstream processing entity’s system. The midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds for the resulting sales of NGLs and residue gas. We sell at competitive market prices based on a differential to several market locations. In instances of depressed oil and gas prices, we may elect to shut-in wells until commodity prices are more favorable. We do not believe the loss of any one of our purchasers would materially affect our ability to sell the oil and gas we produce because we believe other purchasers are available in all our areas of operations.
Our marketing objective is to receive competitive wellhead prices for our product. There are a variety of factors that affect the market for oil and gas generally, including:

• | demand for oil and gas;


• | the extent of supply of oil and gas and, in particular, domestic production and imports;


• | the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;


• | the marketing of competitive fuels; and


• | the effects of state and federal regulations on oil and gas production and sales.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Oil and gas prices are highly volatile, and continued low oil and gas prices or further price decreases will negatively affect our financial position, planned capital expenditures and results of operations,” “—We are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations, including those relating to benzene emissions, hydraulic fracturing and global climate change, and future regulations may be more stringent resulting in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce,” and “—If our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell oil and natural gas and receive market prices for our oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints.”
We work with various pipeline companies to procure and to assure capacity for our natural gas. For further discussion of this matter, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—If our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell oil and natural gas and receive market prices for our oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints.” We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing, and transportation contracts with various parties which require us to deliver fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Certain of these contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under these commitments. As of the filing of this report, we do not expect any material shortfalls in our delivery commitments. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” and “Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Competition and Technological Changes
We encounter competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties, obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and services, and recruiting and retaining skilled employees. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have been engaged in the oil and gas business for much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. We may not be able to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment.
The oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Regulation
Oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental regulations that may change from time to time, including regulations governing oil and gas production and transportation, federal and state regulations governing 
15

environmental quality and pollution control and state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit. These regulations may affect the amount of oil and gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other regulated processing and transportation facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. For example, a productive natural gas well may be “shut-in” because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations. State and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and gas, protect rights to produce oil and gas between owners in a common reservoir, control the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production, provide nondiscriminatory access to common carrier pipelines and control contamination of the environment. Pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted.
The following discussion summarizes the regulation of the United States oil and gas industry. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject, although we cannot assure you that this is or will remain the case. Moreover, those statutes, rules, regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions, and any such changes or reinterpretations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject.
Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels that:

• | require permits for the drilling of wells;


• | mandate that we maintain bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; and


• | regulate the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, groundwater sampling requirements prior to drilling, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations.

Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, setback rules, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states (including Texas) rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units and therefore more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws that establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Because these laws and regulations are frequently expanded, amended and reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.
Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas
Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the “Decontrol Act”) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas, including all of our sales of our own production. As a result, all of our domestically produced natural gas is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. The FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation, however, was not affected by the Decontrol Act.
Under the NGA, facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas are exempt from the FERC’s jurisdiction. We own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe satisfy the FERC’s criteria for establishing that these are all gathering facilities not subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. 
One of our pipeline subsidiaries, Hondo Pipeline Inc., may exercise the power of eminent domain and is a regulated public utility within the meaning of Section 101.003 (“GURA”) and Section 121.001 (the “Cox Act”) of the Texas Utilities Code. Both GURA and the Cox Act prohibit unreasonable discrimination in the transportation of natural gas and authorize the Texas Railroad Commission to regulate gas transportation rates. However, GURA provides for negotiated rates with transportation, industrial or similar large-volume contract customers so long as neither party has an unfair negotiating advantage, the negotiated rate is 
16

substantially the same as that negotiated with at least two other customers under similar conditions, or sufficient competition existed when the rate was negotiated.
Although we do not own or operate any pipelines or facilities that are directly regulated by the FERC, its regulations of third-party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to market our production. Beginning in the 1980s, the FERC initiated a series of major restructuring orders that required pipelines, among other things, to perform open access transportation, “unbundle” their sales and transportation functions, and allow shippers to release their pipeline capacity to other shippers. As a result of these changes, sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. It remains to be seen, however, what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business. We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities.
In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation. However, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation or “lighter handed” regulation and the promotion of competition in the gas industry. In light of this increased reliance on competition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the transportation, purchase or sale of natural gas. In addition to the regulations implementing these prohibitions, the FERC has established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through, among other things, expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold and new regulations that require both interstate pipelines and certain non-interstate pipelines to post daily information regarding their design capacity and daily scheduled flow volumes at certain points on their systems. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA and the FERC’s regulations to up to $1.0 million per day for each violation. This maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation.
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates
Our sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to specified conditions and limitations. These regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and NGLs by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. In December 2015, to implement the latest required five-yearly re-determination, the FERC established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. Under FERC’s regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of this indexing system or any new FERC regulations on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations.
There regularly are legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Similarly, we cannot predict whether or to what extent the trend toward federal deregulation of the petroleum industry will continue, or what the ultimate effect on our sales of oil, gas and other petroleum products will be.
17

Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on specified lands within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions prohibiting or limiting the extent of our operations. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of applying more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations to the oil and gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting our profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
We currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we believe that we have generally implemented appropriate operating and waste disposal practices, prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices, and hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we own or lease or on or under locations where such waste has been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other waste was not under our control. These properties and the waste disposed thereon may be subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and gas waste. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. 
We generate waste that may be subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous waste. Furthermore, certain waste generated by our oil and gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as “hazardous waste” may in the future be designated as “hazardous waste” and therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on specified classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These classes of persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
Our operations may be subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements. In 1990 Congress adopted amendments to the Clean Air Act containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states have developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact our production and operations. For example, on October 1, 2015, the EPA released a final rule tightening the primary and secondary NAAQS for ground-level ozone from its 2008 standard levels of 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) to 70 ppb. None of the Texas counties in which we operate have been designated by the EPA as nonattainment areas under this revised standard. However, areas in which we operate could be designated as nonattainment in the future if the EPA were to further reduce ozone standards. States that contain any areas designated nonattainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, are required to develop state implementation plans demonstrating how the area will attain the standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. Similar initiatives could lead to more stringent air permitting, increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local, state, and federal levels. 
18

Additionally, the EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGLs production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) standards for “small” glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. In June 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. In October 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule that would amend certain requirements of the June 2016 rule. Among other things, the proposed rule would reduce monitoring frequencies for fugitive emissions and clarify and streamline certain other requirements. However, the 2016 rule currently remains in effect. Similarly in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued rules requiring additional efforts by producers to reduce venting, flaring, and leaking of natural gas produced on federal and Native American lands. In February 2018, the BLM proposed to repeal certain requirements of the 2016 rules. In September 2018, BLM published a final rule that largely adopted the February 2018 proposal and rescinded several requirements. The September 2018 rule was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California almost immediately after issuance. The challenge is still pending. Compliance with the November 2016 rule or the revised September 2018 rule may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as us, to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore facilities that could be the source of an oil spill into federal or state waters, including wetlands, to post a bond, letter of credit or other form of financial assurance in amounts ranging from $10.0 million in specified state waters to $35.0 million in federal outer continental shelf waters to cover costs that could be incurred by governmental authorities in responding to an oil spill. These financial assurances may be increased by as much as $150.0 million if a formal risk assessment indicates that the increase is warranted. Noncompliance with OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as U.S. waters. Pursuant to the requirements of the CWA, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. Like OPA, the CWA and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to federal regulation and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors-We are subject to various environmental risks and governmental regulations, including those relating to benzene emissions, hydraulic fracturing and global climate change, and future regulations may be more stringent resulting in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce.”
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations are located in or near areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, such as the Attwater’s prairie chicken. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could restrict drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we operate could result in increased costs of or limitations on our ability to perform operations and thus have an adverse effect on our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA, and we are not aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states.
The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced 
19

oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. We believe that we substantially comply with the SDWA and related state provisions.
We also are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Global Climate Change
There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, regulates GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources under the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permitting programs. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards, which will be established by the states or, in some instances, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting rule to apply to the oil and gas source category, including oil and natural gas production facilities and natural gas processing, transmission, distribution and storage facilities. Facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year were required to report annual GHG emissions to the EPA, for the first time by September 28, 2012. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. In October 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule that would amend certain requirements of the June 2016 rule. Among other things, the proposed rule would reduce monitoring frequencies for fugitive emissions and clarify and streamline certain other requirements. However, the 2016 rule currently remains in effect.
The U.S. Congress has considered a number of legislative proposals to restrict GHG emissions and more than 20 states, either individually or as part of regional initiatives, have begun taking actions to control or reduce GHG emissions. Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August of 2017, the United States informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The earliest possible effective withdrawal date from the Paris Agreement is November 2020.
While it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the United States in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs. In addition, existing or new laws, regulations or treaties (including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources) could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas.
In addition to the effects of future regulation, the meteorological effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our operations in the form of more frequent and/or more intense storms and flooding, which could in turn adversely affect our cost of doing business.
Title to Properties
We believe we currently have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in the specific areas in which we operate in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, except where failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in such area, taken as a whole. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty and overriding royalty interests, working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. Additionally, substantially all of our producing properties are subject to mortgage liens securing our obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility. For additional information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.”

Developed acreage. The number of acres allocated or assignable to productive wells or wells capable of production.
Developed oil and gas reserves. Reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or for which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. Development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to (i) gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building and relocating public roads, gas lines and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves, (ii) drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly, (iii) acquire, construct and install, production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems, and (iv) provide improved recovery systems.
Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
Dry well. An exploratory, development or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Economically producible. A resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation.

Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation process using a liquid (usually water with an amount of chemicals mixed in) that is forced into an underground formation under high pressure to open or enlarge fractures in reservoirs with low permeability to stimulate and improve the flow of hydrocarbons from these reservoirs. As the formation is fractured, a proppant (usually sand or ceramics) is pumped into the fractures to “prop” or keep them from closing after they are opened by the liquid. Hydraulic fracturing is a technology used in shale reservoirs and other unconventional resource plays in order to enable commercial hydrocarbon production.

Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Proved developed reserves. Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved reserves. Has the meaning given to such term in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X, which defines proved reserves as:
The quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically, based on prices used to estimate reserves, through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves or PUDs. Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility, based on pricing used to estimate reserves, at greater distances.
23

(ii) Undrilled locations are classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances are estimates for proved undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
PV-10 (Non-GAAP). The present value of estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of estimated net proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, based on prices used in estimating the proved reserves and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax expenses, or depreciation, depletion, and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 percent. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the Company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period. This is a non-GAAP measure. See “Item 1. Business—Additional Oil and Gas Disclosures—Reconciliation of Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (GAAP) to PV-10 (Non-GAAP)”.
Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to EUR with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
Recompletion. The completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed.
Reserves. Estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil or gas, or both, that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
Standardized measure. The present value, discounted at 10%, of future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves after income taxes, calculated holding prices and costs constant at amounts in effect on the date of the report (unless such prices or costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual provisions) and otherwise in accordance with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s rules for inclusion of oil and gas reserve information in financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production.
