Dispositions
Sale of General Partner Interest in TLP
On February 1, 2016, we sold our general partner interest in TLP to ArcLight for net proceeds of $343.1 million. As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting. As discussed further below, TLP is no longer an equity method investment. As part of this transaction, we retained TransMontaigne Product Services LLC, including its marketing business, customer contracts and its line space on the Colonial and Plantation pipelines, which is a significant part of our Refined Products and Renewables segment. We also entered into lease agreements whereby we will remain the long-term exclusive tenant in the TLP Southeast terminal system. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a further discussion.
Sale of TLP Common Units
On April 1, 2016, we sold all of the TLP common units we owned to an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners (“ArcLight”) for approximately $112.4 million in cash. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a further discussion.

As this sale transaction did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results, operations related to this portion of our Crude Oil Logistics segment have not been classified as discontinued operations.
Sawtooth Joint Venture
On March 30, 2018, we completed the transaction to form a joint venture with Magnum Liquids, LLC, a portfolio company of Haddington Ventures LLC, along with Magnum Development, LLC and other Haddington-sponsored investment entities (collectively “Magnum”) to focus on the storage of natural gas liquids and refined products by combining our Sawtooth salt dome storage facility with Magnum’s refined products rights and adjacent leasehold. Magnum acquired an approximately 28.5% interest in Sawtooth from us, in exchange for consideration consisting of a cash payment of approximately $37.6 million (excluding working capital) and the contribution of certain refined products rights and adjacent leasehold. The disposition of this interest was accounted for as an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recorded and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the change in ownership interest of the subsidiary. We own approximately 71.5% of the joint venture; and within the next three years, Magnum has options to acquire our remaining interest for an additional $182.4 million. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a further discussion.
Sale of a Portion of Retail Propane Business

Our Business Strategies
Our principle business objectives are to maximize the profitability and stability of our businesses, grow our businesses in an accretive and prudent manner, and maintain a strong balance sheet, all of which we believe will lead to increasing cash flow available for distributions to our unitholders. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following strategies:

• | Focus on building a vertically integrated midstream master limited partnership providing multiple services to customers. We continue to enhance our ability to transport crude oil from the wellhead to refiners, refined products from refiners to customers, wastewater from the wellhead to treatment for disposal, recycle, or discharge, and natural gas liquids from processing plants to end users, including retail propane customers.


• | Achieve organic growth by investing in new assets that increase volumes, enhance our operations, and generate attractive rates of return. We believe that there are accretive organic growth opportunities that originate from assets we own and operate. We have invested and expect to continue to invest within our existing businesses, particularly within our Crude Oil Logistics and Water Solutions businesses as we grow these businesses with highly accretive, fee-based organic growth opportunities.


• | Deliver accretive growth through strategic acquisitions that complement our existing business model and expand our operations. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that build upon our vertically integrated business model, add scale to our current operating platforms, and enhance our geographic diversity in our businesses. We have established a successful track record of acquiring companies and assets at attractive prices and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in order to capitalize on this strategy in the future.


• | Focus on consistent annual cash flows by adding operations that minimize commodity price risk and generate fee-based, cost-plus, or margin-based revenues under multi-year contracts. We intend to focus on long-term fee-based contracts in addition to back-to-back contracts which minimize commodity price exposure. We continue to increase cash flows that are supported by certain fee-based, multi-year contracts, some of which include acreage dedications from producers or volume commitments.


• | Maintain a disciplined cash distribution policy that complements our leverage, acquisition and organic growth strategies. We target leverage levels that are consistent with those of investment grade companies. We expect to maintain sufficient leverage, liquidity and other credit metrics to manage existing and future capital requirements and to take advantage of market opportunities.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our principal business objectives because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Our vertically integrated and diversified operations, which help us generate more predictable and stable cash flows on a year-to-year basis. Our ability to provide multiple services to customers in numerous geographic areas enhances our competitive position. Our five business units are diversified by geography, customer-base and commodity sensitivities which we believe provides us with the ability to maintain cash flows throughout typical commodity cycles. For example, our Retail Propane business sources propane through our Liquids business which allows us to leverage the expertise of our Liquids business to help improve our margins and profitability and enhance our cash flows. Furthermore, we believe that our Liquids business provides us with valuable market intelligence that helps us identify potential acquisition opportunities. Our Refined Products business benefits from lower energy prices driving increased customer demand, which can offset the downward pressure on our Crude Oil Logistics and Water Solutions businesses in a low price environment.


• | Our network of crude oil transportation assets, which allows us to serve customers over a wide geographic area and optimize sales. Our strategically deployed railcar fleet, towboats, barges, and trucks, and our owned and contracted pipeline capacity, provide access to a wide range of customers and markets. We use this expansive network of transportation assets to deliver crude oil to the optimal markets.


• | Our water processing facilities, which are strategically located near areas of high crude oil and natural gas production. Our water processing facilities are located among the most prolific crude oil and natural gas producing areas in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the DJ Basin, the Eagle Ford shale play, the Bakken shale play, and the Pinedale Anticline. In addition, we believe that the technological capabilities of our Water Solutions business can be quickly implemented at new facilities and locations.

9


• | Our network of natural gas liquids transportation, terminal, and storage assets, which allows us to provide multiple services over the continental United States. Our strategically located terminals, large railcar fleet, shipper status on common carrier pipelines, and substantial leased and owned underground storage enable us to be a preferred purchaser and seller of natural gas liquids.


• | Our high percentage of retail sales to residential customers, who are generally more stable purchasers of propane and distillates and generate higher margins than other customers. Our high percentage of propane tank ownership, payment billing systems, and automatic delivery program have resulted in a strong record of customer retention and help us better predict our cash flows in the Retail Propane business.


• | Our access to refined products pipeline and terminal infrastructure. Our capacity allocations on third-party pipelines and our proprietary access to refined products terminals give us the opportunity to serve customers over a large geographic area.


• | Our seasoned management team with extensive midstream industry experience and a track record of acquiring, integrating, operating and growing successful businesses. Our management team has significant experience managing companies in the energy industry, including master limited partnerships. In addition, through decades of experience, our management team has developed strong business relationships with key industry participants throughout the United States. We believe that our management’s knowledge of the industry, relationships within the industry, and experience in identifying, evaluating and completing acquisitions provides us with opportunities to grow through strategic and accretive acquisitions that complement or expand our existing operations.

Our Businesses
Crude Oil Logistics
Overview. Our Crude Oil Logistics segment purchases crude oil from producers and transports it to refineries or for resale at pipeline injection stations, storage terminals, barge loading facilities, rail facilities, refineries, and other trade hubs, and provides storage, terminaling, trucking, marine and pipeline transportation services through its owned assets. Our operations are centered near areas of high crude oil production, such as the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, the DJ Basin in Colorado, the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, the Anadarko Basin, including the STACK, SCOOP, Granite Wash and Mississippi Lime plays in Oklahoma and Texas, and southern Louisiana at the Gulf of Mexico.
We own a 550-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from its origin in Colorado to Cushing, Oklahoma (the “Grand Mesa Pipeline”). Grand Mesa Pipeline commenced operations on November 1, 2016, and the main line portion of this pipe is comprised of a 37.5% undivided interest in a crude oil pipeline jointly owned with Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC (“Saddlehorn”) where we have the right to utilize 150,000 barrels per day of capacity. During the year ended March 31, 2018, there were approximately 92,000 barrels per day transported on the Grand Mesa Pipeline. Operating costs are allocated to us based on our proportionate ownership interest and throughput. We also own 970,000 barrels of operational tankage related to the Grand Mesa Pipeline.
Through our undivided interest in the Grand Mesa Pipeline, we have capacity sufficient to service our customer contracts at the same origin and termination points with the ability to accept additional volume commitments. We retained ownership of our previously-acquired easements for the potential future development of transportation projects involving petroleum commodities other than crude oil and condensate. With the consent and participation of Saddlehorn, we and Saddlehorn may consider future opportunities using these easements for projects involving the transportation of crude oil and condensate.
Operations. We purchase crude oil from producers and transport it to refineries or for resale. Our strategically deployed railcar fleet, towboats, barges, and trucks, and our owned and contracted pipeline capacity, provide access to a wide range of customers and markets. We use this expansive network of transportation assets to deliver crude oil to the optimal markets.
We currently transport crude oil using the following assets:

• | 163 owned trucks and 260 owned trailers operating primarily in the Mid-Continent, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford shale play, and Rocky Mountain regions;

10


• | 400 owned railcars and 397 leased railcars (of which 291 railcars are subleased to third parties) operating primarily in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington; and


• | 10 owned towboats and 19 owned barges operating primarily in the intercoastal waterways of the Gulf Coast and along the Mississippi and Arkansas river systems.

Of our 400 owned railcars, all are compliant with the standards for railcars built subsequent to 2011. Notwithstanding this, 131 of these owned railcars have been retrofitted to meet United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) Specification 117 regulations (see “Railcar Regulation” below for a further discussion). Another 19 of these owned railcars are expected to be retrofitted by June 30, 2018. Of our 397 leased railcars, 310 are compliant with the standards for railcars built subsequent to 2011 (see Part I, Item 1A–“Risk Factors).
We contract for truck, rail, and barge transportation services from third parties and ship on 21 common carrier pipelines. We own 27 pipeline injection stations, the locations of which are summarized below.

State | Number of Pipeline Injection Stations
Texas | 14 
Oklahoma | 6 
New Mexico | 5 
Kansas | 2 
Total | 27 

We also have commitments on several interstate pipelines for transportation of crude oil.
We own eight storage terminal facilities. The largest of these is a terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma with a storage capacity of 3,600,000 barrels. The combined storage capacity of the other seven terminals is 1,479,400 barrels.
We lease 1,080,000 barrels of capacity at two storage terminal facilities. Of this leased storage capacity, 950,000 barrels are at Cushing, Oklahoma.
On December 22, 2017, we sold our previously held 50% interest in Glass Mountain. Glass Mountain is a 210-mile crude oil pipeline that originates in western Oklahoma and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. This pipeline, which became operational in February 2014, has a capacity of 147,000 barrels per day.
Customers. Our customers include crude oil refiners, producers, and marketers. During the year ended March 31, 2018, 66% of the revenues of our Crude Oil Logistics segment were generated from our ten largest customers of the segment. In addition to utilizing our assets to transport crude oil we own, we also provide truck transportation, barge transportation, storage, and terminal throughput services to our customers.
Competition. Our Crude Oil Logistics business faces significant competition, as many entities are engaged in the crude oil logistics business, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. The primary factors on which we compete are:

• | price;


• | availability of supply;


• | reliability of service;


• | logistics capabilities, including the availability of railcars, proprietary terminals, and owned pipelines, barges, railcars, trucks, and towboats;


• | long-term customer relationships; and


• | the acquisition of businesses.

Supply. We obtain crude oil from a large base of suppliers, which consists primarily of crude oil producers. We currently purchase crude oil from approximately 200 producers at approximately 2,500 leases.
Pricing Policy. Most of our contracts to purchase or sell crude oil are at floating prices that are indexed to published rates in active markets such as Cushing, Oklahoma. We seek to manage price risk by entering into purchase and sale contracts 
11

of similar volumes based on similar indexes and by hedging exposure due to fluctuations in actual volumes and scheduled volumes.
Our profitability is impacted by forward crude oil prices. Crude oil markets can either be in contango (a condition in which forward crude oil prices are greater than spot prices) or can be backwardated (a condition in which forward crude oil prices are lower than spot prices). Our Crude Oil Logistics business benefits when the market is in contango, as increasing prices result in inventory holding gains during the time between when we purchase inventory and when we sell it. In addition, we are able to better utilize our storage assets when contango markets justify storing barrels. When markets are backwardated, falling prices typically have an unfavorable impact on our margins.
Billing and Collection Procedures. Our Crude Oil Logistics customers consist primarily of crude oil refiners, producers, and marketers. We typically invoice these customers on a monthly basis. We perform credit analysis, require credit approvals, establish credit limits, and follow monitoring procedures on these customers. We believe the following procedures enhance our collection efforts with these customers:

• | we require certain customers to prepay or place deposits for our services;


• | we require certain customers to post letters of credit or other forms of surety on a portion of our receivables;


• | we review receivable aging analyses regularly to identify issues or trends that may develop; and


• | we require our marketing personnel to manage their customers’ receivable position and suspend sales to customers that have not timely paid invoices.

Trade Names. Our Crude Oil Logistics segment operates primarily under the NGL Crude Logistics, NGL Crude Transportation and NGL Marine trade names.
Water Solutions
Overview. Our Water Solutions segment provides services for the treatment and disposal of wastewater generated from crude oil and natural gas production and for the disposal of solids such as tank bottoms, drilling fluids and drilling muds and performs truck and frac tank washouts. In addition, our Water Solutions segment sells the recovered hydrocarbons that result from performing these services. Our water processing facilities are strategically located near areas of high crude oil and natural gas production, including the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the DJ Basin in Colorado, the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, and the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we took delivery of 258.2 million barrels of wastewater, an average of 707,000 barrels per day.
Our Water Solutions segment is in the process of expanding its solids disposal business. With the addition of specialized equipment to select facilities in the Eagle Ford shale play, the Permian Basin, and the DJ Basin, we are able to accept and dispose of solids such as tank bottoms, drilling fluids and drilling muds generated by crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Our facilities will accept only exploration and production exempt waste allowed under our current permits.
12

Operations. We own 75 water treatment and disposal facilities, including 100 wells. The location and permitted processing capacities of these facilities and whether the facilities are located on lands we own or lease are summarized below.

 | Number of | Permitted Processing Capacity (barrels per day)
Location | Facilities | Own | | Lease | Total 
Permian Basin (1)(2) - Texas and New Mexico | 32 | | 1,032,500 | | 55,000 | 1,087,500
Eagle Ford (1)(3) - Texas | 24 | | 515,000 | | 291,000 | 806,000 
DJ Basin - Colorado | 12 | | 258,000 | | 135,000 | 393,000 
Bakken - North Dakota | 3 | | 50,000 | | 20,000 | 70,000 
Pinedale Anticline (4) - Wyoming | 1 | | — | | 62,500 | 62,500 
Granite Wash (1) - Texas | 2 | | 60,000 | | — | 60,000 
Eaglebine - Texas | 1 | | 20,000 | | — | 20,000 
Total-All Facilities | 75 | | 1,935,500 | | 563,500 | 2,499,000


(1) | Certain facilities can dispose of both wastewater and solids such as tank bottoms, drilling fluids and drilling muds.


(2) | Includes one facility with a permitted processing capacity of 20,000 barrels per day in which we own a 50% interest.


(3) | Includes one facility with a permitted processing capacity of 40,000 barrels per day in which we own a 75% interest.


(4) | This facility has a permitted capacity of 2,500 barrels per day and a design capacity of 60,000 barrels per day to process water to a recycle standard.

Our customers bring wastewater generated by crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations to our facilities for treatment through pipeline gathering systems and by truck. Our pipeline delivered volumes will continue to increase as new projects come on line. Once we take delivery of the water, the level of processing is determined by the ultimate disposition of the water. Our solids customers bring solids generated by crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations to our facilities by truck.
Our facilities in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota dispose of wastewater primarily into deep underground formations via injection wells.
Our facility servicing the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming has the assets and technology needed to treat the water more extensively than a typical disposal facility. At this facility, the water is recycled, rather than being disposed of in an injection well. We process the water to the point where it can be returned to producers to be reused in future drilling operations (recycle quality water). Recycling offers producers an alternative to the use of fresh water in hydraulic fracturing operations. This minimizes the impact on aquifers, particularly in arid regions of the United States. We also previously treated the water to a greater extent, such that it exceeded the standards for drinking water, and could be returned to the ecosystem (discharge quality water), which operations ceased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Since June 2012, we have recycled approximately 18.5 million barrels (777 million gallons) of recycle quality water, have returned approximately 9.0 million barrels (378 million gallons) of discharge quality water back to New Fork River, which is a tributary of the Colorado River, and have returned approximately 2.6 million barrels (109 million gallons) of water to the ecosystem through an agricultural irrigation system.
At our disposal facilities, we use proprietary well maintenance programs to enhance injection rates and extend the service lives of the wells.
Customers. The customers of our Wyoming and Colorado facilities consist primarily of large exploration and production companies that conduct drilling operations near our facilities. The customers of our Texas and North Dakota facilities consist of both wastewater transportation companies and producers. The primary customer of our Wyoming facility has committed to deliver a specified minimum volume of water to our facility under a long-term contract. The primary customers of our Colorado facilities have committed to deliver all wastewater produced at wells within the DJ Basin to our facilities. One customer in Texas has committed to deliver a minimum volume of 40,000 barrels of wastewater per day to our facilities. Most customers of our other facilities are not under volume commitments, although many of our facilities have acreage dedications or are connected to producer facilities by pipeline. During the year ended March 31, 2018, 16% of the water treatment and disposal revenues of our Water Solutions segment were generated from our two largest customers of the segment, and 47% of the water treatment and disposal revenues of the segment were generated from our ten largest customers of the segment.
13

Competition. We compete with other processors of wastewater to the extent that other processors have facilities geographically close to our facilities. Location is an important consideration for our customers, who seek to minimize the cost of transporting the wastewater to disposal facilities. Our facilities are strategically located near areas of high crude oil and natural gas production. A significant factor affecting the profitability of our Water Solutions segment is the extent of exploration and production in the areas near our facilities, which is generally based upon producers’ expectations about the profitability of drilling new wells.
Pricing Policy. We generally charge customers a fee per barrel of wastewater processed. Certain contracts require the customer to deliver a specified minimum volume of wastewater over a specified period of time. We also generate revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons we recover in the process of treating the wastewater, which we take into consideration in negotiating the processing fees with our customers.
Billing and Collection Procedures. Our Water Solutions customers consist of large exploration and production companies and also water transportation companies. We typically invoice these customers on a monthly basis. We perform credit analysis, require credit approvals, establish credit limits, and follow monitoring procedures on these customers. We believe the following procedures enhance our collection efforts with these customers:

• | we require certain customers to prepay or place deposits for our services;


• | we require certain customers to post letters of credit or other forms of surety on a portion of our receivables;


• | we review receivable aging analyses regularly to identify issues or trends that may develop; and


• | we require our marketing personnel to manage their customers’ receivable position and suspend service to customers that have not timely paid invoices.

Trade Names. Our Water Solutions segment operates primarily under the NGL Water Solutions and Anticline Disposal trade names.
Technology. We hold multiple patents for processing technologies. We believe that the technological capabilities of our Water Solutions business can be quickly implemented at new facilities and locations.
Liquids
Overview. Our Liquids segment provides natural gas liquids procurement, storage, transportation, and supply services to customers through assets owned by us and third parties. Our Liquids business supplies the majority of the propane for our Retail Propane business as well as other retail propane businesses. We also sell butanes and natural gasolines to refiners and producers for use as blending stocks and diluent and assist refineries by managing their seasonal butane supply needs. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 2.3 billion gallons of natural gas liquids, an average of 6.32 million gallons per day.
Operations. We procure natural gas liquids from refiners, gas processing plants, producers and other resellers for delivery to leased or owned storage space, common carrier pipelines, railcar terminals, and direct to certain customers. Our customers take delivery by loading natural gas liquids into transport vehicles from common carrier pipeline terminals, private terminals, our terminals, directly from refineries and rail terminals, and by railcar.
A portion of our wholesale propane gallons are presold to third-party retailers and wholesalers at a fixed price under back-to-back contracts. Back-to-back contracts, in which we balance our contractual portfolio by buying physical propane supply or derivatives when we have a matching purchase commitment from our wholesale customers, protect our margins and mitigate commodity price risk. Presales also reduce the impact of warm weather because the customer is required to take delivery of the propane regardless of the weather or any other factors. We generally require cash deposits from these customers. In addition, on a daily basis we have the ability to balance our inventory by buying or selling propane, butanes, and natural gasoline to refiners, resellers, and propane producers through pipeline inventory transfers at major storage hubs.
In order to secure consistent supply during the heating season, we are often required to purchase volumes of propane during the entire fiscal year. In order to mitigate storage costs and price risk, we may sell those volumes at a lesser margin than we earn in our other wholesale operations.
We purchase butane from refiners during the summer months, when refiners have a greater butane supply than they need, and sell butane to refiners during the winter blending season, when demand for butane is higher. We utilize a portion of our railcar fleet and a portion of our leased underground storage to store butane for this purpose.
14

We also transport customer-owned natural gas liquids on our leased railcars and charge the customers a transportation service fee as well as subleasing railcars to certain customers.
We own 21 natural gas liquids terminals and we lease a fleet of approximately 4,500 high-pressure and general purpose railcars (of which 175 railcars are subleased to third parties). These assets give us the opportunity to access wholesale markets throughout the United States, and to move product to locations where demand is highest. We utilize these terminals and railcars primarily in the service of our wholesale propane, butane and asphalt operations, although we also provide transportation, storage, and throughput services to other parties to a lesser extent.
The location of the facilities and their throughput capacity are summarized below.

We have operating agreements with third parties for certain of our terminals. The terminals in East St. Louis, Illinois and Jefferson City, Missouri are operated for us by a third party for a monthly fee under an operating and maintenance agreement that expires in November 2022. The terminal in St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada is operated by a third party under a year-to-year agreement.
We own the land on which 14 of the 21 natural gas liquids terminals are located and we either have easements or lease the land on which the remaining terminals are located. The terminals in East St. Louis, Illinois and Jefferson City, Missouri have perpetual easements, and the terminal in St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada has a long-term lease that expires in 2022.
We are the majority owner of an underground storage facility near Delta, Utah. This facility currently has capacity to store approximately 6.0 million barrels of natural gas liquids and refined products. We lease storage to approximately 16 customers, with lease terms ranging from one to three years. The facility is located on property for which we have a long-term lease.
We own a natural gas liquids terminal that supports refined products blending in Port Hudson, Louisiana, and a natural gas liquids and condensate facility in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The Port Hudson Terminal is located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is in proximity to other refined products infrastructure along the Colonial pipeline. This truck unloading and storage facility allows for the aggregation and supply of butane and naphtha for motor fuel blending and consists of storage tanks with total capacity of 720,000 gallons. The Kingfisher Facility is a natural gas liquids and condensate facility located in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, which is located in the middle of the STACK production region. The facility connects to the Chisholm NGL pipeline and the Conway Fractionation complex and consists of 450,000 gallons of storage capacity, a methanol extraction tower and a 5,000-barrel per day condensate splitter. 
15

We own 23 transloading units, which enable customers to transfer product from railcars to trucks. These transloading units can be moved to locations along a railroad where it is most convenient for customers to transfer their product. 
We lease natural gas liquids storage space to accommodate the supply requirements and contractual needs of our retail and wholesale customers. We lease storage space for natural gas liquids in various storage hubs in Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas and Canada.
The following table summarizes our significant leased storage space at natural gas liquids storage facilities and interconnects to those facilities:

Customers. Our Liquids business serves approximately 900 customers in 48 states. Our Liquids business serves national, regional and independent retail, industrial, wholesale, petrochemical, refiner and natural gas liquids production customers. Our Liquids business also supplies the majority of the propane for our Retail Propane business. We deliver the propane supply to our customers at terminals located on common carrier pipelines, rail terminals, refineries, and major United States propane storage hubs. During the year ended March 31, 2018, 27% of the revenues of our Liquids segment were generated from our ten largest customers of the segment (exclusive of sales to our Retail Propane segment).
Seasonality. Our wholesale Liquids business is affected by the weather in a similar manner as our Retail Propane business as discussed below. However, we are able to partially mitigate the effects of seasonality by preselling a portion of our wholesale volumes to retailers and wholesalers and requiring the customer to take delivery of the product regardless of the weather.
Competition. Our Liquids business faces significant competition, as many entities, including other natural gas liquids wholesalers and companies involved in the natural gas liquids midstream industry (such as terminal and refinery operations), are engaged in the liquids business, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. The primary factors on which we compete are:

• | price;


• | availability of supply;


• | reliability of service;


• | available space on common carrier pipelines;


• | storage availability;


• | logistics capabilities, including the availability of railcars, and proprietary terminals;

16


• | long-term customer relationships; and


• | the acquisition of businesses.

Pricing Policy. In our Liquids business, we offer our customers three categories of contracts for propane sourced from common carrier pipelines:

• | customer pre-buys, which typically require deposits based on market pricing conditions;


• | market based, which can either be a posted price or an index to spot price at time of delivery; and


• | load package, a firm price agreement for customers seeking to purchase specific volumes delivered during a specific time period.

We use back-to-back contracts for many of our Liquids segment sales to limit exposure to commodity price risk and protect our margins. We are able to match our supply and sales commitments by offering our customers purchase contracts with flexible price, location, storage, and ratable delivery. However, certain common carrier pipelines require us to keep minimum in-line inventory balances year round to conduct our daily business, and these volumes are not matched with a sales commitment.
We generally require deposits from our customers for fixed price future delivery of propane if the delivery date is more than 30 days after the time of contractual agreement.
Billing and Collection Procedures. Our Liquids segment customers consist of commercial accounts varying in size from local independent distributors to large regional and national retailers. These sales tend to be large volume transactions that can range from 10,000 gallons up to 1,000,000 gallons, and deliveries can occur over time periods extending from days to as long as a year. We perform credit analysis, require credit approvals, establish credit limits, and follow monitoring procedures on these customers. We believe the following procedures enhance our collection efforts with these customers:

• | we require certain customers to prepay or place deposits for their purchases;


• | we require certain customers to post letters of credit or other forms of surety on a portion of our receivables;


• | we require certain customers to take delivery of their contracted volume ratably to help control the account balance rather than allowing them to take delivery of propane at their discretion;


• | we review receivable aging analysis regularly to identify issues or trends that may develop; and


• | we require our marketing personnel to manage their customers’ receivable position and suspend sales to customers that have not timely paid invoices.

Trade Names. Our Liquids segment operates primarily under the NGL Supply Wholesale, NGL Supply Terminal Company, Sawtooth Caverns, Centennial Energy, and Centennial Gas Liquids trade names.
Retail Propane
Overview. Our Retail Propane segment consists of the retail marketing, sale and distribution of propane and distillates, including the sale and lease of propane tanks, equipment and supplies, to more than 320,000 residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial customers. We also sell propane to certain resellers. We purchase the majority of the propane sold in our Retail Propane business from our Liquids business, which provides our Retail Propane business with a stable and secure supply of propane. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 234.6 million gallons of propane and distillates, an average of 643,000 gallons per day. On March 30, 2018, we sold a portion of our Retail Propane segment (see “Dispositions” above), which accounted for 67.8 million gallons, or 29%, of propane sold during the year ended March 31, 2018.
Operations. We market retail propane and distillates through our customer service locations. We sell propane primarily in rural areas, but we also have a number of customers in suburban areas where energy alternatives to propane such as natural gas are not generally available. We own or lease 91 customer service locations and 72 satellite distribution locations, with aggregate propane storage capacity of 13.0 million gallons and aggregate distillate storage capacity of 5.7 million gallons. Our customer service locations are staffed and operated to service a defined geographic market area and typically include a business office, product showroom, and secondary propane storage. Our satellite distribution locations, which are unmanned storage tanks, allow our customer service centers to serve an extended market area.
17

The following table summarizes the number of our customer service locations and satellite distribution locations by state:

State | Number of CustomerService Locations | Number of SatelliteDistribution Locations
Georgia | 27 | | 11
Massachusetts | 14 | | 10
North Carolina | 13 | | 15
Maine | 11 | | 10
Pennsylvania | 9 | | 5 
New Hampshire | 6 | | 7 
Connecticut | 3 | | 3 
South Carolina | 2 | | 2 
Alabama | 1 | | 1 
Florida | 1 | | — 
Maryland | 1 | | 1 
New Jersey | 1 | | 2 
Rhode Island | 1 | | 1 
Tennessee | 1 | | 1 
Vermont | — | | 3 
Total | 91 | | 72


We own 57 of our 91 customer service locations and 36 of our 72 satellite distribution locations, and we lease the remainder.
Tank ownership at customer locations is an important component to our operations and customer retention. At March 31, 2018, we owned the following propane storage tanks:

• | over 300 bulk storage tanks with capacities ranging from 18,000 to 90,000 gallons; and


• | over 350,000 stationary customer storage tanks with capacities ranging from 7 to 30,000 gallons.

We also lease an additional 16 bulk storage tanks ranging from 5,000 to 61,500 gallons.
At March 31, 2018, we owned a fleet of 480 bulk delivery trucks, 30 semi-tractors, 30 propane transport trailers and 475 other service trucks.
Retail deliveries of propane are usually made to customers by means of our fleet of bulk delivery trucks. Propane is pumped from the bulk delivery truck, which holds from 2,200 to 5,000 gallons, into a storage tank at the customer’s premises. The capacity of these storage tanks ranges from 50 to 30,000 gallons. We also deliver propane to retail customers in portable cylinders, which typically have a capacity of 5 to 25 gallons. These cylinders are either picked up on a delivery route, refilled at our customer service locations, and then returned to the retail customer, or refilled at the customer’s location. Customers can also bring the cylinders to our customer service centers to be refilled.
Approximately 72% of our residential customers receive their propane supply via our automatic route delivery program, which allows us to maximize our delivery efficiency. For these customers, our delivery forecasting software system utilizes a customer’s historical consumption patterns combined with current weather conditions to more accurately predict the optimal time to refill the customer’s tank. The delivery information is then uploaded to routing software to calculate the most cost effective delivery route. Our automatic delivery program promotes customer retention by providing an uninterrupted supply of propane and enables us to efficiently conduct route deliveries on a regular basis. Some of our purchase plans, such as level payment billing, fixed price, and price cap programs, further promote our automatic delivery program.
18

Customers. Our retail propane and distillate customers fall into three broad categories: residential, commercial and industrial, and agricultural. At March 31, 2018, our retail propane and distillate customers were comprised of:

• | 68% residential customers;


• | 31% commercial and industrial customers; and


• | 1% agricultural customers.

No single customer accounted for more than 1% of our retail propane volumes during the year ended March 31, 2018.
Seasonality. The retail propane and distillate business is largely seasonal due to the primary use of propane and distillates as heating fuels. In particular, residential and agricultural customers who use propane and distillates to heat homes and livestock buildings generally only need to purchase propane during the typical fall and winter heating season. Propane sales to agricultural customers who use propane for crop drying are also seasonal, although the impact on our retail propane volumes sold varies from year to year depending on the moisture content of the crop and the ambient temperature at the time of harvest. Propane and distillate sales to commercial and industrial customers, while affected by economic patterns, are not as seasonal as sales to residential and agricultural customers.
Competition. Our Retail Propane business faces significant competition, as many entities are engaged in the retail propane business, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. Also, we compete with alternative energy sources, including natural gas and electricity. The primary factors on which we compete are:

• | price;


• | availability of supply;


• | reliability of service;


• | long-term customer relationships; and


• | the acquisition of businesses.

Competition with other retail propane distributors in the propane industry is highly fragmented and generally occurs on a local basis with other large full-service, multi-state propane marketers, smaller local independent marketers, and farm cooperatives. Our customer service locations generally have one to five competitors in their market area.
The competitive landscape of the markets that we serve has been fairly stable. Each customer service location operates in its own competitive environment, since retailers are located in close proximity to their customers due to delivery economics. Our customer service locations generally have an effective marketing radius of 25 to 55 miles, although in certain areas the marketing radius may be extended by satellite distribution locations.
The ability to compete effectively depends on the ability to provide superior customer service, which includes reliability of supply, quality equipment, well-trained service staff, efficient delivery, 24-hours-a-day service for emergency repairs and deliveries, multiple payment and purchase options and the ability to maintain competitive prices. Additionally, we believe that our safety programs, policies and procedures are more comprehensive than many of our smaller, independent competitors, which offers a higher level of service to our customers. We also believe that our overall service capabilities and customer responsiveness differentiate us from many of our competitors.
Supply. Our Retail Propane segment purchases the majority of its propane from our Liquids segment.
Pricing Policy. Our pricing policy is an essential element in the successful marketing of retail propane and distillates. We protect our margin by adjusting our retail propane pricing based on, among other things, prevailing supply costs, local market conditions, and input from management at our customer service locations. We rely on our regional management to set prices based on these factors. Our regional managers are advised regularly of any changes in the delivered cost of propane and distillates, potential supply disruptions, changes in industry inventory levels, and possible trends in the future cost of propane and distillates. We believe the market intelligence provided by our Liquids segment, combined with our propane and distillate pricing methods allows us to respond to changes in supply costs in a manner that protects our customer base and our margins.
19

Billing and Collection Procedures. In our Retail Propane business, our customer service locations are typically responsible for customer billing and account collection. We believe that this decentralized and more personal approach is beneficial because our local staff has more detailed knowledge of our customers, their needs, and their history than would an employee at a remote billing center. Our local staff often develops relationships with our customers that are beneficial in reducing payment time for a number of reasons:

• | customers are billed on a timely basis;


• | customers tend to keep accounts receivable balances current when paying a local business and people they know;


• | many customers prefer the convenience of paying in person; and


• | billing issues may be handled more quickly because local personnel have current account information and detailed customer history available to them at all times to answer customer inquiries.

Our Retail Propane customers must comply with our standards for extending credit, which typically includes submitting a credit application, supplying credit references, and undergoing a credit check with an appropriate credit agency.
Trade Names. We use a variety of trademarks and trade names that we own, including Anthem Propane Exchange, Brantley Gas, Coastal Energy, Downeast Energy, Eastern Propane, Gas Inc., Lumber River Propane, Osterman Propane, Proflame, Stallings Propane, Stiles Fuels, Stokes & Congleton, Carolina Energies, Triad Propane, Woodstock Gas, Yadkin Propane and Propane Services, among others. We typically retain and continue to use the names of the companies that we acquire and believe that this helps maintain the local identification of these companies and contributes to their continued success. We regard our trademarks, trade names, and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products.
Refined Products and Renewables
Overview. Our Refined Products and Renewables segment conducts gasoline, diesel, ethanol, and biodiesel marketing operations. In addition, in certain storage locations, our Refined Products and Renewables segment may also purchase unfinished gasoline blending components for subsequent blending into finished gasoline to supply our marketing business as well as third parties. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we sold 108.4 million barrels of gasoline, 56.0 million barrels of diesel, 3.4 million barrels of ethanol and 2.1 million barrels of biodiesel.
Operations. The refined products we handle include gasoline, diesel, and heating oil. We purchase refined petroleum and renewable products primarily in the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States and schedule them for delivery at various locations throughout the country. On certain interstate refined products pipelines, shipment demand exceeds available capacity, and capacity is allocated to shippers based on their historical shipment volumes. We hold allocated capacity on the Colonial and Plantation pipelines.
A significant percentage of our business is priced on a back-to-back basis which minimizes our commodity price exposure. We sell our products to commercial and industrial end users, independent retailers, distributors, marketers, government entities, and other wholesalers of refined petroleum products. We sell our products at terminals owned by third parties. As discussed in “Dispositions” above, on February 1, 2016, we sold our general partner interest in TLP. As a result, on February 1, 2016, we deconsolidated TLP and began to account for our limited partner investment in TLP using the equity method of accounting. As part of this transaction, we retained TransMontaigne Product Services LLC, including its marketing business, customer contracts and its line space on the Colonial and Plantation pipelines, which is a significant part of our Refined Products and Renewables segment. We also entered into lease agreements whereby we will remain the long-term exclusive tenant in the TLP Southeast terminal system.

Total Facilities Storage Capacity | 9,898,516 


(1) | Includes 1,067,900 barrels of capacity that is subleased to third parties.

We purchase ethanol primarily at production facilities in the Midwest and transport the ethanol via trucks and railcars for sale at various locations. We also blend ethanol into gasoline for sale to customers at third party terminals. We market and handle logistics for third-party ethanol manufacturers for a service fee. We primarily purchase biodiesel from production facilities in the Midwest and in Houston, Texas, and transport the biodiesel via railcar to sell to customers. We lease a total of 12,000 barrels of biodiesel storage in Deer Park, Texas and have a biodiesel terminaling agreement at a fuel terminal in Phoenix, Arizona with a minimum monthly throughput requirement. We lease 346 railcars for the transportation of renewables, of which 299 railcars are subleased to a third party.
Customers. Our Refined Products and Renewables segment serves customers in 38 states. During the year ended March 31, 2018, 35% of the revenues of our Refined Products and Renewables segment were generated from our ten largest customers of the segment. We sell to customers via rack spot sales, contract sales, bulk sales, and just-in-time sales.
Contract sales are made pursuant to negotiated contracts, generally ranging from one to twelve months in duration, that we enter into with local market wholesalers, independent gasoline station chains, heating oil suppliers, and other customers. Contract sales provide these customers with a specified volume of product during the term of the agreement. Delivery of product sold under these arrangements generally is at third party truck racks. The pricing of the product delivered under a majority of our contract sales is based on published index prices, and varies based on changes in the applicable indices. In addition, at the customer’s option, the contract price may be fixed at a stipulated price per gallon.
Rack spot sales are sales that do not involve continuing contractual obligations to purchase or deliver product. Rack spot sales are priced and delivered on a daily basis through truck loading racks. At the end of each day for each of the terminals that we market from, we establish the next day selling price for each product for each of our delivery locations. We announce or “post” to customers via website, e-mail, and telephone communications the rack spot sale price of various products for the following morning. Typical rack spot sale purchasers include commercial and industrial end users, independent retailers and small, independent marketers who resell product to retail gasoline stations or other end users. Our selling price of a particular product on a particular day is a function of our supply at that delivery location or terminal, our estimate of the costs to replenish the product at that delivery location, and our desire to reduce inventory levels at that particular location that day.
21

Bulk sales generally involve the sale of products in large quantities in the major cash markets including the Houston Gulf Coast and New York Harbor. A bulk sale of products also may be made while the product is being transported on common carrier pipelines.
We conduct just-in-time sales at a nationwide network of terminals owned by third parties. We post prices at each of these locations on a daily basis. When customers decide to purchase product from us, we purchase the same volume of product from a supplier at a previously agreed-upon price. For these just-in-time transactions, our purchase from the supplier occurs at the same time as our sale to our customer.
Seasonality. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. However, the demand for diesel typically peaks during the fall and winter months due to colder temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast.
Competition. Our Refined Products and Renewables business faces significant competition, as many entities are engaged in the refined products and renewables business, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. The primary factors on which we compete are:

• | price;


• | availability of supply;


• | reliability of service;


• | available space on common carrier pipelines;


• | storage availability;


• | logistics capabilities, including the availability of railcars, and proprietary terminals; and


• | long-term customer relationships.

Market Price Risk. Our philosophy is to maintain minimum commodity price exposure through a combination of purchase contracts, sales contracts and financial derivatives. A significant percentage of our business is priced on a back-to-back basis which minimizes our commodity price exposure. For discretionary inventory, and for those instances where physical transactions cannot be appropriately matched, we utilize financial derivatives to mitigate commodity price exposure. Specific exposure limits are mandated in our credit agreement and in our market risk policy.
The value of refined products in any local delivery market is the sum of the commodity price as reflected on the NYMEX and the basis differential for that local delivery market. The basis differential for any local delivery market is the spread between the cash price in the physical market and the quoted price in the futures markets for the prompt month. We typically utilize NYMEX futures contracts to mitigate commodity price exposure. We generally do not manage the financial impact on us from changes in basis differentials affected by local market supply and demand disruptions.
Legal and Regulatory Considerations. Demand for ethanol and biodiesel is driven in large part by government mandates and incentives. Refiners and producers are required to blend a certain percentage of renewables into their refined products, although the percentage can vary from year to year based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) mandates. In addition, the federal government has in recent years granted certain tax credits for the use of biodiesel, although on several occasions these tax credits have expired. In February 2018, the federal government passed a law to reinstate the tax credit retroactively to January 1, 2017, with the credit expiring on December 31, 2017. Changes in future mandates and incentives, or decisions by the federal government related to future reinstatement of the biodiesel tax credit, could result in changes in demand for ethanol and biodiesel.
Billing and Collection Procedures. Our Refined Products and Renewables customers consist primarily of commercial and industrial end users, independent retailers, distributors, marketers, government entities, and other wholesalers of refined petroleum products. We perform credit analysis, require credit approvals, establish credit limits, and follow monitoring procedures on our Refined Products and Renewables customers. We believe the following procedures enhance our collection efforts with our customers:

• | we require certain customers to prepay or place deposits for our services;


• | we require certain customers to post letters of credit or other forms of surety on a portion of our receivables;

22


• | we monitor individual customer receivables relative to previously-approved credit limits, and our automated rack delivery system gives us the option to discontinue providing product to customers when they exceed their credit limits;


• | we review receivable aging analyses regularly to identify issues or trends that may develop; and


• | we require our marketing personnel to manage their customers’ receivable position and suspend sales to customers that have not timely paid invoices.

Trade Names. Our Refined Products and Renewables segment operates primarily under the NGL Crude Logistics and TransMontaigne Product Services LLC trade names.
Employees
At March 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,400 full-time employees. Thirty eight of our employees at three of our locations are members of a labor union. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Government Regulation
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industries
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Production and Sales. Sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In 1989, the United States Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), which has authority under the Natural Gas Act to regulate the prices and other terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all natural gas resellers subject to its regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. Either Congress or the FERC (with respect to the resale of natural gas in interstate commerce), however, could re-impose price controls in the future.
Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local regulation, including, but not limited to, permitting, well location, methods of drilling, well operations, and conservation of resources. While these regulations do not directly apply to our business, they may affect the businesses of certain of our customers and suppliers and thereby indirectly affect our business.
Regulation of the Transportation and Storage of Natural Gas and Oil and Related Facilities. The FERC regulates oil pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act and natural gas pipeline and storage companies under the Natural Gas Act, and Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “NGPA”), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Grand Mesa Pipeline became operational on November 1, 2016 and has several points of origin in Colorado, runs from those origin points through Kansas and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. The transportation services on the Grand Mesa Pipeline are subject to FERC regulation. In February 2018, the FERC issued a revised policy to disallow income tax allowance cost recovery in rates charged by pipeline companies organized as master limited partnerships. The FERC’s revised policy impacts cost-of-service rates on oil pipelines. Currently, the volumes of crude oil that are transported on the Grand Mesa Pipeline are subject to contractual agreements. Therefore, the FERC’s revised policy is not expected to impact the Grand Mesa Pipeline at the present time. Additionally, contracts we enter into for the interstate transportation or storage of crude oil or natural gas may be subject to FERC regulation including reporting or other requirements. In addition, the intrastate transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas is subject to regulation by the state in which such facilities are located, and such regulation can affect the availability and price of our supply, and have both a direct and indirect effect on our business.
Anti-Market Manipulation. We are subject to the anti-market manipulation provisions in the Natural Gas Act and the NGPA, which authorizes the FERC to impose fines of up to $1 million per day per violation of the Natural Gas Act, the NGPA, or their implementing regulations. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) holds statutory authority under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to prevent market manipulation in petroleum markets, including the authority to request that a court impose fines of up to $1 million per violation. These agencies have promulgated broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is directed under the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to statutory authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1 million per day per violation or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market 
23

manipulation sections of the Commodity Exchange Act. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation.
Maritime Transportation. The Jones Act is a federal law that restricts maritime transportation between locations in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States and owned and manned by United States citizens. Since we engage in maritime transportation through our barge fleet between locations in the United States, we are subject to the provisions of the law. As a result, we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our subsidiaries that engage in maritime transportation and for taking any remedial action necessary to ensure that no violation of the Jones Act ownership restrictions occurs. The Jones Act also requires that all United States-flagged vessels be manned by United States citizens. Foreign-flagged seamen generally receive lower wages and benefits than those received by United States citizen seamen. This requirement significantly increases operating costs of United States-flagged vessel operations compared to foreign-flagged vessel operations. Certain foreign governments subsidize their nations’ shipyards. This results in lower shipyard costs both for new vessels and repairs than those paid by United States-flagged vessel owners. The United States Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regimen of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for United States-flagged operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience.
Environmental Regulation
General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Accordingly, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate or imposing additional costs on our operations;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying construction or system modification or upgrades during permit issuance or renewal;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits or permit requirements issued pursuant to or imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances such as hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.
The following is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste. We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the storage, distribution and transportation of natural gas liquids and the operation of bulk storage liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) terminals, as well as laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including those addressing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Generally, these laws (i) regulate air and water quality and impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes; (ii) subject our operations to certain permitting and registration requirements; (iii) may result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (iv) impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or ongoing operations; and (vi) may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with such laws. These laws include, among others, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the federal Clean Air Act, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and comparable state statutes. For example, as a flammable substance, propane is subject to risk management plan requirements under section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act.
24

CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, and similar state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. While natural gas liquids are not a hazardous substance within the meaning of CERCLA, other chemicals used in or generated by our operations may be classified as hazardous. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
RCRA, and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Certain wastes associated with the production of oil and natural gas, as well as certain types of petroleum-contaminated media and debris, are excluded from regulation as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible, however, that certain wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to implement remedial measures to prevent or mitigate future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Oil Pollution Prevention. Our operations involve the shipment of crude oil by barge through navigable waters of the United States. The Oil Pollution Prevention Act imposes liability for releases of crude oil from vessels or facilities into navigable waters. If a release of crude oil to navigable waters occurred during shipment or from a terminal, we could be subject to liability under the Oil Pollution Prevention Act. We are not currently aware of any facts, events, or conditions related to oil spills that could materially impact our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In 1973, the EPA adopted oil pollution prevention regulations under the Clean Water Act. These oil pollution prevention regulations, as amended several times since their original adoption, require the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming crude oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility’s operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility’s SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security, and training. Most importantly, the facility must fully implement the SPCC plan and train personnel in its execution. We maintain and implement such plans for our facilities.
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits prior to the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. Furthermore, we may be 
25

required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the United States and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. SPCC requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon or other constituent tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. We have discharge permits in place for a number of our facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from such facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Underground Injection Control. Our underground injection operations are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, as well as analogous state laws and regulations, which establish requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping, and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our permits, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries.
Hydraulic Fracturing. The underground injection of crude oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control Program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. We do not conduct any hydraulic fracturing activities. However, a portion of our customers’ crude oil and natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process and our Water Solutions business treats and disposes of wastewater generated from natural gas production, including production utilizing hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate oil and gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Congress will likely continue to consider legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under the Act’s Underground Injection Control Program and/or to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Federal agencies, including the EPA and the United States Department of the Interior, have asserted their regulatory authority to, for example, study the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on the environment, and initiate rulemakings to compel disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, and establish pretreatment standards for wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, some states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, which include additional permit requirements, public disclosure of fracturing fluid contents, operational restrictions, and/or temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. We expect that scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities will continue in the future.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation
There is a growing concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions, most notably carbon dioxide, to global warming. For example, Sen. Charles Van Hollen, Jr. (D-MD) introduced the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act of 2018 in the Senate on January 29, 2018 as S. 2352, and Rep. Donald Beyer (D-VA) introduced the same bill in the House of Representatives that same day as H.R. 4889. The bills would impose a cap on greenhouse gas emissions through requirement to purchase carbon permits and distribute the proceeds of such purchases to eligible individuals. The ultimate outcome of any possible future federal legislative initiatives is uncertain. In addition, several states have already adopted some legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs.
On December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings allowed 
26

the EPA to adopt and implement regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. On May 12, 2016, the EPA finalized three rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which became effective on August 2, 2016. On April 18, 2017, the EPA announced its intention to reconsider certain aspects of these rules in response to several administrative reconsideration opinions. On June 12, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking that would stay for two years with various requirements of the rule while the EPA reconsiders them. The schedule for when this rulemaking could be finalized is not presently known. The EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and also could adversely affect demand for the products that we transport, store, process, or otherwise handle in connection with our services.
Some scientists have suggested climate change from greenhouse gases could increase the severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods, which could damage our facilities. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for our natural gas liquids is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for our products and services. If there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.
Because propane is considered a clean alternative fuel under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, new climate change regulations may provide us with a competitive advantage over other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and coal.
The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations, including greenhouse gas regulation, could continue, resulting in increased costs of conducting business and consequently affecting our profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts certain aspects of our business or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
Safety and Transportation
All states in which we operate have adopted fire safety codes that regulate the storage and distribution of propane and distillates. In some states, state agencies administer these laws. In others, municipalities administer them. We conduct training programs to help ensure that our operations comply with applicable governmental regulations. With respect to general operations, each state in which we operate adopts National Fire Protection Association, Pamphlet Nos. 54 and 58, or comparable regulations, which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane, and Pamphlet Nos. 30, 30A, 31, 385, and 395 which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of distillates, such as fuel oil. We believe that the policies and procedures currently in effect at all of our facilities for the handling, storage and distribution of propane and distillates and related service and installation operations are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental, health and safety laws.
With respect to the transportation of propane, distillates, crude oil, and water, we are subject to regulations promulgated under federal legislation, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Regulations under these statutes cover the security and transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the DOT. Specifically, crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“HLPSA”), which requires PHMSA to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the storage and transportation of hazardous liquids by and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. HLPSA covers petroleum and petroleum products and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the United States Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations.
The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, established safety standards for certain “regulated gathering lines,” and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in high consequence areas (“HCAs”), defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain United States crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. In January 2012, the federal government passed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). This act provides for additional regulatory oversight of the nation’s pipelines, 
27

increases the penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules, and complements the DOT’s other initiatives. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increases the maximum fine for the most serious pipeline safety violations involving deaths, injuries or major environmental harm from $1 million to $2 million. In addition, this law established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines. The law also provides for (i) additional pipeline damage prevention measures; (ii) allowing the Secretary of Transportation to require automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves on new pipelines; (iii) requiring the Secretary of Transportation to evaluate the effectiveness of expanding pipeline integrity management and leak detection requirements; (iv) improving the way the DOT and pipeline operators provide information to the public and emergency responders; and (v) reforming the process by which pipeline operators notify federal, state and local officials of pipeline accidents. On June 22, 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 was enacted, further strengthening PHMSA’s safety authority.
Railcar Regulation
We transport a significant portion of our natural gas liquids, crude oil, ethanol and biodiesel via rail transportation, and we own and lease a fleet of railcars for this purpose. Our railcar operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies.
In May 2015, the DOT finalized new regulations applicable to “high hazard flammable trains.” The final rule created a new North American tank car standard known as the DOT Specification 117, or DOT-117, railcar with thicker steel and redesigned bottom outlet valves, compared to the DOT-111 tank car. In addition, the adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry regarding railcar design or crude oil rail transport activities, or efforts by local communities to restrict or limit rail traffic involving crude oil, could similarly affect our business by increasing compliance costs and decreasing demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows.
Occupational Health Regulations
The workplaces associated with our manufacturing, processing, terminal, storage facilities and distribution facilities are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. We believe we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. Our marine vessel operations are also subject to safety and operational standards established and monitored by the United States Coast Guard. In general, we expect to increase our expenditures relating to compliance with likely higher industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above. However, these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, but we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business.
