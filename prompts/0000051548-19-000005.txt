ITEM 1. BUSINESS
RECENT DEVELOPMENT
On November 9, 2018, NASCAR Holdings, Inc. ("NASCAR Holdings") submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that are not owned by the controlling shareholders of NASCAR Holdings (the “Family Stockholders”), for a purchase price of $42.00 per share, in cash, for each such share of ISC Class A common stock and ISC Class B common stock (the "NASCAR Offer"). 
The NASCAR Offer stated that any transaction would be subject to (i) approval by a special committee ("Special Committee") of our independent directors formed to review the NASCAR Offer and negotiate with NASCAR Holdings in connection therewith; and (ii) a vote in favor of the transaction by a majority of the voting power represented by the shares of the ISC Class A Common Stock and ISC Class B Common Stock held by non-Family Stockholders. 
Our Board of Directors has formed a Special Committee of independent directors to consider the NASCAR Offer. The Board of Directors has selected J. Hyatt Brown, Larry Aiello, Jr., Larree Renda and William Graves, to serve as the Special Committee. Mr. Brown, our lead independent director, chairs the Special Committee. 
The Special Committee has retained Dean Bradley Osborne Partners LLC to act as its financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to act as its legal counsel to assist and advise it in connection with its evaluation of the NASCAR Offer. 
The NASCAR Offer provides that NASCAR Holdings reserves the right to withdraw or modify the NASCAR Offer at any time and no legally binding obligation with respect to any transaction will exist unless and until mutually acceptable definitive documentation is executed and delivered by us and NASCAR Holdings. There can be no assurance that the transaction proposed by NASCAR Holdings or any related transaction will be completed or as to the terms of any such potential transaction, including with respect to pricing or timing.

Our business consists principally of promoting racing events at these major motorsports entertainment facilities, which, in total, currently have approximately 683,000 grandstand seats and 583 suites. We earn revenues and generate substantial cash flows primarily from admissions, television media rights fees, promotion and sponsorship fees, hospitality rentals (including luxury suites, chalets and the hospitality portion of club seating), advertising revenues, royalties from licenses of our trademarks, parking and camping, and track rentals. We own Americrown Service Corporation (“Americrown”), which provides catering, concessions and services at certain of our motorsports entertainment facilities. We own and operate the Motor Racing Network, Inc. ("MRN") radio network, also doing business under the name “MRN Radio”, the nation’s largest independent motorsports radio network in terms of event programming. We have an equity investment in a Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway that has generated substantial equity earnings and cash distributions to us since its opening in fiscal year 2012. We have developed a retail, dining and entertainment destination, ONE DAYTONA, across from Daytona International Speedway, which is creating synergy with the Speedway, enhancing customer and partner experiences, monetizing real estate on International Speedway Blvd. and leveraging our real estate on a year-round basis.
At the beginning of fiscal 2019, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series became the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series. Throughout this document, the naming convention for this series is consistent with the current branding.
INCORPORATION
We were incorporated in 1953 under the laws of the State of Florida under the name “Bill France Racing, Inc.” and changed our name to “Daytona International Speedway Corporation” in 1957. With the groundbreaking for Talladega Superspeedway in 1968, we changed our name to “International Speedway Corporation.” Our principal executive offices are located at One Daytona Boulevard, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114, and our telephone number is (386) 254-2700. We maintain a website at http://www.internationalspeedwaycorporation.com/. The information on our website is not part of this report.
OPERATIONS
The general nature of our business is a motorsports themed amusement enterprise, furnishing amusement to the public in the form of motorsports themed entertainment. Our motorsports themed event operations consist principally of racing events at our major motorsports entertainment facilities, which include providing catering and food and beverage concessions at our motorsports entertainment facilities that host NASCAR Cup Series events, except for catering and food and beverage concessions at Chicagoland, ISM Raceway, and Route 66, where Levy Premium Foodservice ("Levy”) provides food and beverage catering and/or concessions. Our other operations include MRN; our 50.0 percent equity investment in the joint venture Kansas Entertainment, LLC ("Kansas Entertainment"), which operates the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway; and certain other activities including retail, dining and entertainment operations at ONE DAYTONA. We derived approximately 88.9 percent of our 2018 revenues from NASCAR-sanctioned racing events at our wholly owned motorsports entertainment facilities. In addition to events sanctioned by NASCAR, in fiscal 2018, we promoted other stock car, sports car, open wheel, motorcycle and go-kart racing events.
Food, Beverage and Merchandise Operations
We conduct, either through operations of the particular facility or through our wholly owned subsidiary, Americrown, food and beverage concession operations and catering services, both in suites and chalets, for customers at each of our motorsports entertainment facilities with the exception of food and beverage concessions and catering services at Chicagoland, ISM Raceway, and Route 66, where Levy provides food and beverage catering and/or concessions. As of January 2019, the Company is in negotiations with MainGate Inc. ("MainGate") for MainGate to have exclusive retail merchandise rights for our track trademarks and certain other ISC owned intellectual property at all ISC tracks. This service was previously provided by Fanatics Retail Group Concessions, Inc. ("Fanatics") since January 2015. In January 2019, we acquired the assets, including trademarks and certain other intellectual property, for Racing Electronics. Racing Electronics provides rental and sale of communication and technology equipment at motorsports events, including NASCAR, ARCA, IndyCar, NHRA, World Racing Group and United States Auto Club ("USAC").
Motor Racing Network, Inc.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, MRN, also does business under the name “MRN Radio”. While not a radio station, MRN creates motorsports-related programming content carried on radio stations around the country as well as on a national satellite radio service, Sirius XMRadio. MRN produces and syndicates to radio stations live coverage of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series races and certain other races conducted at our motorsports entertainment facilities, as well as some races conducted at motorsports entertainment facilities we do not own. Sirius XM Radio also compensates

MRN for the contemporaneous re-airing of race broadcasts and certain other production services. MRN produces and provides unique content to its website, http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/, and derives revenue from the sale of advertising on such website. Each motorsports entertainment facility has the ability to separately contract for the rights to radio broadcasts of NASCAR and certain other events held at its location. In addition, MRN provides production services for the trackside large screen video display units ("ISM Vision") at NASCAR Cup Series event weekends that take place at our motorsports facilities, as well as at Dover International Speedway and Pocono Raceway. MRN also produces and syndicates daily and weekly NASCAR racing-themed programs. MRN derives revenue from the sale of national advertising contained in its syndicated programming, the sale of advertising and audio and video production services for ISM Vision, as well as from rights fees paid by radio stations that broadcast the programming. 
ONE DAYTONA
We have developed a retail, dining and entertainment destination, ONE DAYTONA, across from Daytona International Speedway, which is creating synergy with the Speedway, enhancing customer and partner experiences, monetizing real estate on International Speedway Blvd. and leveraging our real estate on a year-round basis (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - ONE DAYTONA").
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway
We have a 50/50 partnership with Penn Hollywood Kansas Inc. (“Penn”), a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates a Hollywood-themed and branded destination entertainment facility, overlooking turn two at Kansas. Penn is the managing member of Kansas Entertainment and is responsible for the operation of the casino (see "Equity and Other Investments"). 
Fairfield Inn Hotel at ONE DAYTONA
We have a 33.25 percent equity interest in Daytona Hotel Two, LLC ("Fairfield"), a partnership with Daytona Hospitality Group II, LLC ("DHGII"), a subsidiary of Prime-Shaner Groups, to construct and operate a Fairfield Inn hotel. DHGII is the managing member of the Fairfield and is responsible for the development and operations of the hotel (see "Equity and Other Investments").
The Autograph Hotel at ONE DAYTONA
We have a 34.0 percent equity interest in Daytona Hotel One, LLC ("Autograph") a partnership with Daytona Hospitality Group, LLC ("DHG"), a subsidiary of Prime-Shaner Groups, to construct and operate an Autograph hotel. DHG is the managing member of the Autograph and is responsible for the development and operations of the hotel (see "Equity and Other Investments").
Residential Project at ONE DAYTONA
Daytona Apartment Holdings, LLC, a joint venture of Daytona Residential Group, LLC, a subsidiary of Prime-Shaner Groups, and Daytona Beach Property Holdings Retail, LLC, was formed to own, construct and operate the residential component of ONE DAYTONA. The joint venture is structured similarly to the Fairfield and the ONE DAYTONA joint ventures, where our share of equity will be limited to our non-cash land contribution and we will share in the profits from the joint venture proportionately to our equity ownership. As of November 30, 2018, no contributions have been made towards the residential component of ONE DAYTONA (see "Equity and Other Investments").

Other Activities
From time to time, we use our motorsports entertainment facilities for testing for teams, driving schools, riding experiences, car shows, auto fairs, concerts, music festivals and settings for television commercials, print advertisements and motion pictures, which may be promoted by us or a third party. 
Competition
We are among the largest owners of major motorsports themed entertainment facilities based on revenues, number of facilities owned and/or operated, number of motorsports themed events promoted and market capitalization. Racing events compete with other professional sports such as football, basketball, hockey and baseball, as well as other recreational events and activities. Our events also compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies such as NASCAR, the American Sportbike Racing Association — Championship Cup Series, USAC, Sports Car Club of America (“SCCA”), IMSA, IndyCar Series, ARCA and others, many of which are often held on the same dates at separate motorsports entertainment facilities. We believe that the type and caliber of promoted racing events, facility location, sight lines, pricing, variety of motorsports themed amusement options and level of customer conveniences and amenities are the principal factors that distinguish competing motorsports entertainment facilities.
Employees
As of November 30, 2018, we had over 850 full-time employees. We also engage a significant number of temporary personnel to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events, some of whom are volunteers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
