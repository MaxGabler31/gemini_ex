Item 1. Description of Business
GENERAL
 
Fellazo Corp. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 28, 2014.
 
During the year ending August 31, 2018 the Company had commenced its transformation process into an IT based company specialized in Mobile Application Developments with worldwide clientele and a portfolio investment company in primary industries such as healthcare, energy, development and capital market.
 
Our office is located at 8th Floor, Wisma Huazong, Lot 15285, 0.7km Lebuhraya Sungei Besi, 43300 Seri Kembangan, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.
 
As at August 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of $540,135 and has not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating cost for the foreseeable future. These factors, among others, may raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
In 2019, the Company is planning to commence it operations with heavy emphasis into healthcare - primarily bird-nest based health supplement and bird-nest related health produces which include manufacturing and retail (retail chain and online). With our expertise in online applications platform, we would be developing an online network platform to market and sell our produces and also a system to source and purchase raw materials we required.
 
Prime market for our produces at this stage would be East and South East Asia with focus into China’s upcoming consumer market.
 
We will also be sourcing funds from potential investors to finance purchases of raw materials needed to support our operations and surplus for potential buyers.
 
We believe this is significant growth potential to the Company which would generate more than sufficient revenue and liquidity to sustain the Company for the next twelve months and a significant future growth.
