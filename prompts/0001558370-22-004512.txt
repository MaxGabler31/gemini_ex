ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
​
Unless the context otherwise requires, “G-III,” “us,” “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 is referred to as “fiscal 2022.”
​
G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974.
​
Overview
​
We design, source and market an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. G-III has a substantial portfolio of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. We are not only licensees, but also brand owners, and we distribute our products through multiple channels.
​
Our own proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel. We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Levi’s, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Vince Camuto and Dockers. Through our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We also source and sell products to major retailers under their private retail labels.
​
Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy’s, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Saks Fifth Avenue division, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington. We also sell our products using digital channels through retail partners such as macys.com, nordstrom.com and dillards.com, each of which has a substantial online business. In addition, we sell to leading online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made a minority investment in an e-commerce retailer.
​
We also distribute apparel and other products directly to consumers through our own DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris retail stores, as well as through our digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel businesses. In fiscal 2021, we restructured our retail operations and completed the closing of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and Calvin Klein Performance stores. This restructuring enabled us to reduce our losses in our retail operations segment and re-position our retail operations with a goal of becoming a profitable contributor to our business.
​
We operate in fashion markets that are intensely competitive. Our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes, across multiple market segments, distribution channels and geographic areas is critical to our success. Although our portfolio of brands is aimed at diversifying our risks in this regard, misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on our business. Our success in the future will depend on our ability to design products that are accepted in the marketplace, source the manufacture of our products on a competitive basis, and continue to diversify our product portfolio and the markets we serve.
​
Segments
​
We report based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations.
​
Our wholesale operations segment includes sales of products to retailers under owned, licensed and private label brands, as well as sales related to the Vilebrequin business. Wholesale revenues also include royalty revenues from license agreements related to our owned trademarks including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass and Andrew Marc. 
​

Bass, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather.

Recent Developments
​
Impact of COVID-19
​
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected businesses around the world since the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Federal, state and local governments in the United States and around the world, as well as private entities, mandated various restrictions, including closing of retail stores and restaurants, travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories, and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant disruption of the financial and retail markets, including a disruption in consumer demand for apparel and accessories.
​
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. During fiscal 2022, consumer demand for apparel and accessories, as well as other consumer discretionary spending, increased as compared to fiscal 2021. While businesses reopened as stay at home orders were lifted and various restrictions on the operation of retail businesses were loosened, the continued economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. The spread of additional variants could result in the reimposition of restrictions on commercial and social activities that would adversely impact our business. We have experienced significant improvements in our results of operations for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our business operations and results of operations.
​
The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations remains uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on continued developments in the public and private responses to the pandemic and the success and efficacy of efforts in the United States and around the world to vaccinate people against COVID-19. New information may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus in locations that are important to our business. Actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact may change or become more restrictive if additional waves of infections occur.
​
Inter Parfums
​
In September 2021, we entered into a long-term global licensing agreement with Inter Parfums, Inc. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance-related products under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. Inter Parfums, Inc. will become the exclusive licensee for these products effective July 1, 2022 with the initial term of the license extending through December 31, 2032. We believe the fragrance category enables our brands to connect more broadly with global consumers.
​
Sonia Rykiel
​
In October 2021, we purchased European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. Sonia Rykiel, who created this iconic brand, was one of the leading figures of Parisian fashion. We plan to accelerate the relaunch of the brand in France in the fall of 2022, and then expand into Europe and other areas. We believe this purchase further enables us to expand into the luxury space and that there is untapped potential for this brand.
​
Sonia Rykiel is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary that reports results on a calendar year basis rather than the January 31 fiscal year basis used by the Company. Accordingly, the results of Sonia Rykiel are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

Strategic Initiatives
​
We are focused on the following strategic initiatives, which we believe are critical to our long-term success: 
​

● | Owning brands: We own a portfolio of proprietary brands including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Sonia Rykiel. Owning our own brands is advantageous to us for several reasons:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | We can realize significantly higher operating margins because we are not required to pay licensing fees on sales by us of our proprietary products and can also generate licensing revenues (which have no related cost of goods sold) for classes of products not manufactured by us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | There are no channel restrictions, permitting us to market our products internationally, and to utilize a variety of different distribution channels, including online and off-price channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to license our proprietary brands in new categories and geographies to carefully selected licensees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We are able to build equity in these brands to benefit the long-term interests of our stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Develop and expand our DKNY and Donna Karan businesses: We believe that DKNY and Donna Karan are two of the most iconic and recognizable power brands and that we are well positioned to unlock their potential and expand the reach of these brands. We are leveraging our demonstrated ability to drive organic growth and develop talent within our Company to maximize the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. Our strategy is for DKNY and Donna Karan to be more accessible brands, both designed and priced to reach a wider range of customers. We have positioned Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores globally. We launched our DKNY Jeans denim collection during fiscal 2021. We believe there is untapped global licensing and distribution potential for these brands and aim to grow royalty streams in the DKNY and Donna Karan businesses through expansion of additional categories with existing licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. We are committed to making DKNY a fashion and lifestyle brand of choice.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Focusing on our five global power brands: While we sell products under more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands, five global power brands anchor our business: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. Each of these brands has substantial name recognition and is well-known in the marketplace. We believe each brand also provides us with significant growth opportunities. We have leveraged the strength of our power brands to become a supplier of choice in a diversified range of product categories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Expanding our international business: We continue to expand our international business and enter into new markets worldwide. We believe that the international sales and profit opportunity is quite significant for our DKNY and Donna Karan businesses. We are expanding our DKNY business globally. The key markets in which our DKNY merchandise is currently distributed include Europe, China, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Korea. Continued growth, brand development and marketing in these key markets is critical to driving global brand recognition. In addition, during fiscal 2022, we purchased European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. Sonia Rykiel, who created this iconic brand, was one of the leading figures of Parisian fashion. We believe this purchase further enables us to expand into the international luxury space and that there is untapped potential for this brand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Increasing digital channel business opportunities: We are continuing to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the digital marketplace in the retail sector and expect to increase the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning, distribution and other strategic opportunities to expand our digital footprint. Consumers are increasingly engaging with brands through digital channels, and we believe that this trend will continue to grow in the coming years. The five global power brands that serve as the anchor of our business position us to be the direct beneficiaries of this trend, whether by continuing to leverage our partnerships with the digital channel businesses operated by our licensors and major retailers to facilitate customer engagement or by building out our own digital capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Opportunity for long-term profitability in our retail operations: Our retail operations segment consists of our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores, as well as the digital channels for DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather. We continue to make changes to our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld retail operations which has enabled us to greatly reduce our losses in our retail operations segment and is expected to ultimately position this segment to become profitable.

​
Our Strengths
​
Broad portfolio of globally recognized brands.  In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of more than 30 licensed and proprietary brands anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris, which have strong brand equity and long-standing consumer appeal. We believe that these five globally recognized power brands have potential for future growth. Our overall brand portfolio includes other complementary brands that are diversified across product categories, price points, demographics, occasions, fits and sizes, and styles and genres. Our proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel. We believe we are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, consisting of fashion brands including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Levi’s, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Vince Camuto, and Dockers and team sports oriented brands, including the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We believe that our well-diversified brand portfolio with power brands and complementary brands is well positioned to satisfy ongoing consumer needs and preferences. Additionally, our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major customers to select us as a partner of choice for their own private label programs.
​
We currently market apparel and other products under, among others, the following licensed and proprietary brand names:

Long-standing relationships forged with retailers and license partners through emphasis on design, sourcing and quality control. We believe our core strengths provide a foundation that drives our partnerships with retailers and licensors. Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products, and our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they seek to project. We believe that we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control. Our service, brand stewardship and industry expertise have allowed us to continue to deliver as a go-to preferred partner for many of our customers.
​
Well-developed supply chain infrastructure is a key core competency that leverages strong vendor relationships developed over the past 40 years. We have long-standing, trust-based relationships with our vendors that form the foundation of our global supply chain that has been built upon over the last 40 years. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to access the highest quality products, negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor, access new technology and design insights, and enhance our market intelligence. We support and cultivate these relationships by continuously investing management time while also maintaining a physical presence in key jurisdictions. We employ a quality control team and a sourcing group to ensure the quality of our products, as well as local teams that operate on the ground with a hands-on approach and a deep-rooted knowledge base with respect to our manufacturers. By working closely with our global partners on all aspects of the supply chain, we aim to safeguard against potential disruptions. We believe that we have a long-standing competitive advantage with our current supply chain partners and we continue to focus on broadening the breadth and depth of our inventory sourcing capabilities. We continue to diversify our product portfolio and mix and we have proactively reduced the percentage of our inventory that is sourced from China. Inventory sourced by us from China represented 34.2% of inventory purchased in fiscal 2022 compared to 32.8% in fiscal 2021 and 49.5% in fiscal 2020. We continue to focus on methods aimed at bolstering production and devising and implementing strategies to further diversify our production base and expand sourcing capabilities across the globe while leveraging best practices and strong vendor relationships.
​
Diversified business mix across customers, price points, products, and distribution channels.  We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are sold to approximately 1,200 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy’s, Dillard’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Saks Fifth Avenue division, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam’s Club. We also sell to leading online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made a minority investment in an e-commerce retailer. Our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and our objective of meeting or exceeding retailer expectations. In addition, we continue to make changes to our business to address the additional challenges and opportunities created by the evolving role of the online marketplace in the retail sector and expect to expand the sale of our products in an omni-channel environment. As economic conditions waver and consumer trends change, we believe that our deep-rooted relationships across the retail landscape, diversified brands serving all types of consumers and our product portfolio mix that covers all price points allow us to operate on a flexible and advantageous basis.
​
Experienced management team.  Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry. Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been with us for over 45 years. Sammy Aaron, our Vice Chairman and President, joined us in 2005 when we acquired Marvin Richards, Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for over 15 years and Jeffrey Goldfarb, our Executive Vice President, has been with us for almost 20 years. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed nine acquisitions and several joint ventures over the last 15 years, while also adding numerous new licenses and licensed products to our portfolio.

Wholesale Operations
​
Licensed Products
​
The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for the past 25 years. Sales of licensed products accounted for 67.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 68.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 65.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2020.
​
Our most significant licensor is Calvin Klein with whom we have license agreements for wholesale sales in the United States and Canada. We have also entered into distribution agreements with respect to Calvin Klein luggage in a number of foreign countries. In June 2019, we expanded our relationship with Calvin Klein by entering into a license agreement with an initial term of five years for the design, production and wholesale distribution of Calvin Klein Jeans women’s jeanswear in the United States and Canada. 
​
We also have a significant relationship with Tommy Hilfiger, with whom we have a multi-category womenswear license in the United States and Canada. This license for women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, performance and denim is in addition to our Tommy Hilfiger men’s and women’s outerwear license and Tommy Hilfiger luggage license, both also in the United States and Canada. We recently extended the license agreement with Tommy Hilfiger for apparel, outerwear and luggage through 2025.
​
We own a 49% interest in a joint venture that owns the trademarks for the Karl Lagerfeld brand in North America. As part of that relationship, we have a license agreement with the joint venture for the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand in North America, pursuant to which we produce and distribute women’s apparel, women’s footwear, women’s handbags, men’s apparel, men’s footwear, cold weather accessories and luggage under the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand. In fiscal 2022, we renewed our license agreement with the joint venture for Karl Lagerfeld Paris until 2026.

We have continually sought to increase our portfolio of name brands, product offerings and tiers of distribution because we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know and brand owners prefer to engage licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands.
​
Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements may also restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our material obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. Our ability to renew a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement.
​
Proprietary Brands
​
Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under its own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. We also acquired Andrew Marc, an aspirational luxury outerwear brand, G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, a premier swimwear and resort wear brand. In our most significant acquisition, we acquired Donna Karan International, which owns DKNY and Donna Karan, two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. In October 2021, we acquired European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. We currently design, manufacture, distribute and sell products under our own proprietary brands, as well as license our proprietary brands in a variety of categories. We continue to seek new licensing opportunities to broaden the reach of these brands.
​
DKNY and Donna Karan
​
We own two of the world’s most iconic fashion brands: DKNY and Donna Karan. First launched in 1984, DKNY and Donna Karan design, source, market, retail and distribute collections of women’s and men’s clothing, sportswear, handbags, accessories and shoes under the DKNY and Donna Karan brand names.
​
Based on DKNY’s and Donna Karan’s significant brand equity, we believe there are opportunities to expand existing categories, launch new initiatives and develop an even stronger licensing and distribution base. We believe that both the DKNY and Donna Karan brands have the potential for significant growth. In addition, we expect increased revenues from licensing and from sales growth across many categories of the business.
​
Our DKNY products are designed to provide a total wardrobe for a woman’s active, modern lifestyle. Products developed reflect the DNA of the DKNY brand and emphasize a strong price-value relationship. We believe that DKNY is a premier fashion and lifestyle brand. DKNY products produced by us or by our various licensees are sold through department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers worldwide, as well as through company-operated retail stores, digital sites and international brand partners and distributors. We launched our first DKNY Jeans collection in fiscal 2021 and our DKNY swimwear collection in fiscal 2022.
​
We believe that the Donna Karan brand also offers significant growth potential. We re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores located in the United States, such as Dillard’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Bloomingdales, as well as fine department stores internationally.
​
We believe there are significant opportunities to enhance the digital business of DKNY and Donna Karan, prudently expand the retail store base for DKNY over the long term and capitalize on our industry relationships to ensure premium placement for DKNY and Donna Karan product categories in department and other retail stores nationwide. 
​

Vilebrequin
​
Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin products are sold in over 100 countries around the world. We believe that Vilebrequin has the potential to significantly develop its distribution network worldwide and expand its product offerings. A majority of Vilebrequin’s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2022, Vilebrequin products were distributed through select wholesale distribution, 96 company-operated stores and 79 licensed stores, located internationally and in the United States, as well as digitally on our websites.
​
Vilebrequin’s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin’s men’s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cuts. In addition to men’s swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a collection of women’s swimwear, children’s swimwear, men’s resort wear, women’s resort wear, children’s resort wear and related accessories including hats, beach bags, beach towels, shoes, sunglasses, watches and pool floats. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company operated and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin products throughout the world.
​
Sonia Rykiel
​
In October 2021, we purchased European luxury fashion brand Sonia Rykiel. Sonia Rykiel, who created this iconic brand, was one of the leading figures of Parisian fashion. We plan to accelerate the relaunch of the brand in France in the fall of 2022, and then expand into Europe and other areas. We believe this purchase further enables us to expand into the luxury space and that there is untapped potential for this brand.
​
Licensing of Proprietary Brands
As our portfolio of propriety brands has grown, we have licensed these brands in new categories. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands. Our licensing program has significantly increased as a result of owning the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. We currently license our proprietary brands in a variety of categories and continue to seek new licensing opportunities to broaden the reach of these brands.
​
We have strong relationships with category leading license partners, including, but not limited to, Fossil, Marchon, Komar and Inter Parfums. The DKNY and Donna Karan brands have worldwide license agreements for a broad array of products including fragrance, intimates, eyewear, bedding and bath products and women’s sleepwear and loungewear. Additionally, we license the DKNY brand in the United States and internationally for children’s clothing, children’s footwear, men’s and women’s watches, jewelry, men’s tailored clothing, men’s sportswear, men’s dress shirts, men’s underwear, men’s loungewear, men’s swimwear, men’s and women’s golfwear, men’s and women’s socks, furniture and digital clothing (skins).
​
In September 2021, we entered into a long-term global licensing agreement with Inter Parfums, Inc. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance-related products under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. Inter Parfums, Inc. will become the exclusive licensee for these products effective July 1, 2022 with the initial term of the license extending through December 31, 2032. We believe the fragrance category enables our brands to connect more broadly with global consumers.
​
We intend to continue to focus on expanding licensing opportunities for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential for these brands in a number of categories and we intend to grow royalty streams by expanding existing licenses, as well as through new categories with new licensees.
​
We license the G.H. Bass brand in the United States and internationally for men’s, women’s and children’s footwear, children’s clothing, men’s and women’s graphic t-shirts, men’s denim, men’s underwear and loungewear, and bedding and bath products.
​
We license the Vilebrequin brand internationally for a denim line and the Andrew Marc brand in North America for men’s and boy’s tailored clothing and men’s and women’s denim.

Retail Operations
​
As of January 31, 2022, our retail operations segment consisted of 60 stores operated under our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris brands, as well as digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather businesses.
​
In June 2020, we commenced a restructuring of our retail operations segment, including the closing of the Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and Calvin Klein Performance stores. The closure of these stores was completed during fiscal 2021.
​
Part of our restructuring plan includes making significant changes to our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld retail operations. Our ongoing plan focuses on the operations and growth of our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores, as well as operating our digital business. Our plan is based on the continued strength of the DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld brands, changes in planning and allocation and improvements in gross margin. We expect to reduce administrative costs, while expanding our store base. We need to successfully implement this strategy in order to continue to reduce the losses in our retail operations segment with the goal of ultimately attaining profitability in this segment.
​
Our DKNY stores offer a large range of products including sportswear, dresses, suit separates, outerwear, handbags, footwear, intimates, sleepwear, hosiery, watches and eyewear. Our Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores offer a range of products including sportswear, dresses, suit separates, outerwear, handbags and footwear. 
​
As digital sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing additional digital marketing initiatives on our websites and through social media. We are investing in digital personnel, marketing, logistics, planning, distribution and other strategic opportunities to expand our digital footprint. Our digital business consists of our own web platforms at www.dkny.com, www.donnakaran.com, www.ghbass.com, www.vilebrequin.com, www.andrewmarc.com, www.wilsonsleather.com and www.soniarykiel.com. We also sell our Karl Lagerfeld Paris products on our website, www.karllagerfeldparis.com. We sell our products over the web through retail partners such as macys.com, nordstrom.com and dillards.com, each of which has a substantial online business. In addition, we sell to leading online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos and have made a minority investment in an e-commerce retailer.
​
Products — Development and Design 
​
G-III designs, sources and markets women’s and men’s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories, and luggage.
​
G-III’s licensed apparel consists of both women’s and men’s products in a broad range of categories. See “Wholesale Operations — Licensed Products” above. Our strategy is to seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands.
​
We work with a diversified group of retail chains, such as Costco, Kohl’s, Ross Stores and Nordstrom in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom-made products for department and specialty chain stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis.
​
Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles.
​

11



Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. In addition, our representatives regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the United States, Europe and the Far East for inspiration. Our designers present their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion.
​
Manufacturing and Sourcing
​
G-III’s wholesale operations and retail operations segments arrange for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in Vietnam, China, Indonesia and, to a lesser extent, Jordan, India, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and Central and South America. Vilebrequin’s products are manufactured primarily in Bulgaria, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Italy and China. A small portion of our garments are manufactured in the United States.
​
We continue to diversify production and implement strategies to further diversify our production base. Inventory sourced by us from Vietnam represented 32.2% of inventory purchased in fiscal 2022 compared to 36.2% in fiscal 2021 and 24.6% in fiscal 2020. Inventory sourced by us from China represented 34.2% of inventory purchased in fiscal 2022 compared to 32.8% in fiscal 2021 and 49.5% in fiscal 2020. Our experienced production teams in Vietnam, China and the Middle East support our efforts to further develop quality production partners in South East Asia and Africa.
​
We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing and Dongguan, China, as well as in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Jordan. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. G-III’s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, compliance, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements.
​
To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Our Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis and acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. 
​
In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site.
​
We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping.
​
As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available.
​
A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer’s needs, cost and timing considerations.

Vendor Code of Conduct
​
We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Vendor Code of Conduct. Our Vendor Code of Conduct specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training and guidance to the factories our contractors use related to our Vendor Code of Conduct and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Vendor Code of Conduct. In addition to the contractual obligation, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Vendor Code of Conduct through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms.
​
Human Capital 
​
Our People
​
Our success in fiscal 2021 is due to the strong work ethic, flexibility and agility demonstrated by our high performing team in spite of the many challenges we faced. The pandemic forced us to rethink the way we work with one another, and our team adapted to the new work environment. We continue to support them in achieving their professional goals. 
​
As of January 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,900 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 700 on a part-time basis. Our need for seasonal associates was significantly reduced with the completion of the restructuring of our retail segment during the prior fiscal year. We employ both union and non-union personnel and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees.
​
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer with policies, procedures and practices that recognize the value and worth of each individual, covering matters such as safety, training, advancement, discrimination, harassment and retaliation. We provide training on important issues to our personnel. G-III ensures compliance with labor and employment law issues through a variety of processes and procedures, using both internal and external expertise and resources. We continue to work towards achieving a stronger, more engaging workplace and building a foundation for enhancing the employee experience by beginning to redefine our corporate branding to promote our passion for our product, pride in our partnerships, our accountability and our entrepreneurial spirit, which we began to roll out in fiscal 2022. As part of our corporate branding efforts, we launched an enhanced corporate website in March 2022.
​
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and customers and have taken extra care to protect them throughout the pandemic with continued workplace policies and procedures. As our team re-entered the office, we were thoughtful, yet flexible, in our approach, adjusting days in the office based on the fluctuating levels of COVID-19 cases and the needs of our employees.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
We are a diverse workplace and know that, to succeed, we must become an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. Currently, over 50% of our leadership team and 70% of our overall workforce self-identify as women, and 47% of our overall workforce identify as Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”). Of our twelve Board members, there are three women and two persons of diverse backgrounds, exceeding NASDAQ requirements for board diversity. We recognize that insights and ideas from a diverse range of backgrounds will better position us for the future and continue to work towards increasing Board diversity.
​
Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion also extends outside of our business. We are a founding member of the groundbreaking Social Justice Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a premier fashion university, whose 

13



purpose is to help establish a program that is intended to increase opportunities and accelerate social equity for BIPOC persons entering our industry for years to come. Additionally, we continued our partnership with UNCF (“United Negro College Fund”) by fully funding ten scholarships worth $10,000 each. In fiscal 2023, we will begin our second year of funding this scholarship program. Both initiatives include opportunities for students to gain firsthand experience working at G-III. 
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are at the heart of G-III’s values. We strive to create a workplace with opportunities for all. We have made progress and intend to continue to do so in the coming years.
​
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
​
Having the right talent in the organization is one of the most critical aspects of our business. This year we grew our HR team to enhance opportunities focused on hiring, developing and retaining talent. We invested in new HR systems that have laid the foundation for a newly created talent development program and framework for compensation. 
​
Through our aggressive recruiting, we have been able to bring in best-in-class talent. We had several key hires at the company, including a new head of digital, who is building a new team to accelerate the development of our digital function. Further, we hired a new HR executive who will be working on new employee engagement initiatives in the coming year and will focus on enacting our development programs.
​
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness
​
We expanded our comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees this year, most notably, the inclusion of In Vitro Fertility medical treatment, which has already enriched the lives of some of our employees. 
​
Corporate Social Responsibility 
​
We spent significant time implementing our key initiatives, developing programs and furthering our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) agenda.
​

● | Engage Our People – Our teams are continuing to build upon the successes of last year as we ensured that business was conducted despite the impact of the pandemic. As our teams re-entered the office, we were thoughtful, yet flexible, in our approach, adjusting days in the office based on the fluctuating levels of COVID-19 cases and the needs of our personnel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In our supply chain, we made progress on our social compliance programs, as we furthered our auditing of factories producing product for us throughout our global supply chain and rolled out the Social Labor Convergence Program (“SLCP”), after becoming members last year. This program allows companies to share verified audits across the industry, enabling factories to reduce redundancies and focus on making standardized improvements. This program enables G-III to better assist factories in dealing with their most pressing issues, while adding more protections and beneficial programs for workers. In working with our vendors, we tracked a 20% adoption rate which we intend to continue to grow.
​
We have continued to focus on the forced labor issues facing our industry and have reviewed our relationships in an attempt to protect against the use of forced labor in our supply chain. We formalized an internal cotton traceability program to further mitigate the risk of forced labor being used to produce product for us. This program includes enhancements to management systems, training, and tracking tools across our supply chain. To further bolster our programs against this risk, we engaged ORITAINTM, a third-party that uses forensic technology to trace materials back to their fiber origins. We routinely engage with counsel and industry organizations with respect to regulatory developments to ensure our practices and procedures are aligning with the continually developing regulatory landscape. Combined with ORITAINTM’s technology and our internal management systems, we are working to mitigate these global supply chain risks. Taken together, we believe we have developed a strong approach and intend to continue to refine our oversight of our supply chain.

● | Protect Our Environment - We continue to work towards reducing our environmental impact by enacting sustainable fashion practices. As we work to understand and establish baseline metrics to measure our progress, we are also setting long-term goals. One of our first goals is to adopt the use of 100% recycled materials for all synthetic fibers by 2030. Additionally, we are increasing utilization of sustainable fabrics, which include recycled and organic fibers that are manufactured with less water, chemicals and energy, thus reducing their environmental impact. We began internal training on sourcing to increase use of these more sustainable materials to meet these goals. Additionally, our supply chain expertise is expected to enable us to reach these milestones while minimizing the impact to our bottom line. Our increased engagement with industry groups and the necessary tools we are providing for our teams will assist us in continuing to adapt to help make a better change in the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Invest in Our Communities – For years, G-III has been committed to global corporate citizenship by giving back where we live and serve. Throughout the pandemic, our support has not waivered, and we continue to maximize opportunities to give to and engage with our partners. We are involved with various charitable organizations including Ronald McDonald House, Women In Need (“WIN”), UNCF, Delivering Good, Hetrick Martin Institute and City Harvest. Additionally, G-III gave one of the founding gifts for the new Social Justice Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Further, support for our charitable partners included much-needed funds and in-kind products. G-III is committed to continuing its mission to help others in the community through corporate and employee donations and volunteerism.
​
As we emerge from the global pandemic, our teams are returning to the office and reestablishing the cohesion of a shared workspace and our commitment to our core CSR principles: Engage Our People, Protect Our Environment and Invest in Our Community. They represent a commitment to the greater good and our role in the global community.
​
Customs and Trade Issues
​
Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for products and the imposition of export duties. Customs duties on our products presently range from duty free to 37.5%, depending upon the product, composition, construction, country of origin and country of import. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels. Any action by the executive branch of the United States government to increase tariffs on imported goods, such as the imposition of tariffs on goods manufactured in China, could adversely affect our business. 
​
Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. 
​
Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.
​
Marketing and Distribution
​
G-III’s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 1,200 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and through digital channels for the DKNY, Donna Karan, G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel businesses, as well as the digital channels of our retail partners such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Amazon, Fanatics, Zalando and Zappos.
​
Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 78.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 73.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 72.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. Sales to Macy’s, which includes sales to its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s store chains, as well as through macys.com, accounted for an aggregate of 23.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 20.9% of our 

15



net sales in fiscal 2021 and 26.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. Sales to TJX Companies accounted for an aggregate of 14.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 12.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 13.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. In addition, sales to Ross Stores accounted for an aggregate of 12.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 9.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 7.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. The loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
​
A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also sell our products to customers in Canada, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 14.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 14.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 12.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. 
​
Our products are sold primarily through our direct sales force along with our principal executives who are also actively involved in the sale of our products. Some of our products are also sold by independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. Vilebrequin products are sold through a direct sales force primarily located across Europe. Sales outside of the United States and Canada may be managed by our salespeople located in our sales offices in Europe or Asia depending on the customer.
​
Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us.
​
Our marketing and press efforts on behalf of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands are highly focused around communicating brand DNA and visual identity for the new evolution of DKNY and Donna Karan. We are re-building the brand image through high impact ad campaigns that feature socially relevant talent. We are striving to create noteworthy marketing initiatives, collaborations and image programs to build brand awareness and bring in a new young customer. Donna Karan and DKNY will continue to support global licensees with brand campaigns and product images to tell the brand story. We expect to invest in digital media and storytelling for brand amplification and to establish comprehensive commercial marketing tools that will support our global wholesale and retail channels.
​
Vilebrequin’s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women’s swimwear, ready-to-wear and accessories. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and to develop new markets in Asia.
​
We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products.
​
As digital sales of apparel continue to increase, we are developing initiatives to increase our digital presence through our own websites and through the websites of our retail partners. We are working closely with our retail partners to provide consumers with a high quality viewing experience for our products. We are also working to increase our digital sales through marketing, social influencers and other online drivers of sales.
​
Seasonality
​
Retail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Net sales during the third and fourth quarters accounted for approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 66% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 

16



2020. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a larger amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future.
​
Trademarks
​
We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our business. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading “Wholesale Operations – Licensed Products” above. We also use the licensed Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand in our retail operations segment. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Wilsons Leather, Sonia Rykiel and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products.
​
In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets.
​
We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
