Item 1. Business
 
PEN develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products enabled by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of products enabled by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, CLARITY DEFOGIT brand defogging products and CLARITY ULTRASEAL nanocoating products for glass and ceramics. We also sell an environmentally friendly surface protector, fortifier, and cleaner. Our design center conducts product development services for us and for government and private customers and develops and sells printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows.
 
PEN was formed in 2014, and it is the successor to Applied Nanotech Holdings Inc. that had been formed in 1989. In the combination that created PEN, Nanofilm, Ltd. acquired Applied Nanotech Holdings, Inc. Our principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities and types of products sold. This is consistent with our internal reporting structure. Our two reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment (which we formerly called the Research and development segment).
 
Product Segment
 
Revenue is based on the retail and institutional sale of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. Our consumer products are sold as liquids, gels, foam and as wet and dry towelettes. Institutional products are sold in liquid form enabling application by a variety of common commercial techniques We rely on intellectual property including trade secret formulations to protect our proprietary technology.
 
We have three broad product technology platforms that offer solutions to some common problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging, preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear. All our products have some “nano” characteristic about them – whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness.
 
One line of consumer products center on our customized optical cleaning and de-fogging treatments. Another line of consumer products focuses on creating hygienic surfaces unfriendly to germs. In our consumer products, we strive to create segment leading brands that are sustainable, of high quality, and that are both easy and safe to apply. Institutional products include a family of coating liquids that create very thin, strongly-bound, clear coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surface and a series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron size particles to improve abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace.
 
Our products encompass:
 

● | Liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for eyeglass and sunglass lens cleaning and protection. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Liquid formulation packaged for retail and institutional sale for cleaning and creating hygienic surfaces unfriendly to germs. 
● | Anti-fogging liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including face shields, and sporting goggles. 
● | Anti-fogging towelettes for sale to the military for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and other applications such as head’s up displays, 
● | Mar resistant and stain resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as restaurants, cruise ships, casinos. 
● | Clear protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include automotive and hand-held devices. 
● | Protective and water repelling coatings on interior glass and ceramic surfaces to make it easy to clean and prevent scale and grime encrustation. 
● | Coatings for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses.

We also believe that products enabled by nanotechnology can tackle and solve big, global problems in selected growing markets. We have three primary areas of new product focus:
 

1. | Health: Treating or printing of surfaces at the nano-scale to promote health, fight the spread of disease, and assist in the arms race against superbugs; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Safety: “Smelling” at the nano-scale level to identify hazardous conditions, alert those in danger, and initiate steps to prevent catastrophe; and 
3. | Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using the minimal amounts of safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods, and avoiding using harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible. 

 
In 2016, we introduced into the institutional market a hygienic product that creates surfaces unfriendly to germs. This is expected to be part of a family of cleaning products that protect and fortify surfaces at the nanoscale-level. The patent-pending product is a spray that cleans, penetrates and fortifies the surface. The product is safe for use on many surfaces, both natural and man-made. After application, the product continues to fortify and protect, keeping a clean and healthy surface.
 
Our product is made with safe ingredients and does not use harsh chemicals or disinfectants. We start with a natural mineral that is milled and engineered into a smaller shape and size. Then, the milled mineral is mixed with a proprietary cleaner solution to create our product. The mineral chosen is stable in air and water. No governmental approvals are required for sale of this product. The product:
 

● | Rids the surface of dust, dirt and debris; 
--+-----------------------------------------------
● | Leaves a healthy surface 
● | Is safe to use 
● | Continues to work after application; 
● | Is fast-acting; 
● | Is non-corrosive; 
● | Is easy to apply; 
● | Is non-flammable; 
● | Is environmentally friendly; 
● | Is odor free; and 
● | Is stain free. 

 
We believe that our manufacturing capacity and contractors with whom we have established relationships will enable us to fill orders for the new product. Ingredients and packaging materials are readily available from a number of suppliers.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
We sell our consumer products directly to retailers in the United States and work with outside agents and distributors. Our industrial products are sold directly to customers who frequently use our products in their own branded products.
Manufacturing Operations
 
We do a limited amount of packaging and labeling at our 26,000-square foot facility in Brooklyn Heights Ohio. Most of our production is done by third-party contract bottlers and package manufacturers in the United States.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our nanotechnology expertise and related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science, molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, and surfactants. The intellectual property developed from this work is protected with a combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is like that used by leading companies in the fragrance and flavors industry. No single patent is significant to any of our commercial products.
Competition
 
Products sold into the optical segment have a small number of significant competitors. Our products are known to be the “benchmark” products in these segments and generally outperform our competitors’. Some of our products in these segments do compete for certain customers or certain applications against lower priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling products into these market segments are privately-held, U.S. packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. include Hilco Accessories, California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories and, internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China. In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product line we are not aware of any competitive products that match our product performance or processing characteristics.
 
Products sold into the hygienic, germ-unfriendly market have a diverse variety of potential competitors. Potential competitors fall into the general category of germ-killing cleaners, known as disinfectants. These disinfectants rely on the use of government-approved pesticides as their active ingredient. Examples include bleach, benzalkonium chloride, and alcohols. All disinfectant products require the use of protective gloves and masks for their safe use. Examples in the U.S. include the Clorox Company, GOJO Industries, Inc., and Reckitt Benckiser, Inc. Since our products do not include germ-killing pesticides and do not require protective clothing, it is unclear how customers will perceive our products as compared to these potential competitors.
 
Backlog
 
Sales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any date is indicative of future results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified period, but these agreements do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. The quantities purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer’s delay of a product shipment can make a difference in the results for an accounting period.
Geographical Information
 
All long-lived assets are in the United States.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
We use third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the United States to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging products. Over time, one unrelated third party has become our leading supplier in the United States. As is customary in our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers and have generally made purchases through purchase orders. Due to to our decision to utilize toll packaging companies in the manufacture of many of our products, we now have a one year contract with one supplier giving that supplier substantially exclusive rights to two of our SKUs. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers and that there are alternative sources should one or more of these suppliers or manufacturers become unavailable. However, the disruption of our operations if a change becomes necessary and the likelihood of shipment delays means that the loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our key suppliers or manufacturers, or any other supply change disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Key Customers
 
A limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue. Revenues from two customers constituted approximately 27% and 12% of 2017 total revenue, and 30% and 14% of 2016 total revenue. Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, may be able to exert a high degree of influence over us. The loss of one of the largest customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Contract Services Segment
 
Our Contract services segment functions as the Design center for our new products as well as performing work for government agencies and private strategic partners. Formerly called the research and development segment, this segment has moved away from areas of research that do not involve product development, especially government contracts that require us to fund part of the research cost. This segment is now involved in proof of concepts and prototypes for proposed PEN products and development work under contract for government and private entities. In our work on products for PEN we focus only on submicron size particles, not smaller nanoparticles that are subject to much greater government regulation. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:

● | Nanosensor technology; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Nanoelectronics; and 
● | Submicron particle formulations and materials for health and safety products. 

 
Much of our contract product development work is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done. With private development contracts, there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under the contract. Our short-term goal when we work for others is to cover all out of pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead. Our long-term goal is to become a trusted supplier of products to our development partners.
 
We have had small scale success with commercial sales of conductive inks and pastes and from thermal management materials. Our graphene foils are also sold commercially but the size of the market is small. Product sales typically come from repeat business or from customer inquiries in our areas of expertise.
 
We continue to focus on stabilizing our financial situation and operating this segment at break-even or better based solely on revenues from our development activities.
 
Nanoelectronics Applications – Inks and Pastes
 
Metallic Inks & Pastes
 
Copper Inks - As flexible electronics grow, soldering is disappearing. New digital and additive manufacturing processes allow industries to move from the design process directly to the production line. We believe that only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing.
 
We sell copper inks and pastes to a variety of customers around the world. Certain of our products based on nano-copper are available only outside Asia under agreements with our former research partner Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., that has exclusive rights in Asia to patents developed under research contracts with them. Other copper products that we sell are available worldwide.
 
Other metallic inks – Our technology and development work in conductive inks also resulted in conductive inks and pastes using nickel, silver, and aluminum rather than copper. Research partners who funded some of our work using silver and aluminum have exclusive rights to certain products for solar applications. We are not restricted in using products for other applications, and we can sell into the solar field our products that do not infringe those specific patents.
 
There are silver inks on the market today, but because of the high cost of silver relative to copper, a successful copper or copper-alloy ink is likely to be of greater commercial interest to potential customers. Most inks and pastes sold in commercial quantities today are manufactured and sold by large multinational chemical companies. For example, the two largest suppliers of inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro. We are unable to compete directly with companies of that size in established silver ink markets.
 
Technical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS)
 
Conductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes. In addition to traditional 2D printing applications, we developed a multifunctional copper ink for 3D printing applications, the fastest growing segment of printed electronics.
 
Numerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive inks and pastes. The commercialization of products using our technology depends on the results of our development work compared with results achieved by others, as well as other factors including raw material costs, marketing, resources, and production capabilities.
 
Sensors
 
Our approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. Our competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas where we are currently active are:

7
-


Ion Mobility Sensors. We are developing sensors based on Ion Mobility Sensor (“IMS”) technology focusing on Differential Mobility Spectroscopy (“DMS”). These sensors are ideal for use when both high sensitivity and high selectivity (low false positives) are required. We have improved on existing IMS and DMS technology by developing our proprietary nonradioactive gas ionization sources to replace the radioactive isotopes that are traditionally used in these tools.
 
We are also working on sensors for detection of citrus greening disease with collaboration from the California Citrus Research Board and funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
 
Hydrogen and Methane Sensors. Hydrogen sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. Currently, we are not aware of commercial interest in hydrogen sensors.
 
Methane gas detectors that we developed for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association have achieved UL 1484 certification for Residential Gas Detectors. In 2017, the Northeast Gas Association began a field test of these sensors that is ongoing.
 
Carbon Monoxide Sensors. We have developed a low-power carbon monoxide sensor that can last for 10,000 hours on a single battery. The sensor will be specific to carbon monoxide with no cross sensitivity to other gases and elements and is also easily portable and highly sensitive.
 
Submicron Particle Formulations and Materials for Health and Safety Applications
 
Our work in the health and safety area builds on our understanding of certain compounds from our extensive work related to inks and pastes. The understanding of the chemistry of these particles and their interaction with surfactants and other solutions was combined with research and development work done for products already sold commercially resulted in new product concepts and materials with superior properties for applications in the field of health and safety.
 
Using our experience with metallic inks and our prior work with carbon nanotube composites we developed a new thin carbon foil made of layers of graphene for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals used by the medical field in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. We supply graphene foil to institutional customers who make nuclear pharmaceuticals, and our partners are testing our graphene windows for use in their equipment. The extent to which our partners are successful in the nuclear pharmaceutical marketplace is outside our control.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
An important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and, when appropriate, we seek patent protection for our products and proprietary technology. Historically, we made filings in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. Beginning in 2014, as a cost saving measure, we became much more selective in filing patents and reduced the number of jurisdictions where we act to protect our rights. Still, our patent portfolio consists of approximately 40 patents, including issued patents and patent applications pending before foreign and United States Patent and Trademark Offices. Trade secret protection is also important to our products.
 
The patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance that our pending United States and foreign applications will issue, or what scope of protection any issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a legal challenge. Interference proceedings, to determine priority of invention, also could arise in any of our pending patent applications. The costs of such proceedings would be significant and an unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings. If we fail to obtain patents, there can be no assurance that we can protect our rights in the technology, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our technology.
 
Competitors have filed applications for, or have been issued patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, we could potentially challenge the validity of the other patent but would need to overcome a presumption of validity. If we were found to infringe and the patent was held valid (or was unchallenged), there can be no assurance that the prevailing party would grant us a license. Even if a license were available, the payments that would be required are unknown and could materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products.

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets.
 
We require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual through the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
Government Contracts
 
A portion of our revenue in the Contract services segment consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. Our revenue from government contracts was $750,160 and $807,823 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These reimbursements represent all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2017, we have several government contracts in process that have approximately $809,047 of revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk of cancellation. Also, government contractors generally are subject to various kinds of audits and investigations by government agencies. These audits and investigations involve review of a contractor’s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs incurred and compliance with all laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and we do not expect the results of any government audit to have a significant effect on our operations or our financial statements.
Research and Development
 
Research and development activity is the driver for our new products and improvement of existing products. Research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company’s products was $286,395 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Research and development costs were $290,402 for 2016. This represented approximately 9.6% and 8.2% of our total operating costs in each of those years. The ability to engineer product performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Product research and development work includes development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied both by hand and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing processes and techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer’s use of the product.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other state and local regulations, including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. Some of our research work, and products developed may also be subject to regulation under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We take these requirements into account in product development. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future.
 
OSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can affect timing of sales which may be significant in an accounting period.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 15 full-time employees. We do not anticipate the need to hire significant additional employees to support our existing business. If product sales increase, or we begin to see commercial sales of new products, we plan to hire additional employees in sales and marketing. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
