ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 Midwest Holding Inc. (“Midwest,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) was formed in Nebraska in 2003 as a financial services holding company. Our sole operating subsidiary, American Life & Security Corp. (“American Life”), is a Nebraska-domiciled life insurance company. The principal executive offices for Midwest and American Life are at 2900 South 70th Street, Suite 400, Lincoln, Nebraska 68506, phone number (402) 489-8266.
 As of December 31, 2018, statutory capital and surplus of American Life was approximately $21.0 million and it had a “B++” (“Good”) A.M. Best rating.
 Development of Business in 2018
 Our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 was transformative for us in our recapitalization, management and control and future plan of operations.
 Change in Control in 2018 and Adoption of New Business Plan
 Change in Control.
 On June 28, 2018 we underwent a change in control as a result of the closing of a Loan, Convertible Preferred Stock and Convertible Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement dated May 9, 2018 (the “Agreement”) with a non-affiliated third party, Xenith Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Xenith”). Xenith is a wholly controlled subsidiary of Vespoint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Vespoint”), which is also the manager of Xenith. Vespoint is owned and managed by AMS Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Rendezvous Capital LLC, a New York limited liability company. Each of these three companies is a private investment company; they are controlled by A. Michael Salem and Michael Minnich, who are Co-Chief Executive Officers of Vespoint.
 The terms and conditions of the Agreement are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 14, 2018. The Agreement was filed as an exhibit to the referenced Current Report on Form 8-K.
 Issuance of Class C Convertible Preferred Stock. At the closing of the Agreement, we issued 1,500,000 shares of newly created Class C Convertible Preferred Stock (“Class C Preferred Stock”) to Xenith for $1,500,000. The Class C Preferred Stock is convertible, at Xenith’s election, into approximately 72,900,000 shares of our voting common stock at approximately $0.02 per share, and ranks senior to the Common Stock on liquidation with a preference of $1.00 per share. Subject to the availability of funds, annual dividends of 8% of the Class C Preferred Stock liquidation preference are payable by us; if not paid the dividends accrue. Also, at any time after June 28, 2025 and subject to Nebraska law, Xenith may require us to redeem the Class C Preferred Stock at the liquidation preference (plus accrued dividends) or fair market value, whichever is greater. If the shares are not redeemed for any reason, an interest rate of 12% per year begins. Holders of Class C Preferred Stock voting as a separate class are entitled to elect five of eight members of our Board of Directors, with holders of voting common stock entitled to elect the other three directors; otherwise, the Class C Preferred Stock votes with the voting common stock as a single class on an “as converted” basis.
 5

Loans from Xenith. The Agreement also provided that Xenith could loan up to $23,500,000 to us pursuant to notes convertible into voting common stock at approximately $0.02 per share. The following table sets forth information regarding loans made to us by Xenith through December 31, 2018:
  
 | | | | Shares of Common | | 
-----------------+-----------+------------+------------------+------------------+--------------------+---------------
 | Loan | | Stock into which | | 
 | Principal | | Loan May be | | 
Date of Loan | Amount | | Converted | | Loan Maturity Date
June 28, 2018 | $ | 500,000 | | 24,284,825 | | July 31, 2028 
June 28, 2018 | | 100,000 | | 4,856,965 | | July 31, 2028 
October 10, 2018 | | 1,000,000 | | 48,569,650 | | April 20, 2028
December 7, 2018 | | 17,500,000 | | 849,968,875 | | April 20, 2028
Total | $ | 19,100,000 | | 927,680,315 | | 

 The notes are secured under a security agreement which is collateralized by all of the issued and outstanding shares of American Life. Xenith has the right to foreclose on the collateral under events of default, which include our failure to pay interest or principal on the notes when due, failure to observe any material provision of the Agreement, misrepresentations under the Agreement or bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving us. All interest on the notes through January 31, 2019 has been waived.
 Management Additions. At the closing of the Agreement, Xenith appointed three members to American Life’s five-person board of directors including Messrs. Salem and Minnich, who were each subsequently appointed as the Chairman and President, respectively, of American Life. Mr. Salem is an insurance executive and an insurance/financial consultant. Mr. Minnich is an insurance advisor and investment manager.
 Also, upon closing of the Agreement, American Life entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Salem and Minnich and we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Mark A. Oliver.
 Increased Capitalization. In connection with the Agreement, an amendment to increase the number of shares of our capital stock was approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders held on November 13, 2018. The total number of shares of capital stock of all classes of which we have authority to issue is now 2,000,000,000, consisting of 1,970,000,000 shares of voting common stock, 20,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
 New Business Plan.
 Following the closing of the Agreement, we began implementation of a new business plan whose primary purpose is to leverage technology and reinsurance to distribute competitive insurance products through third party marketing organizations.
 Reinsurance of our Legacy Insurance Business. In conjunction with the implementation of our new business plan, on December 10, 2018, American Life closed an Assumption and Indemnity Reinsurance Agreement with United Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated Texas insurance company. Terms of the agreement were described in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on November 16, 2018. At the closing, American Life received net proceeds of $3.5 million from this reinsurer who also assumed substantially all of American Life’s existing life insurance and annuity policies.
 The Business Plan. In 2018, subsequent to the change in control described above, we embarked upon our new business plan to become a leading, technology-enabled, services-oriented insurance company. Our objective is to leverage American Life, and its technology, state licenses where we are permitted to sell life insurance and annuity products (currently 11), product-development and administration-capabilities, “B++” (“Good”) A.M. Best rating, relationships and reputation to create and sell life and annuity products through third party independent marketing organizations with substantially less risk retention via reinsurance with third party reinsurers. Our targeted third party field marketing organizations offer products, infrastructure and other services to independent insurance agents across the United States. Reinsurers will assume most of the insurance risk of the written policies through reinsurance agreements. In exchange for these “program” arrangements we will earn ceding fees from the reinsurers. We currently offer one multi-year guaranteed annuity (“MYGA”) product through two independent marketing organizations.

Our operating goals are to create value through our ability to compete in the areas of:
 
● | Product innovation; 
--+-----------------------------------
● | Speed to market; 
● | Rates and commissions; 
● | Customer and agent experience; and
● | Ease and cost of doing business. 

 Technology. As an integral part of our new business plan, American Life implemented and integrated a modern technology platform designed to facilitate our business. American Life contracted with a third-party software company to license a new policy administration system known as “FAST,” an end-to-end product development, new business, distribution management and policy administration platform that utilizes state-of-the-art technology that American Life hosts in the Amazon Web Services cloud. Functional implementation was completed in November 2018, and testing completed in January 2019. In addition, several core technology integrations were added, including document management, electronic application capability, secure log-ins and an agent and policyholder portal. Management believes this new technology should enhance cost effective product sales and development and policy administration, as well as provide American Life with the ability to seek to expand its third party administrative services (which have been a minor part of our legacy business) in the future.
 Products. We presently offer one product, a multi-year guaranteed annuity (“MYGA”), but expect to expand our annuity product line and introduce other insurance products into the market in order to meet perceived market demand.
 Depending on market demand, we would expect to write a wide variety of insurance products, including fixed deferred, fixed indexed and other annuities in addition to term life and Medicare supplemental insurance. Using our model, we believe we can generate gross written premiums on a relatively small capital base compared to traditional insurance carriers.
 Future Product Development. Our business plan for at least 2019 and 2020 is to develop additional insurance products in close consultation with Milliman, our independent consulting actuary and insurance marketing organizations ("IMOs") that we believe have an in-depth understanding of the demands of the marketplace. Our goal is to create and adjust products quickly and cost effectively where we perceive (i) market demand, (ii) interest from IMOs and (iii) available qualified reinsurance companies. We may offer products exclusively through third party marketing organizations that we work with to develop products – giving them a competitive advantage.
 In conjunction with our MYGA product launch in January 2019, we executed selling agreements with two national field marketing organizations, that contract with independent agents throughout the United States. The field marketing organizations are responsible for recruitment and training of independent agents, although American Life has additional requirements that each agent complete courses in anti-money laundering, annuity products and annuity suitability, along with a specific training class on our products.
 Any new product must be approved by the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities before being sold.
 Our new MYGA product was developed using the services of an independent qualified consulting actuary, Milliman, and any new products will utilize similar services. In addition to product development, the consulting actuary will serve as valuation actuary to American Life in 2019. Milliman also handles compliance and filings with various regulatory authorities.
 Reinsurance. Generally, when it is cost effective, we expect to reinsure most of the risks associated with our policies. Our reinsurers may be domestic, foreign or capital markets investors seeking to assume U.S. insurance business. We plan to mitigate the credit risk relating to reinsurers generally by either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized reinsurers or requiring that the reinsurer post substantial collateral or make other financial commitments to secure the reinsured risks. It should be noted that American Life will remain exposed to the credit risk of reinsurers, or the risk that one or more reinsurers becomes insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims.
 In a typical reinsurance transaction, we will receive a ceding commission plus an ongoing fee for the administration of the business. In some cases, our reinsurers may not be “accredited” or qualified as reinsurers under Nebraska Law and in order to permit transactions with reinsurers and to reduce potential credit risk, we may hold a deposit or withhold funds from the reinsurer or require the reinsurer to maintain a trust that holds assets backing up the reinsurer’s obligation to pay claims on the business it assumes. In some cases, the reinsurer may appoint an investment manager to manage these assets pursuant to guidelines approved by us that are consistent with state investment statutes and regulations relating to reinsurance. We expect there would be a monthly or quarterly settlement of premiums, claims, surrenders and collateral.
 Underwriting and Suitability. Because our initial product has limited mortality and morbidity risk, our current underwriting focus is based on applicability and suitability of products for the insurance client. We have worked with Milliman, MVP Advisors and Regulatory Insurance Advisors, LLC to develop appropriate suitability guidelines that provide for an evaluation of the: (i) purpose for a client’s selection of a product, (ii) the financial resources of the client/owner, (iii) the age of the client and (iv) the duration of the product and (v) the overall fit for the client. This information is captured through a questionnaire completed with the application and undergoes review at both the field marketing organizations and home office level. Final determinations regarding underwriting are made by our home office staff.

Competition. The life and annuity insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of the life insurance companies authorized to do business in states where we conduct business are well-established companies with good reputations, offer a broader line of insurance products, have larger selling organizations, and possess significantly greater financial resources than Midwest and American Life.
 Although we face significant competition on a product-by-product basis, we believe our general business model can compete for insurance business due to our use of technology and small size, which should enable us to be nimble and adapt rapidly to changing insurance market conditions, together with the relationships that have been developed with field marketing organizations. Furthermore, American Life received a rating of B++ from A.M. Best in 2018, which we believe is a prerequisite to attract marketing organizations to sell its insurance products.
 Geographic Distribution. American Life is licensed to underwrite and market life insurance and annuity products in 11 states. It is seeking to expand its licenses in at least 24 additional states in 2019.
 Accounting. Our operating results are reported in accordance with GAAP for stock life companies; although American Life also prepares financial statements – and primarily manages its business – in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by Nebraska, its state of domicile (statutory basis of accounting) for the purpose of reporting to insurance regulatory authorities and its rating agency. The statutory basis of accounting has many significant differences to GAAP. For example, the incremental ceding commissions earned by American Life through reinsurance of new business, which are amortized under GAAP, are earned immediately under the statutory basis of accounting.
 Investments. The type and amount of investments that can be made by a life insurance company are specifically controlled by applicable state statutes and rules and regulations of the respective state departments of insurance. American Life has adopted investment policies in compliance with the insurance laws of the State of Nebraska.
 American Life has a long-term investment policy aimed at protecting capital and earning attractive risk adjusted returns while insuring compliance with Nebraska’s insurance investment laws. Our investments are managed by our senior management team, who have many years of asset management experience. Trades are cleared through a common broker after competitive prices are solicited.
 Reserves. American Life establishes as liabilities actuarially computed reserves to meet the obligations on the policies it writes, in accordance with the insurance laws and the regulations of Nebraska, for statutory accounting and GAAP. Reserves, whether calculated under statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators or GAAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our good faith estimates based on the relevant basis of accounting, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality, longevity and lapse assumptions. The various actuarial factors are determined from mortality tables and interest rates in effect when the policies are issued and are applied against policy in force amounts. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has adopted reserve rules to be used for Statutory Accounting. As of October 31, 2017, 47 states adopted the revised model laws. The new method, referred to as Principle-Based Reserving (“PBR”) replaces the current formula approach on determining policy reserves to an approach that reflects the risk of highly complex products. American Life did not report life insurance reserves on a PBR basis at December 31, 2018 and is deferring to implement under the transitional rules stated in Section II of the Valuation Manual until January 1, 2020 for new policies written. We have not performed an analysis to determine the effect these new rules may have on us.
 Regulation. In 2018, we coinsured substantially all of our legacy business to third-party reinsurers. Through the process, we transferred the underlying policy reserves and received a ceding commission in exchange.
 Beginning in 2019, with the launch of our MYGA product and other potential products, we expect to reinsure most of our new business production to third-party reinsurers as discussed above under “Reinsurance,” which will be subject to regulation as described above.
 American Life is subject to the regulation and supervision of the insurance regulatory authorities of Nebraska, and other state insurance regulators where it is licensed to do business. Such regulation is primarily for the benefit of policyholders rather than shareholders. These regulators possess broad administrative powers, including the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, to approve the form of insurance contracts, to regulate capital requirements, to regulate the character of permitted investments, and to require deposits for the protection of investments. These insurance laws require the filing of a detailed annual report with the department of insurance in each state, as do other states’ laws. The business and financial accounts of American Life are subject to examination by the Nebraska Department of Insurance, as well as insurance departments of any other states in which we may do business.

As the holder of a controlling interest in American Life, we are also subject to regulation as an insurance holding company system under the insurance laws of the state of Nebraska. The provisions of these laws generally provide for restrictions on a change in control of the insurance holding company, requires the filing of certain reports with the relevant department of insurance, and limits the amount of dividends which may be received by the holding company.
 Financial Reform. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became law. The Dodd-Frank Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms, and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Dodd-Frank Act will be subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking that may take several years to complete. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder will have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.
 Tax Reform. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 is referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“New Tax Act”). The New Tax Act made fundamental changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impacted the Company. The primary impact on our 2018 financial results was associated with the effect of reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% which required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower rate at December 22, 2017, the date of enactment. Other provisions of the New Tax Act that will impact us but are not effective until January 1, 2018, include, but are not limited to: 1) provisions reducing the dividends received deduction; 2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); 3) changing the rules regarding use of net operating losses; and 4) changing the way in which tax reserves will be measured.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018 we had 17 full-time employees. We conduct our insurance sales through third party field marketing organizations.
 Third-Party Services
 As a small part of our business over the past several years we have provided third party administrative services (“TPA”) to insurance providers. As part of our new business plan we expect to seek to expand this area of our business through leveraging our technology infrastructure and expertise in seeking to provide specialty administration services to other insurers. In 2018 we provided TPA services to two customers.
