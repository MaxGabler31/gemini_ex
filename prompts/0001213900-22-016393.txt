 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.



Overview



Our Company is a content-driven and technology-enabled shopping destination for appliances, furniture and home goods.



Our goal is to give customers a wide array of choices and an unparalleled experience through detail on the best brands, volume purchasing, and rebates with manufacturer discounts, supported by human customer service agents.
Corporate History and Structure



Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 10, 2019, to form an acquisition platform. In April 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Goedeker Television, a brick and mortar operation with an online presence serving the St. Louis metro area. Since that acquisition, we have grown into a nationwide omnichannel retailer. Through our June 2021 acquisition of Appliances Connection, we have evolved into a growth-oriented e-commerce platform, offering an expansive selection of household appliances throughout the United States. In July 2021, we added to our platform by acquiring Appliances Gallery. With warehouse fulfillment centers in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as showrooms in Brooklyn, New York, Largo, Florida and St. Louis, Missouri, we offer one-stop shopping for national and global brands. We carry many household name-brands, including Bosch, Cafe, Frigidaire Pro, Whirlpool, LG, and Samsung, and many major luxury appliance brands such as Miele, Thermador, La Cornue, Dacor, Ilve, Jenn-Air and Viking, among others. We also sell furniture, fitness equipment, plumbing fixtures, televisions, outdoor appliances, and patio furniture, as well as commercial appliances for builder and business clients.
Key Acquisitions



Acquisition of Goedeker Television



On April 5, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Goedeker Television (the “Goedeker Television Acquisition”). As a result of this transaction, we acquired the former business of Goedeker Television, which was founded in 1951, and continue to operate this business. Prior to the Goedeker Television Acquisition, we had no operations other than operations relating to our incorporation and organization.
Acquisition of Appliances Connection



Appliances Connection was founded in 1998 by Albert Fouerti and Elie Fouerti and is one of the leading retailers of household appliances. In addition to selling appliances, it also sells furniture, fitness equipment, plumbing fixtures, televisions, outdoor appliances, and patio furniture, as well as commercial appliances for builder and business clients. It also provides appliance installation services and old appliance removal services. Appliances Connection serves retail customers, builders, architects, interior designers, restaurants, schools and other large corporations. We completed the Appliances Connection acquisition on June 2, 2021, for an aggregate purchase price of $224.7 million, consisting of (i) $180.0 million in cash, (ii) 5,895,973 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $12.3 million, and (iii) $32.4 million as a result of the post-closing net working capital adjustment provision. We recorded $0.9 million in acquisition related expenses. As co-founders of Appliances Connection, Albert Fouerti and Elie Fouerti were both significant stockholders of Appliances Connection. Albert Fouerti joined our board of directors in June 2021 and became our Chief Executive Officer on August 30, 2021. Elie Fouerti serves as our Chief Operating Officer.



In connection with our acquisition of Appliances Connection, the sellers agreed not to compete with the business of 1 Stop for two years following the acquisition.



The Appliances Connection purchase agreement also contained customary demand and “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to the shares issued to the sellers. Each seller entered into a lock-up agreement not to transfer or assign or otherwise dispose of the shares that were issued to that seller for 180 days after the closing, which period expired on November 29, 2021, and thereafter the seller is permitted to sell shares at a rate of no more than one percent of our outstanding stock per quarter until the one year anniversary of the closing of the Appliances Connection Acquisition.



Please also see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” for certain risks related to the Appliances Connection Acquisition.

Acquisition of AC Gallery



On July 29, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of, Appliance Gallery, Inc., a retail appliance store in Largo, Florida (“Appliance Gallery”), for a total purchase price of $1.4 million.



Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic



Starting in late 2019, COVID-19 began to rapidly spread around the world and every state in the United States. Most states and cities have at various times instituted quarantines, restrictions on travel, “stay at home” rules, social distancing measures and restrictions on the types of businesses that could continue to operate as well as guidance in response to the pandemic. Since a majority of our sales are completed online and our call center, warehouse and distribution operations and Appliances Connection’s retail facilities and warehouse have continued to operate, the restrictions put in place in response to COVID-19 have not had a material negative impact on those operations. However, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we may be required to close or limit service offerings in our retail facilities or warehouses in response to guidance from applicable government and public health officials, which could adversely affect our operations and revenues.



In addition, we are dependent upon suppliers to provide us with all of the products that we sell. The pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact suppliers, manufacturers and the overall supply chain of certain products. As a result, we have faced, and may continue to face, delays or difficulty sourcing certain products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more and adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.



The global deterioration in economic conditions, which may have an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending, could also impact our business. For instance, consumer spending may be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, including a rise in unemployment, increased inflation, and decreased consumer confidence resulting from the pandemic and other economic conditions. Changing consumer behaviors as a result of the pandemic may also have a material impact on revenue. Furthermore, the spread of COVID-19 has adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result, in a significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital in the future, which could negatively affect our liquidity.



If the spread of COVID-19 is not contained, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. We expect that government and health authorities may announce new or alter existing restrictions, which could require us to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. We may also experience limitations in employee resources. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees are suspected of having COVID-19, which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of facilities for disinfection. The duration of any business disruption cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our ability to operate our business and result in additional costs.



The extent to which the pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and steps taken to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others. See also Item 1A “Risk Factors” for more information.



Industry



The U.S. major home appliances market is highly fragmented with big box retailers, online retailers, and thousands of local and regional retailers competing for share in what has historically been a high touch sale process. According to Statista, revenue in the U.S. major household appliances market (excluding small appliances) is projected to reach $23.2 billion in 2022 and grow at an annual growth rate of 3.08% from 2022 to 2026.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 76 million households in the United States with annual incomes over $25,000 aged between 25 and 65 years, many of whom are accustomed to purchasing goods online. As younger generations age, start new families and move into new homes, we expect online sales of household appliances to increase. In addition, we believe the online household appliances market will further grow as older generations of consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing online, particularly if the process is easy and efficient.



Our Products



We sell a vast assortment of household appliances, including refrigerators, ranges, ovens, dishwashers, microwaves, freezers, washers and dryers. In addition to appliances, we also offer a broad assortment of products in the furniture, décor, bed & bath, lighting, outdoor living, electronics categories, fitness equipment, plumbing fixtures, air conditioners, fireplaces, fans, dehumidifiers, humidifiers, air purifiers and televisions. While these are not individually high-volume categories, they complement the appliance to produce a one-stop home goods offering for customers.



Vendor/Supplier Relationships



We offer more than 700 vendors and over 500,000 SKUs available for purchase through our website. We believe that this depth of vendor relationships gives consumers numerous options in all product categories resulting in a true one-stop shopping destination. Our principal vendors and suppliers are Frigidaire, General Electric, LG, Whirlpool, Bosch, Viking, Miele, Samsung, Fisher Paykel and Ilve.



During the year ended December 31, 2021, Frigidaire and GE brands accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of product purchases. No other supplier accounted for more than 10% of our purchases in the years ended December 31, 2021.



We are a member and 5% equity interest holder of Dynamic Marketing, Inc. (“DMI”), a 60-member appliance purchasing cooperative. DMI purchases consumer electronics and appliances at wholesale prices from various vendors, and then makes such products available to its members, who sell such products to end consumers. DMI’s purchasing group arrangement provides its members with leverage and purchasing power with appliance vendors, and increases our ability to compete with competitors, including big box appliance and electronics retailers. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased a substantial portion of finished goods from DMI, representing 72.1% and 22.1% of purchases, respectively.



Our business model allows us to constantly review and evaluate each supplier relationship, and we are open to building new supplier/vendor relationships. Products are purchased from all suppliers on an at-will basis. Relationships with suppliers are subject to change from time to time. Please see Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a description of the risks related to our supplier relationships.



Marketing



Our marketing efforts drive new and repeat customers and promote our websites as online communities relating to major appliances and other products. Our strategy is to inspire the customer at each point of their shopping journey, delivering curated messaging, content and advice in an effort to increase engagement and repeat purchasing. We utilize a combination of paid and earned media, including search engine marketing, email, digital display, social media, retargeting, radio and events, in our media strategy. We also have programs to engage appliance enthusiasts and build community through design and customer portals that are intended both to inspire and provide help the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) customers with their projects.

Customers and Markets



We have physical stores and warehouses located in Brooklyn, New York, Somerset, New Jersey, Hamilton, New Jersey, St. Charles, Missouri and Largo, Florida. Our internal logistics network and third-party distribution, delivery and installation agreements allow us to serve, sell and ship to customers nationwide. The diagram below represents our sales by region for 2021:
Logistics



In our fulfillment of large durable goods, we have created an infrastructure that allows us to deliver products in most states. We want to scale this infrastructure by continuing to improve execution, fulfillment center locations, and delivery timing. This proprietary logistic process enables us to provide our customers’ products quickly and to provide a better shipping and delivery experience than they might otherwise experience. Additionally, we believe this logistics network will help us reduce expenses, touchpoints, damages and returns.
Technology



We are continuing to build out our custom-built, proprietary technology and operational platform to deliver the best experience for both our customers and suppliers. Our success has been built on a culture of data-driven decision-making and proprietary software for order management and customer fulfillment. We believe that control of our technology systems, which gives us the ability to update them often, is a competitive advantage. Our team of engineers has built a technology solution for durable goods. Our software consists of a large set of tools and systems with which our customers directly interact, that are specifically tuned for shopping the major appliance category by mixing lifestyle imagery with easy-to-use navigation tools and personalization features designed to increase customer conversion. We have designed operations software to deliver the reliable and consistent experience consumers desire, with proprietary software enhancing our performance in areas such as integration with our suppliers, our warehouse and logistics network and our customer service operation. Much of our customer marketing technology was internally developed, including campaign management and bidding algorithms for online advertising. This allows us to leverage our internal data and target customers efficiently across various channels. We also partner with select marketing and trade partners where we find solutions that meet our marketing objectives and inspire our B2B and B2C customers.
Competition



While we are primarily focused on the online U.S. appliances, furniture and other home goods market, we compete across all segments of the market. Our competition includes online retailers and marketplaces, furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores and specialty retailers. As an omnichannel retailer, we have been able to navigate consumers’ shift to increased online purchasing as a result of COVID-19 and provide competitive offerings with that of our competitors.
Competitive Strengths



Consumer research, shopping and buying habits have dramatically changed in the past year. We are well-positioned to take advantage of these unprecedented shifts that we expect will be long-lasting.

The U.S. appliance market is highly fragmented, with thousands of local and regional retailers competing for a share. We believe this fragmented market presents an opportunity to streamline business and make brands and products available to everyone across the country. We are standardizing a consistent end-to-end experience to provide products to the consumer no matter where they are located in the country.



We are strengthening our e-commerce platform and increasing our showroom and distribution center model to provide a smooth path to purchase. We are also investing in our brand presence and marketing efforts to drive customer acquisition and engagement. Our goal is to be the appliance destination for our customers from inspiration to installation.



We offer one of the largest online selections of household appliances, with over tens of thousands of SKU’s in our product offering. In addition, we are in the process of reinventing our brand and have added private label brands to our assortment in 2021. Convenience, value and superior customer service are central to our offering. Our goal is to reduce the friction in shopping for and selecting the right product by providing consumers with the right tools for their shopping and purchasing experience. We seek to build trust with our customers and have realized an increased percentage of repeat customer purchases in 2021.



Our competitive strengths include:




● | Name and reputation. Our Goedeker legacy in offering competitively priced name-brand products and services has been recognized over 50+ years in the business.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product selection and pricing. Our comprehensive product selection and competitive pricing model, with support from inspiration to delivery and installation, means we provide a complete solution for customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong customer relationships. We focus on the needs and experience of customers, whether they are in the market for a replacement, renovation or new construction project. This customer-centric approach is evidenced by our repeat customers, over-indexing the industry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly trained and professional staff. Our team is trained to educate and support customers when selecting and buying products. A large percentage of customer orders involve a phone conversation with a sales team member—a differentiator when competing with online-only companies as well as brick-and-mortar outlets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Website ease of use. Our proprietary, purpose-built technology platform is designed to provide consumers a compelling user experience as they browse, research and purchase our products. We use personalization, based on past browsing and shopping patterns, to create a more engaging consumer interaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary technology and content. Investments in our technology platform create a scalable process and support the customer at every point in the journey, including call center tools, digital marketing optimization, B2B design portals, product reviews and lifestyle content.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies



Our mission is to change the way consumers buy appliances and, in doing so, become the leading online retailer of home appliances. The strategies of the Company to achieve this mission, while increasing value for our stockholders, will include:

● | Rebrand the combined company. Establishing favorable brand equity among consumers and the design trade is central to our growth. We plan to drive brand awareness through strategic omni-channel marketing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strengthening the Company’s Leadership Team. We have made several executive and senior management hires and are continuing to build our talent pool and hire highly-skilled employees. Recruiting top-tier talent at all levels remains a priority, especially as the Company evolves and grows. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secure design and builder trade business. We have created new tools and benefits to engage and simplify appliance shopping and buying for B2B projects with builders, contractors, architects and interior designers who are making or influencing the purchasing decision for their clients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Category expansion and Deeper Connectivity with Customers. We will be adding new, complementary categories and services to our selection to meet our customers’ ever-changing needs. We are in the process of enhancing the content and resources available on our site that will ultimately help us create more meaningful relationships with customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive continued operational excellence. We are committed to improving productivity and profitability through operational initiatives designed to grow revenue and expand margins. Some of our key initiatives for operational excellence include:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Logistics and shipping optimization. We have identified the geographic areas in which we want to establish a presence to reach more customers and further penetrate markets that are experiencing high levels of housing development and home remodeling. Although we currently are holding off on entering into agreements due to inventory and supply chain issues, we expect to add at least two new fulfillment centers over the next year. We believe that adding fulfillment centers in other parts of the country will minimize product touchpoints and damage, as well as expedite delivery. With access to vendor warehouse operations, we expect to capitalize on buying opportunities and capture time-sensitive customers more frequently. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Price optimization. We are building a data-based understanding of price elasticity dynamics, promotional strategies and other price management tools to drive optimized pricing for our products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property



We own several registered domain names, including for our www.goedekers.com website and the Appliances Connection websites www.appliancesconnection.com, 1stopcamera.com, goldcoastappliances.com, and joesappliances.com. The agreements with our suppliers generally provide us with limited, nonexclusive licenses to use the supplier’s trademarks, service marks and trade names for the sole purpose of promoting and selling their products.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. We rely on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for certain content we create. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our executive officers and directors.



As of December 31, 2021, in an effort to protect our brand, we had 4 registered trademarks in the United States.



Human Capital



As of December 31, 2021, we employed 482 total employees, all of which were full-time employees.



We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. Our people are integral to our business, and we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Government Regulation



Our business is subject to the laws of the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions as to how, or whether, laws governing personal privacy, data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among others, apply to the Internet and e-commerce. These laws are continually evolving. For example, certain applicable privacy laws and regulations require us to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act and a “smaller reporting company” within the meaning of the Securities Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.



For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:




● | have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.



We may continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements, including, but not limited to presenting only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
