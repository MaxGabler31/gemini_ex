 Item 1.  Business
 Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) is a diversified telecommunications company providing high-quality communications services to customers with approximately 5.1 million wireless connections and 1.2 million wireline and cable connections at December 31, 2017.  TDS conducts all of its wireless operations through its majority-owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation (U.S. Cellular).  As of December 31, 2017, TDS owned 83% of the combined total of the outstanding Common Shares and Series A Common Shares of U.S. Cellular and controlled 96% of the combined voting power of both classes of U.S. Cellular common stock.  TDS provides broadband, video, voice and hosted and managed services, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TDS Telecommunications LLC (TDS Telecom).  TDS was incorporated in 1968 and changed its state of incorporation from Iowa to Delaware in 1998.  TDS Common Shares trade under the ticker symbol “TDS” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  U.S. Cellular Common Shares trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “USM.”
 Under listing standards of the NYSE, TDS is a “controlled company” as such term is defined by the NYSE.  TDS is a controlled company because over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of TDS is held by the trustees of the TDS Voting Trust.
 Through December 31, 2017, TDS had four business segments: U.S. Cellular and TDS Telecom’s Wireline, Cable, and Hosted and Managed Services (HMS) operations.  TDS operations also include the wholly-owned subsidiary Suttle-Straus, Inc. (Suttle-Straus).  Suttle-Straus’ financial results were not significant to TDS’ operations.  All of TDS’ segments operate only in the United States, except for HMS, which includes an insignificant foreign operation.  
 TDS has re-evaluated internal reporting roles with regard to its HMS business unit and, as a result, will be changing its reportable segments.  Effective January 1, 2018, HMS will be considered a non-reportable segment and will no longer be reported under TDS Telecom.  This change will enable TDS Telecom to continue to successfully execute on the Wireline and Cable segments’ shared strategy to be the preferred service provider in its markets.  Additionally, HMS will be able to leverage TDS’ Corporate IT resources, to improve operations and customer service, and better position itself for growth.  Additional information about TDS’ segments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 18 — Business Segment Information in TDS’ Annual Report to Shareholders, filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.

U.S. CELLULAR OPERATIONS
 General
 U.S. Cellular, incorporated under the state laws of Delaware in 1983, provides wireless telecommunications services to customers with approximately 5.1 million connections in 22 states collectively representing a total population of 32 million.  U.S. Cellular operates in one reportable segment, and all of its wireless operating markets are in the United States.  U.S. Cellular’s strategy is to attract and retain wireless customers through a value proposition comprised of a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing, all provided with a local focus.
Customers, Services and Products
 Customers.  U.S. Cellular provides service to postpaid and prepaid customers from a variety of demographic segments.  U.S. Cellular focuses on retail consumers, government entities, and small-to-mid-size business customers in industries such as construction, retail, agriculture, professional services and real estate.  These customers are served primarily through U.S. Cellular’s retail and direct sales channels.  U.S. Cellular builds customer loyalty by offering high-quality network services, outstanding customer-focused support services, competitive pricing, and other benefits as discussed further in “Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels.”
 Services.  U.S. Cellular’s customers are able to choose from a variety of national plans with voice, messaging and data usage options and pricing that are designed to fit different customer needs, usage patterns and budgets.  Helping a customer find the right plan is an important element of U.S. Cellular’s brand positioning.  In early 2017, U.S. Cellular introduced new Total Plans to postpaid customers that include unlimited offerings and no hidden fees such as overage charges and activation fees.  Business rate plans are designed to meet the unique needs of the business customer.  U.S. Cellular’s national plans price all domestic calls as local calls, regardless of where they are made or received in the United States, with no long distance or roaming charges, made possible by roaming agreements with other wireless carriers.  See “Network Technology, Roaming, and System Design” section below for further discussion related to roaming.
U.S. Cellular’s portfolio of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices is a key part of its strategy to deliver wireless devices that allow customers to stay productive, entertained and connected on the go; these devices are backed by U.S. Cellular’s high-speed networks, including a fourth generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.  U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE network features smartphone messaging, data and internet services that allow customers to access the web and social network sites, e-mail, text, picture and video message, utilize GPS navigation, and browse and download thousands of applications to customize their wireless devices to fit their lifestyles.  U.S. Cellular also offers advanced wireless solutions to consumers and business and government customers, including a growing suite of connected machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions and software applications across the categories of monitor and control (e.g., sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g., e-forms), communication (e.g., enterprise messaging, back-up router for business continuity services) and asset management (e.g., telematics, fleet management).  U.S. Cellular intends to continue to further enhance these offerings for consumer and business customers in 2018 and beyond.
 Devices and Products.  U.S. Cellular offers a comprehensive range of wireless devices such as handsets, tablets, mobile hotspots, home phones and routers for use by its customers.  U.S. Cellular offers wireless devices that are compatible with its 4G LTE and third generation (3G) networks and are compliant with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enhanced wireless 911 requirements.  In addition, U.S. Cellular also offers a wide range of accessories, including wireless basics such as cases, screen protectors, chargers, and memory cards as well as an assortment of consumer electronics such as headphones, smart speakers, wearables and home automation products (e.g., cameras, sensors, and thermostats). 
Throughout 2017, new postpaid handset sales to retail consumers were made under equipment installment plans (EIP) only; business and government customers may continue to purchase equipment under alternative plans subject to a service contract.  For certain installment plans, after a specified period of time or number of payments, the customer may have the right to upgrade to a new device prior to reaching the end of the installment term, thus enabling customers to access the latest smartphones and provide a better overall customer experience.  
 During 2017, U.S. Cellular began to offer accessories for purchase on installment plans. These plans allow new and existing postpaid customers to purchase certain accessories payable over a specified time period. These accessory installment plans are available through U.S. Cellular company-owned retail stores, telesales channels, and agent channels using direct fulfillment with U.S. Cellular’s inventory.
 U.S. Cellular continues to offer device service programs that provide customers a simple process to replace a defective device via direct mail.  U.S. Cellular also offers its Trade-In program where U.S. Cellular buys consumers’ used equipment, Device Protection+ program, which includes overnight delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, Device Protection+ Advanced, which includes 100GB of data backup, TechSupport+, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers.

U.S. Cellular offers a full array of iconic smartphones with options for both Android and iOS customers.  U.S. Cellular continues to bolster its expanding smartphone portfolio with the Samsung Galaxy S® 8/8+, the iPhone® 8 and 8 Plus and X, the LG G6, V30 and K8, and the Motorola Z Force.  Along with the iconic devices, U.S. Cellular supports the larger ecosystem of Samsung and Apple devices, such as the Samsung Gear VR, the Samsung Gear S3 and the Apple Watch Series 3.  For tablets, U.S. Cellular offers the full complement of iPads, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and various other tablets from LG, Samsung, and ZTE.  U.S. Cellular’s smartphone offerings play a significant role in attracting customers and driving data service usage and revenues.  U.S. Cellular also offers additional services and products that utilize the company’s network, including feature phones, mobile hotspots, LTE wireless routers and home phones. 
U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessory products from a number of original equipment manufacturers, including Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG, Kyocera, ZTE, Tessco and Superior.  U.S. Cellular also has relationships with its suppliers to ensure best possible pricing and identifies opportunities for promotional support.  U.S. Cellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure; rather, it contracts with third party providers for the majority of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities.  U.S. Cellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device service programs.
 U.S. Cellular continuously monitors the financial condition of its wireless device and accessory suppliers.  Since U.S. Cellular has a diversified portfolio of products from more than one supplier, U.S. Cellular does not expect the financial condition of any single supplier to affect its ability to offer a competitive portfolio of wireless devices and accessories for sale to customers.
 Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels
 Marketing and Advertising.  U.S. Cellular’s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality wireless network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of services and products built around customer needs at fair prices with a local focus.  U.S. Cellular believes that creating positive relationships with its customers enhances their wireless experience and builds customer loyalty.  U.S. Cellular currently offers several customer-centric programs and services to customers.
To attract potential new customers and retain existing customers, and increase their usage of U.S. Cellular’s services, U.S. Cellular’s advertising is directed at increasing the public awareness of the U.S. Cellular brand, knowledge of the outstanding network that works in places where other carriers do not have coverage, and understanding of the wireless services it offers.  U.S. Cellular supplements its advertising with a focused public relations program that improves overall brand sentiment and awareness, encourages engagement, supports sales of services and products, and builds preference and loyalty for the U.S. Cellular brand.  The approach combines national and local media relations in mainstream and social media channels with market-wide activities, events, and sponsorships. 
 U.S. Cellular focuses its charitable giving on initiatives relevant to consumers in its service areas.  These initiatives include programs that focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) activities for youth in the communities U.S. Cellular serves and often involve collaboration with organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
Customer Service.  U.S. Cellular manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through the development of processes that are customer-friendly, extensive training of frontline sales and support associates and the implementation of retention programs.
 U.S. Cellular currently operates four regional customer care centers in its operating markets with personnel who are responsible for customer service activities, and a national financial services center with personnel who perform credit and other customer payment activities.  U.S. Cellular also contracts with third parties that provide additional customer care and financial services support.
 Sales and Distribution Channels.  U.S. Cellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, third-party national retailers, and independent agents, plus a website and telesales.
 Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers.  As of December 31, 2017, retail sales associates work in 256 U.S. Cellular-operated retail stores and kiosks.  Direct sales representatives sell traditional wireless services as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and M2M products and solutions to medium- and large-sized businesses and government entities.  Additionally, the U.S. Cellular website enables customers to activate service and purchase wireless devices online.
 U.S. Cellular maintains an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of retail sales associates and direct sales representatives by focusing their efforts on obtaining customers by facilitating the sale of appropriate packages for the customer’s expected usage and value-added services that meet the individual needs of the customer.

U.S. Cellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for U.S. Cellular on a commission basis.  At December 31, 2017, U.S. Cellular had contracts with these businesses aggregating 455 locations.  U.S. Cellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience.  U.S. Cellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service packages and other related products.  No single agent accounted for 10% or more of U.S. Cellular’s operating revenues during the past three years.
 U.S. Cellular services and products also are offered through third-party national and on-line retailers.  Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club, and Dollar General offer U.S. Cellular services and products at select retail locations in U.S. Cellular’s service areas.  Further, Amazon offers U.S. Cellular’s postpaid and prepaid services on-line.  U.S. Cellular continues to explore new relationships with additional third-party retailers as part of its strategy to expand distribution.
 Seasonality.  Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter.  U.S. Cellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.
 Competition
 The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive.  U.S. Cellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets.  In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which U.S. Cellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).  In its footprint, U.S. Cellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile USA, in addition to a few smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint.  All of the national competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than U.S. Cellular.  In addition, U.S. Cellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products.
Since each of these wireless competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service.  U.S. Cellular employs a customer satisfaction strategy that includes maintaining an outstanding wireless network throughout its markets.  U.S. Cellular owns and operates low-band spectrum (less than 1 GHz) that covers the majority of its footprint and enables more efficient coverage in rural areas (compared to spectrum above 1 GHz), which strengthens its network quality positioning.  To the extent existing competitors or new entrants acquire such spectrum in U.S. Cellular markets, U.S. Cellular could face increased competition over time from competitors that hold such more-efficient low-band spectrum.
 The use of national advertising and promotional programs by the top four wireless service providers is a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures in all U.S. Cellular markets, even if those operators do not provide direct service in a particular market.  Over the past year, competition among top carriers has continued to be aggressive, with the top four carriers offering unlimited plans as well as engaging in rich promotional initiatives including device price reductions.  In addition, in the current wireless environment, U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to offer national voice and data plans.  U.S. Cellular provides wireless services comparable to the national competitors, but the national wireless companies operate in a wider geographic area and are able to provide such services over a wider area on their own networks than U.S. Cellular can offer on its network.  Although U.S. Cellular offers similar coverage area as these competitors, U.S. Cellular incurs roaming charges for data sessions and calls made in portions of the coverage area which are not part of its network, thereby increasing its cost of operations.  U.S. Cellular depends on roaming agreements with other wireless carriers to provide voice and data roaming capabilities in areas not covered by U.S. Cellular’s network.  Similarly, U.S. Cellular provides roaming services on its network to other wireless carriers’ customers who travel within U.S. Cellular’s coverage areas and receives revenue from other carriers for the provision of these services.
 Convergence of connectivity is taking place on many levels, including wireless devices that can act as wireless or wireline replacement devices and the incorporation of wireless “hot spot” technology in wireless devices making internet access seamless regardless of location.  Although less directly a substitute for other wireless services, wireless data services such as Wi-Fi may be adequate for those who do not need mobile wide-area roaming or full two-way voice services.  Technological advances or regulatory changes in the future, such as the rollout and consumer adoption of Wi-Fi calling and Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) capabilities, may make available other alternatives to current wireless service, thereby creating additional sources of competition that shift consumers’ perceptions and preferences of network strength, speed and reliability.  If the trend toward convergence continues, U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers, traditional cable companies, MVNOs and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence.  Cable companies have begun to compete in the wireless market.  Most notably, Comcast currently offers wireless services and Charter is expected to begin offering wireless services in 2018.

U.S. Cellular’s approach in 2018 and in future years will be to focus on the unique needs and attitudes of its customers towards wireless service.  U.S. Cellular will deliver high-quality services and products at competitive prices and intends to continue to differentiate itself by seeking to provide an overall outstanding customer experience, founded on a high-quality network.  U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changes related to new service offerings, consumer preferences, competitors’ pricing strategies and new product offerings, technology, demographic trends, economic conditions and its access to adequate spectrum resources.
 Network Technology, Roaming, and System Design
 Technology.  Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice, data, graphics and video through the transmission of signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC.  Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections.  A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, will remain an important factor for U.S. Cellular to remain competitive.
 4G LTE technology enables more network capacity for more data per user as well as faster access to data.  In addition, U.S. Cellular commercially deployed VoLTE technology for the first time in 2017 in one key market and will continue to build out VoLTE services over the next few years.  The next commercial launch is expected to occur in several additional operating markets starting in early 2018.  VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and enables enhanced services such as high definition voice, video calling and simultaneous voice and data sessions.  In addition, the deployment of VoLTE technology expands U.S. Cellular’s ability to offer roaming services to other carriers.  U.S. Cellular continues to offer services based on 3G technology and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital technology across its networks.
 Roaming.  U.S. Cellular’s main sources of revenues are its own customers and customers of other wireless operators who roam on its network.  An inter-carrier roaming agreement is negotiated between the wireless operators to enable customers who are in a wireless service area other than the customer’s home service area to place or receive a call or text message, or to use data services, in that service area.  U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal roaming agreements with operators of other wireless systems covering virtually all systems with CDMA technology in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  In addition, U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal 4G LTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, a majority of U.S. Cellular customers currently have access to nationwide 4G LTE service. 
Another digital technology, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), has a larger installed base of customers worldwide.  U.S. Cellular customers now have the ability to roam on GSM carriers with voice, data and text messaging in Canada, Mexico and internationally.  Both CDMA and GSM technologies are being succeeded by 4G LTE and VoLTE technology. 
System Design and Construction.  U.S. Cellular designs and constructs its systems in a manner it believes will permit it to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices.  Designs are based on engineering studies which relate to specific markets, in support of the larger network.  Network reliability is given careful consideration and extensive backup redundancy is employed in many aspects of U.S. Cellular’s network design.  Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topology and extensive use of emergency standby power also are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruption from any particular network element failure.
 In accordance with its strategy of building and strengthening its operating market areas, U.S. Cellular has selected high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office.  Centralized equipment, used for network and data management, is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy.  U.S. Cellular’s systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network.  Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology for nearly all 4G LTE sites, over fiber or microwave links.
 U.S. Cellular believes that currently available technologies and appropriate capital additions will allow sufficient capacity on its networks to meet anticipated demand for voice and data services over the next few years.  However, increasing demand for high-speed data may require the acquisition of additional spectrum licenses to provide sufficient capacity and throughput.
 Construction of wireless systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment for land and improvements, buildings, towers, mobile telephone switching offices, cell site equipment, transport equipment, engineering and installation.  U.S. Cellular primarily uses its own personnel to engineer each wireless system it owns and operates, and engages contractors to construct the facilities.
 The costs (inclusive of the costs to acquire licenses) to develop the systems which U.S. Cellular operates have historically been financed primarily through proceeds from debt offerings, with cash generated by operations, and proceeds from the sales of wireless interests and other non-strategic assets.

Business Development Strategy
 U.S. Cellular groups its individual markets (geographic service areas as defined by the FCC in which wireless carriers are licensed, for fixed terms, to provide service) into broader geographic market areas to offer customers large service areas that primarily utilize U.S. Cellular’s network.  U.S. Cellular’s interests in wireless licenses include both direct interests whereby U.S. Cellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating licenses covering 31 states and a total population of 51 million at December 31, 2017.
 U.S. Cellular’s business development strategy is to obtain interests in or access to wireless licenses in its current operating markets and in areas that are adjacent to or in close proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building larger geographic operating market areas.  U.S. Cellular believes that the acquisition of additional licenses within its current operating markets will enhance its network capacity and speed to meet its customers’ growing demand for data services.  From time to time, U.S. Cellular has divested outright or included in exchanges for other wireless interests certain consolidated and investment interests that were considered less essential to its current and expected future operations.  As part of its business development strategy, U.S. Cellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum.  See Note 6 — Acquisitions, Divestitures and Exchanges in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent significant acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges.
 Occasionally, the FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services.  Historically, U.S. Cellular has participated in certain prior FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests.  Each limited partnership that qualified as a “designated entity” was eligible for bidding credits with respect to most licenses purchased in accordance with the rules defined by the FCC for each auction.  In most cases, the bidding credits resulted in a 25% discount from the gross winning bid.  In July 2016, the FCC announced U.S. Cellular as a qualified bidder in the FCC’s forward auction of 600MHz spectrum licenses, referred to as Auction 1002.  Due to changes in FCC rules, U.S. Cellular did not apply to participate in Auction 1002 by investing in a “designated entity” limited partnership which would have qualified for a discount of 25% on any licenses won in the auction.  Instead, U.S. Cellular applied to participate in the auction directly and did not qualify for such discount.  The FCC announced by way of public notice that U.S. Cellular was the winning bidder for 188 licenses for an aggregate purchase price of $329 million and granted the licenses to U.S. Cellular during the second quarter of 2017.  See Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, under “Regulatory Matters – FCC Auction 1002” for a summary of U.S. Cellular’s participation in Auction 1002.

TDS TELECOM OPERATIONS
 General
 TDS Telecom operates in 34 states and through its Wireline and Cable operations provides broadband, video and voice services to approximately 1.2 million connections.  The overall strategy for the Wireline and Cable businesses is to offer a wide range of broadband services in order to capitalize on data growth and customers’ needs for higher broadband speeds and leverage that growth by bundling services with video and voice.  
HMS provides a comprehensive range of Information Technology (IT) services including colocation, cloud and hosting solutions, managed services, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application management, and sales of IT hardware and related maintenance and professional services.  As disclosed above, HMS will no longer be reported under TDS Telecom effective January 1, 2018.
Business Development Strategy
 TDS Telecom may seek to grow its operations through the acquisition of businesses that support and complement its existing services and products.  TDS Telecom may also seek to divest or exchange interests that are not strategic to its long-term success.  See Note 6 — Acquisitions, Divestitures and Exchanges in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges. 
Core Network
 TDS Telecom has developed and deployed an inter-regional data routing infrastructure using owned and leased fiber capacity which allows it to leverage its multi-gigabit core network across all three of its segments.  This configuration, along with the continued development of an Internet Protocol (IP) network that interconnects substantially all the existing service territories, allows for next generation IP service offerings: IP-based video, commercially hosted IP-voice (managedIP), residential Voice over IP (VoIP), least-cost routing, and comprehensive IP policy management.
 The TDS Telecom core network continues to standardize equipment and processes to increase efficiency in maintaining its network.  TDS Telecom utilizes centralized monitoring and management of its network to reduce costs and improve service reliability.  Network standardization has aided TDS Telecom in operating its 24-hours-a-day / 7-days-per-week Network Management Center, which continuously monitors the network in an effort to proactively identify and correct network faults prior to any customer impact.  
Wireline 
 Operations
 Wireline operations are located in a mix of rural, small town and suburban markets, with the largest concentrations of customers in the Upper Midwest and the Southeast.  As of December 31, 2017, TDS Telecom operates incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) in 25 states and provides telecommunications services as a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin.  Wireline operations provide retail telecommunications services to both residential and commercial customers.  Wireline also provides services to wholesale customers, which are primarily interexchange carriers (companies that provide long-distance telephone and data services between local exchange areas) and wireless carriers that compensate TDS Telecom for the use of its facilities to originate and terminate their voice and data transmissions.
Customers, Services and Products
 Wireline operations generate revenues by providing the following services and products to residential and commercial customers and carriers:
 
Broadband: Fiber technology is being deployed to select markets to provide Internet speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps).  In certain non-fiber markets, TDS Telecom has deployed copper bonding technology to increase data speeds reaching up to 100 Megabits per second (Mbps).  Premium security and support services are available to enhance the customers’ high-speed Internet experience.
Video: TDS TV is a comprehensive all-digital TV service available in select TDS markets that provides customers with connected-home digital video recorders (DVR), video-on-demand (VOD) , TV Everywhere (TVE) and other enhanced applications and features.  Where TDS TV is not available, TDS Telecom partners with a satellite TV provider to offer digital television.
Voice: Call plans include local and long-distance telephone service, VoIP and enhanced services like find me follow me, collaboration, instant messaging and more.  Many features are bundled with calling plans to give customers the best value.
Network access services are provided to interexchange and wireless carriers for transporting data and voice traffic on TDS Telecom’s network.

Wireline’s objective is to be a preferred broadband provider in its markets, focusing its investments on broadband as the core growth component of its service offerings.  Wireline believes that its residential and business customers have a strong preference to purchase complementary telecommunications services from a single provider.  Wireline has found that by offering and bundling services in high-value based packages with a strong customer service orientation, it can build customer loyalty and reduce customer churn.  The Wireline residential customer strategy is to provide broadband, video and voice services through value-added bundling of these services.  The commercial focus is to provide advanced IP-based data and voice services.
 Residential.  Wireline residential customer operations provide high-speed data services, video services and voice service.  In selected residential markets, Wireline’s marketing and promotional strategies focus on its Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service offering under the brand TDS TV.  This IP based video offering is intended to counter intensifying competition for video and broadband services.  In markets where IPTV is not offered, TDS Telecom has partnered with a satellite TV provider to allow for triple or double play bundling.  Approximately 79% of ILEC customers have at least two services.
 Commercial.  Wireline commercial customer operations provide broadband, IP-based services, and hosted voice and collaboration services to small to medium sized businesses.  Wireline operations provide commercial customers with secure and reliable Internet access, data connections and advanced voice service with VoIP features.  The Wireline flagship product is managedIP, a fully-hosted software and hardware solution that provides customers with a secure Internet connection and innovative collaboration features and capabilities.  TDS managedIP is available in markets covering 83% of all commercial customers at December 31, 2017.  TDS managedIP is also available to customers which have locations outside the traditional Wireline footprint by offering the service over the customer’s data network.
 Wholesale.  Wireline operations continue to provide a high level of service to traditional interexchange and wireless carriers.  Wireline’s wholesale market focus is on access revenues, which is the compensation received from the interexchange carriers for carrying data and voice traffic on TDS Telecom’s networks.  Federal Connect America Fund (CAF) and state Universal Service Fund (USF) revenues, which support the cost of providing telecommunication services in underserved high cost areas, are also included in wholesale service revenues.  Beginning in 2017, TDS receives over $75 million per year for 10 years (with incremental funding for transition in the early years for certain states) for operating and maintaining its network along with the obligation to provide broadband service at various speeds to about 160,000 locations.  Continuing regulatory changes may affect the amounts of future Wireline wholesale revenues.  See additional information in Risk Factors and information incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section “Regulatory Matters”.
 Access Technology and System Design
 Wireline operates an integrated, highly-reliable network that consists of central office host and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and IP switches.  Fiber optic and copper cable connect the host central offices with remote switches and ultimately with end customers.  Wireline continues to upgrade and expand its telecommunications network to respond to the needs of its customers for greater bandwidth and advanced technologies.  Broadband service is provided to 96% of Wireline’s ILEC service addresses.  The network is transitioning from its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to facilitate the integration of broadband, video and voice services.  
 Wireline pursues a plan to deploy fiber-to-the-home technology, which enables significantly greater broadband speeds to selected residential subdivisions and to commercial customers, when the investment is economically justified.  Fiber technology is deployed to provide internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps.  In addition, in non-fiber markets, data speeds are increased through the use of copper bonding and vectoring technology.  Approximately 45% of Wireline service addresses were capable of 25 Mbps or greater broadband speeds at the end of 2017.
Competition
 The competitive environment in the telecommunications industry has changed significantly as a result of technological advances, customer expectations, and changes to regulation.  Wireline continues to seek to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure to ensure that it can compete with price-based initiatives from competitors.  Wireline faces significant challenges, including competition from cable, low-cost voice providers, other wireline and wireless providers as well as decreases in compensation received for the use of TDS Telecom’s networks.  
 Wireline has experienced customer connection and access minute declines due to competition from wireless carriers offering local and nationwide voice and data plans, from cable providers offering voice and data services via cable modems, from fiber overbuilders, and from other low cost voice providers.
Cable companies have developed technological improvements that have allowed them to extend their competitive operations beyond major markets and have enabled them to provide a broader range of data and voice services over their cable networks.  Cable companies have aggressively pursued the bundling of data, video and voice products at discounted prices to attract customers from traditional telephone companies.  In addition, cable companies continue to add value to their Internet offerings by increasing speeds at little to no additional cost to the customer.  Wireline estimates that 79% of its ILEC service addresses face active competition from cable providers at December 31, 2017.  Cable companies are increasingly targeting commercial customers.

Wireless telephone service providers offering feature-rich wireless devices and improved network quality constitute a significant source of voice and broadband competition.  A growing segment of customers have chosen to completely forego the use of traditional wireline telephone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice communications services.  This trend is more pronounced among residential customers, which comprise approximately 65% of Wireline connections as of December 31, 2017.  Some small businesses have followed the residential path by choosing wireless service and disconnecting wireline voice service.  
 While TDS Telecom positions itself as a high-quality telecommunications provider, it is also experiencing competition from Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in areas where TDS Telecom competes as a CLEC.  The RBOCs are continuing to implement technological changes that could impede TDS Telecom’s access to facilities used to provide CLEC telecommunications services.  To mitigate this risk TDS Telecom has refocused the business on serving customers who do not require leased facilities.


Cable 
 Operations
 TDS Telecom’s Cable business was developed through multiple strategic acquisitions which operate primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, and Utah.  TDS Telecom’s cable business, a natural extension of the Wireline business, operates under two brand names: TDS and BendBroadband. 
 Through its Cable operations, TDS Telecom seeks to be the leading provider of broadband services in its targeted markets by leveraging its core competencies in network management and customer focus.  The Cable strategy is to expand its broadband services and leverage that growth by bundling with video and voice services.  Through investment in plant upgrades, and improvements in programming and customer service levels, TDS Telecom intends to strengthen its markets and continue to grow its revenue base.
Customers, Services and Products
 Residential.  Cable offers advanced broadband, video and voice services.  These services are actively bundled at competitive prices to encourage cross-selling within Cable’s customer base and to attract new customers.  Approximately 55% of residential customers subscribe to a bundle of services.

Broadband:  DOCSIS 3.0 technology is deployed to nearly all of Cable’s service addresses which allows it to offer enhanced transmission speeds.  TDS Telecom is offering 600 Mbps service in its largest markets.  Access to 24/7 technical support and security features is also provided to broadband customers.  Plans are under way to roll out DOCSIS 3.1 technology which will offer significantly higher speeds of up to 1 Gbps.  
Video: Customers have access to basic service, premium programming and high-definition television combined with DVR service.  Cable introduced “CatchTV,” a branded whole-home DVR solution.
Voice:  Telephony service uses IP to transport digitized voice signals over the same private network that brings cable television and broadband services to customers.  All residential voice service customers have access to direct international calling and can subscribe to various long distance plans.

 Commercial.  Business services are delivered over a robust network to provide broadband products, multi-line phone solutions and video.  Cable provides advanced business services, including data networking, Ethernet, broadband access and VoIP services, to small and medium sized businesses.  TDS Telecom has also extended its managedIP product line to its Cable operations.  
 Access Technology and System Design
 Cable’s telecommunication systems are designed to transmit broadband, video and voice services using a hybrid fiber-coaxial network that consists of optical fiber transport from a headend facility to nodes where coaxial cable is then used to reach residential and business customers.  In certain markets, Cable has an all-fiber network to the home or business.  These fiber-rich networks offer substantial bandwidth capacity and, through the use of DOCSIS 3.0 and next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology, enable Cable to offer robust broadband and voice services as well as traditional and two-way video services.  All Cable markets are connected to TDS Telecom’s core network.  This allows Cable to leverage existing internet connectivity, voice services, and support systems, which enhances reliability and redundancy and builds greater dependability as a service provider.

Competition
 Cable seeks to be the leading provider of broadband and video services in its targeted markets.  From a broadband perspective, Cable will compete against the incumbent local telephone providers, which primarily offer DSL-based services.  Cable offers a superior, higher bandwidth data product using its DOCSIS technology.  Video competition is primarily from satellite providers, and on a limited basis, telephone companies that offer video services and compete for broadband and voice customers.  Other telecommunications providers, including Internet-based VoIP providers and wireless providers may compete directly for both residential and commercial voice and broadband service customers.  Changes in consumer behavior or new technologies or both could cause consumers to reduce or cancel their cable video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies.  To remain competitive in the video business TDS Telecom is developing a next generation video platform called Cloud TV.  It will be offered in its Wireline and Cable operations.  The strategy of the Cable segment is focused on broadband to capitalize on the data needs of consumers.  Since cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises, competing cable systems may be built in the same area.  Cable intends to avoid markets served by such over-builders or municipalities which have constructed their own cable systems or where other ILECs provide fiber to the premise broadband and video service offerings.

 Competition
 The IT services market is large and complex, with a diverse array of segments in which performance and market dynamics vary considerably.  As a result of these dynamics, the IT services market is a highly competitive environment.  Market competitors include large technology and other companies that primarily target Fortune 500 sized companies as well as smaller independent companies that provide services for mid-sized business customers.  HMS’ strategy is to position itself not to compete head-to-head with these providers, but rather to fill the gap between large business process outsourcers and fragmented IT service providers.  However, new entrants may emerge and grow rapidly creating additional sources of competition.
TDS — REGULATION
 
TDS’ operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation.  Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.  Additional information relating to TDS’ regulatory environment is in Risk Factors and incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section “Regulatory Matters.”
 U.S. Cellular
 TDS provides various wireless services, including voice and data services, pursuant to licenses granted by the FCC.  The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act).  The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications.  However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
 Wireless licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC.  The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval.  The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless licenses is in the public interest.  Wireless licenses are granted generally for a ten year term or, in some cases, for a fifteen year term.  The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications.  All of U.S. Cellular’s licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed.  U.S. Cellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
 As part of its data services, U.S. Cellular provides internet access.  Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
 Reference is made to Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under “Regulatory Matters” for information regarding any significant recent developments and proposals relating to the foregoing regulatory matters.
 Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection.  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
 Wireline
 The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over all facilities of, and services offered by, TDS Telecom’s ILECs as telecommunications common carriers, to the extent they provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications.  State public utility commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications facilities and services.  In addition, the Wireline business is subject to various other state and local laws, including laws relating to privacy, data security and consumer protection.
 The Communications Act requires, among other things, that telecommunications common carriers offer interstate services when requested at just and reasonable rates at terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory.  Maximum rates for regulated interstate services are prescribed by the FCC.  In many states, local rates paid by end user customers and intrastate access charges paid by carriers continue to be subject to state commission approval.
 TDS Telecom’s CLEC operations are subject to similar but reduced regulation compared to ILECs.
 In addition to traditional circuit-switched voice service that is fully regulated as a telecommunications common carrier service, TDS Telecom also provides interconnected VoIP, which is currently subject to less regulation.
 TDS Telecom also offers broadband services, including internet access.  As described more fully in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under “Regulatory Matters – FCC Rulemaking – Restoring Internet Freedom,” there are developments and proposals that may result in changes in regulation of such services.
 
12

Cable
 As a cable multiple systems operator (MSO), Cable is subject to regulation by the FCC, covering matters such as technical operations, administrative requirements, consumer protection, access by people with disabilities, customer privacy and content.  The operation of cable systems requires the MSO to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to occupy public rights of way with network facilities.  These franchises typically are nonexclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations, and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a standard percentage of gross revenues.
 TDS’ Cable operations also provide interconnected VoIP and broadband services, including internet access.  The interconnected VoIP and internet regulatory matters and issues described above under “Wireline” are substantially similar for cable providers, including proposals that may result in changes in regulation of broadband internet services as described more fully in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under “Regulatory Matters – FCC Rulemaking – Restoring Internet Freedom.”
HMS
 HMS is subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.  Federal, state and local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement may be applicable and may differ significantly among those jurisdictions.  These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, copyrights and other intellectual property, electronic communications and regulations applicable to electronic products and services.
