 Lands’ End is a leading uni-channel retailer of casual clothing, accessories, footwear and home products. Operating out of America’s heartland, we believe our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customers. We offer products online at www.landsend.com, through our own Company Operated stores and through 
 2


third-party distribution channels. We are a classic American lifestyle brand with a passion for quality, legendary service and real value.  We seek to deliver timeless style for women, men, kids and the home.
 Lands’ End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder’s motto as one of our guiding principles: “Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself.”
 Lands’ End seeks to provide a common customer experience regardless of whether they are interacting with us on our company websites, at Company Operated stores or through third-party distribution channels.  
 We have one external reportable segment and identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Our operating segments consist of: U.S. eCommerce, Europe eCommerce, Japan eCommerce, Outfitters, Third Party, and Retail. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one external reportable segment.
 Distribution Channels
 Lands’ End identifies five separate distribution channels for revenue reporting purposes:
  
• | U.S. eCommerce offers products through our eCommerce website.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | International offers products primarily to consumers located in Europe and Japan through eCommerce international websites and third-party affiliates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Outfitters sells uniform and logo apparel to businesses and their employees, as well as to student households through school relationships, located primarily in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Third Party sells the same products as U.S. eCommerce direct to consumers through third-party marketplace websites and through domestic wholesale customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail sells products through Company Operated stores.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 In Fiscal 2021, we generated Net revenue of approximately $1.64 billion. Net revenue is generated worldwide with operations based in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. This network reinforces and supports sales across the distribution channels in which we do business. Net revenue is presented by distribution channel in the following table:

Strategy
 We continue to leverage our iconic American brand, which was founded on the principles of delivering great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. We are a vertically integrated retailer that manages most aspects of our design, marketing and distribution in-house. In Fiscal 2022, we plan to continue to focus on our five strategic pillars, as we have over the past several years:
 Product. The soul of the Lands’ End brand has always been products with a purpose. We focus on delivering key items made of quality materials, in iconic styles that offer great value to our customers and their families. We provide an assortment of products leveraging our key item strategy with a focus on delivering comfort, style and value with emphasis on major categories such as swim, outerwear and sleepwear. We will continue to lead with our Let’s Get Comfy® marketing, emphasizing comfort, versatility with one closet messaging and consistent quality of our fit. In addition, we continue our focus on inclusivity. We have done this by providing apparel to “fit every body” in extended sizes, with petite, tall and plus for women and big and tall for men. We work to drive consistency in our fit across multiple categories and classifications. In Fiscal 2022, we plan to continue to leverage customer data to drive decisions around our merchandise assortment, fabrics, silhouettes and price points. 
 Digital. We focus on utilizing digital technologies to obtain new customers and continuously improve the overall customer experience. This is done by leveraging data analytics to better tailor and personalize the shopping experience for each customer. We are a digitally-led organization, applying technology as we adapt to ongoing shifts in customer shopping behaviors. We leverage advanced data analytics and machine learning in our effort to optimize gross profit through product level promotions and to optimize both internal and external search capabilities. We strive to continually enhance our website with a “test and learn” approach. As part of our Fiscal 2022 initiatives, we plan to continue to leverage artificial intelligence to analyze customer behavior and optimize promotions.
 Distribution. We take a uni-channel distribution approach, utilizing eCommerce, our own Company Operated stores and third-party distribution channels to engage our customer where and how they choose to shop. Given the impact of the COVID pandemic on consumers’ shopping habits, which has driven more consumers to shop online rather than in a store, we do not anticipate opening more Company Operated stores in the immediate future. We do, however, plan to pursue opportunities to selectively partner with other retailers to increase exposure of our products to more consumers. In Fiscal 2020, we launched nearly all our products for purchase on Kohl’s website, as well as an assortment of products in 150 Kohl’s retail locations. During Third Quarter 2021, we expanded a broader store assortment into an additional 150 Kohl’s retail locations for a total of 300 retail locations. In Fiscal 2022, we plan to continue exploring opportunities to expand our reach through third-party distribution channels.
 4


Business Infrastructure and Processes. We continue to focus on building strategic competencies through improved business processes that are based on standardization and efficiency. During Fiscal 2021, we focused on upgrading the way we accept, process and fulfill orders across our distribution channels and improve how we interface with our partners. We are also upgrading our inventory planning process and data analytic capabilities to grow the business and operate as a global uni-channel retailer. We began a multi-year project during Fiscal 2021 to implement a warehouse management solution designed to improve our distribution operations. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Be a Great Place to Work.  Lands’ End strives to be a great place to work. We foster an inclusive culture where our employees can develop and grow professionally and contribute to our collective success. During Fiscal 2021, we built on our existing training and development programs and expanded many employee initiatives, including our Diversity & Inclusion Council and our Business Resource Groups.  In 2021, Forbes recognized Lands’ End as one of America’s Best Employers for Diversity and one of America’s Best Employers for Women.
History
 We were founded in 1963, incorporated in Delaware in 1986, and our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1986 to 2002. On June 17, 2002, we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sears Roebuck and Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sears Holdings. Sears Holdings distributed 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Lands’ End to its stockholders on April 4, 2014, and our common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
 Lands’ End was founded on certain principles of doing business that are embodied in our goal to deliver great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. 
 Competition
 We operate primarily in the apparel industry which is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, women’s and men’s specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. We compete principally on the basis of merchandise value (quality and price), product innovation, our established customer file and award-winning customer service.
Seasonality
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our yearly net revenue and earnings during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 33.9%, 37.7% and 37.9% of our yearly net revenue in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The Fiscal 2021 percentage decrease of net revenue in the fourth quarter was primarily attributed to the impact of the global supply chain challenges experienced throughout the economy. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue has had and could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, working capital requirements typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.
 Intellectual Property
 Lands’ End owns or has rights to use certain word and design trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are registered or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Lands’ End® trade name and trademark are used both in the United States and internationally and are material to our business. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Let’s Get Comfy®, Lands’ End Lighthouse®, Square Rigger™, Squall®, Super-T™, Drifter™, Outrigger®, Marinac®, and Beach Living®, all of 
 5


which are owned by us, as well as the licensed marks Supima®, No-Gape®, and others. Other recognized trademarks owned by Lands’ End includes Starfish™, Iron Knees®, Hyde Park®, Year’ Rounder®, ClassMate®, Willis & Geiger® and ThermaCheck®. Lands’ End’s rights to some of these trademarks are limited to select markets.
 Product Design and Merchandising
 We seek to develop new, innovative products for our customers by utilizing modern fabrics and quality construction to create timeless, affordable styles with excellent fit. We also seek to present our products in an engaging and inspiring way. We believe that our typical customers expect quality, seek good value for their money and are looking to add classics to their wardrobe while also placing an emphasis on comfort, functionality and product innovation that supports their lifestyle. From a design and merchandising perspective, we believe that we have experienced success adding relevant items into our product assortment, many of which have become customer favorites. We devote significant time and resources to quality assurance, fit testing and product compliance. Our in-house team manages all product specifications and seeks to ensure brand integrity by providing our customers with the consistent, high-quality merchandise for which Lands’ End is known. Our product strategy includes four major themes: own the weather; own the water; layers, layers, layers; and we fit every body. These, along with our overall message on comfort, fit and great value, have resonated well with our customers.
Inventory Planning
 Inventory Planning seeks to determine optimal inventory levels that align with merchandising and marketing plans and initiatives. The team also supports efforts to optimize product margin through active management of in-season promotions and post-season clearance activities. In addition, Inventory Planning partners with our Global Sourcing team through long range planning efforts designed to better manage supply chain costs.
 Consistent with our merchandising strategy, we make inventory investments intended to support the growth of key products. In addition, we strive to improve assortment efficiency to increase seasonal sell through. We continue to leverage technology solutions to assist us in these strategic initiatives.  
 Sourcing and Vendors
 Our products are produced globally by independent manufacturers who are selected, monitored and coordinated primarily by our Global Sourcing team based in Wisconsin and Hong Kong. In Fiscal 2021, the top five countries where our vendors are located accounted for approximately 75% of our merchandise purchases in dollars. Our products are manufactured in approximately 20 countries and the majority are imported from Asia and South America, depending on the nature of the product mix.  
 In Fiscal 2021, our top 10 vendors accounted for approximately 47% of our merchandise purchases in dollars and we worked with approximately 112 vendors that manufactured substantially all our products. We generally do not enter into long-term merchandise supply contracts. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to more efficiently source our products worldwide, consistent with our high standards of quality and value. Significant areas of non-product spend include transportation, information systems, marketing, packaging and catalog paper and print. For most of our products, we assume ownership at the port of the vendor’s manufacturing facility. We use third-party shipping companies to transport the product to our facilities. Our reliance on imported products has certain risks around disruptions in countries of manufacture, port congestion, transportation delays and heightened security measures that have affected, and could in the future affect, timely deliveries of product to our points of distribution. During the second half of Fiscal 2021, we experienced significant delays due to global supply chain challenges and have experienced higher transportation costs. We expect these delays from global supply chain challenges and the increases in transportation costs to continue throughout Fiscal 2022. 
 It is important to us that our partners share the same core values as we do. Therefore, we require that all vendors comply with applicable legal requirements, agree to our global compliance requirements and meet our product quality standards. Our vendors are required to provide us with full access to their facilities and to relevant 
 6


records relating to their employment practices, such as, but not limited to, child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions and other business practices so that we may monitor their compliance with ethical and legal requirements relating to the conduct of their business. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Corporate Citizenship
 Lands’ End is working towards improving its sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, purchasing recycled consumables and corporate partnerships. Lands’ End hopes to inspire customers and other corporations to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives.
 We have a focus on raising awareness and educating associates on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our corporate office and distribution centers. For example, we have addressed our use and recycling of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic, as well as disposal of non-recyclables with composting and effective water management.
 Lands’ End has formed strategic relationships with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and National Forest Foundation, where we have helped plant over 1 million trees. With the Clean Lakes Alliance, we help with education and protecting and improving the quality of local parks and lakes in Wisconsin. 
 Marketing
 We believe that our most important asset is our brand. Lands’ End is well-recognized and has a deeply rooted tradition of excellent quality, value and service. Lands’ End is an iconic American brand with a large and loyal customer base. Operating out of Wisconsin, in the heartland of the United States, we believe our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customer as evidenced by the growth of our new and active customer files. 
 We also invest significantly in brand development through our focus on providing excellent customer service, emphasis on digital transformation and innovative product development. We believe that this commitment to our brand has helped to generate our large and loyal customer base for over fifty years. We are also seeking to enhance our branding initiatives by investing in strategic relationships with other brands, public personalities and online influencers designed to showcase our apparel.
 We attempt to build on our brand recognition through our “Let’s Get Comfy” tagline in multi-channel marketing campaigns including through our eCommerce website, www.landsend.com, catalog distribution, digital marketing and social media. Creative designs for these marketing platforms are developed in-house by our creative team with supplemental work by external agencies on a project basis. We strive to be efficient in our overall spend, enabling us to invest in initiatives that we believe will yield benefits over the longer term. We believe we will generate near-term return on investment with most of our marketing spend allocated to digital marketing and our catalog. The catalog continues to be a productive vehicle to drive customers to our website and Company Operated stores. 
 Customer Service
 We are committed to building on Lands’ End’s legacy of strong customer service. We believe we have a strong track record of improving the customer service experience through innovation. Lands’ End is focused on using our extensive customer data to make the shopping experience as effortless and personalized as possible, regardless of whether our customers shop online or in one of our Company Operated stores. Our operations include customer service agents who are available on the phone, via chat, email or social media, and an ever-evolving digital self-service platform as well as through Company Operated store locations. These all have contributed to our award-winning customer service, which we believe is one of our core strengths and a key point of differentiation from our competitors.

We have received many accolades over the years and most recently, received the following:
  
• | Lands’ End was included in the Newsweek list of America’s Best Customer Service in 2021, 2020, and 2019, ranking No.1 for 2021 and 2019 for best customer service in the Online Retailers: Clothing in the Apparel category

Distribution
 We own and operate three distribution centers in Wisconsin. Our Dodgeville facility is approximately 1.1 million square feet, our Reedsburg facility is approximately 400,000 square feet and our Stevens Point facility is approximately 150,000 square feet. Our customer orders are shipped via third-party carriers.
 We own and operate a distribution center in the United Kingdom based in Oakham, a community north of London. Our Oakham facility opened in 1998 and is approximately 175,000 square feet. In September 2020, this facility was granted customs warehouse authorization from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which provides certain cash flow benefits resulting from deferred customs duties and simplification of imports into the European Union. 
 Additionally, we lease a 56,000 square foot distribution center in Fujieda, Japan.
 Information Technology
 Our information technology systems provide comprehensive support for the design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, distribution and sales of our Lands’ End products. We have a dedicated information technology team that provides strategic direction, application development, infrastructure services and systems support for the functions and processes of our business. The information technology team contracts with third-party consulting firms to provide cost-effective staff augmentation services and leverages leading hardware, software and cloud-based technology firms to provide the infrastructure necessary to run and operate our systems. Our core software applications are a combination of internally developed and third-party systems. The eCommerce solutions powering www.landsend.com, the Outfitters websites, and our international Lands’ End websites are operated out of our own internal data centers, as well as through hosting relationships with third parties and industry-leading cloud providers.
 We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems as part of a multi-year plan to expand and upgrade our platforms and infrastructure. We intend to build off these core systems to drive future improvements in our operations including efficiencies within our infrastructure, processes and reporting. While we focus on customer facing system improvements, we are also implementing warehouse management tools designed to improve operational efficiencies and optimize our distribution operations. In support of our business strategies, we are implementing new solutions to enable and streamline the process in which we offer, sell and fulfill our products with wholesale partners and external marketplaces. Implementation of new systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware, cloud and system integration providers. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Human Capital Management
 Philosophy and Approach

 Since our founding in 1963, Lands’ End has recognized that our people are a critical asset. People, the individuals we employ, the customers we serve, and their families, are the heart of our company. We are committed to creating an inspiring culture that is welcoming, safe and inclusive for all who work and shop with us.
 Aligning with our overall message of comfort, our desire is to create “A More Comfortable World” with initiatives focused on our employees, our customers and our planet. Perhaps most telling, at Lands’ End the human resources department has been named “Employee Services” since its early days. This reinforces the message of our founder, Gary Comer “The really important thing that makes Lands’ End what it has become is people. You, me, everyone around us. It is what we do as people that makes this a great place to come to work”.
 8


We employ approximately 5,000 employees: approximately 4,0 employees in the United States and approximately ,000 employees outside the United States. This workforce consists of approximately 20% salaried employees, 40% hourly employees and 4% part-time employees. With the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter holiday shopping season in the retail industry, approximately ,500 additional, flexible, part-time employees are hired to support our call and distribution centers. 
 Recruitment and Retention 
 Lands’ End leverages a multipronged recruitment approach to source and hire top talent aligned with our corporate priorities. We maintain a strong digital presence to represent our brand and proactively target talent, in addition to a meaningful employee referral bonus program. We have annual talent reviews to evaluate and align on high potential talent with development actions that prepare employees for internal promotion and career growth opportunities, including succession planning for management positions. 
 Lands’ End has an open-door philosophy. We regularly conduct anonymous employee opinion surveys to seek feedback from all employment classifications on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and feedback on how we could improve our efforts to be an even greater place to work. Most recently, we conducted a global employee opinion survey in August 2021 and received both a high response rate and positive results. Survey outcomes are shared company wide, along with actions to drive meaningful improvements. Our efforts to retain talent and maintain strong employee engagement have been very effective, as evidenced by 42% of our employee base having a tenure of 10 years or more.  
 Turnover within our workforce is closely monitored to alert management of potential issues aside from our normal and desired turnover. Our three year average global salaried turnover rate is approximately 11.0%, and the turnover rate for our U.S. hourly full-time staff is approximately 10.5%. We maintain a strong focus on employee retention through regular and consistent communication, periodic pulse surveys and continued emphasis on employee personal health and safety.
 Impact of the COVID Pandemic
 The COVID pandemic has had a profound impact on our employees. Since the start of the COVID pandemic in March 2020, our distribution center has been fully operational on-site while our corporate staff has operated primarily in a remote work environment. This has driven innovations in the way tasks are accomplished and work gets done and has required an increased reliance on technology, in the form of teleconferencing. Management has continued to place emphasis on communication and cross-functional collaboration to compensate for the loss of informal day-to-day interaction in the office setting.
 We have utilized a task force composed of a cross-functional group of senior management to assess the work from home impact. This task force monitors relevant factors and has solicited input on work models for the future. In January 2022, Lands’ End began operating in a hybrid model that combines work from home with work from office, as opposed to the traditional “five days a week in the office” model. We believe offering a combination of hybrid and remote work models will allow us to meet evolving employee and candidate expectations, and we continue to monitor employee engagement and productivity as we assess the overall work model moving forward.
 We monitor employee satisfaction and are continuing to evolve our workplace practices to foster employee development, engagement and communication. Our culture remains an important part of who we are, and we remain focused on the overall business and financial performance that best suits the Company, our stockholders and our customer needs. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 As we strive to be a great place to work, we continue to focus on key initiatives to educate and support diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We believe our strength in work and life comes from the combination of 
 9


our unique experiences, backgrounds, and talents. We were recognized by Forbes in 2021 as one of America’s Best Employers for Diversity and one of America’s Best Employers for Women.
We maintain a Diversity and Inclusion Council (“D&I Council”) consisting of employees who come from diverse backgrounds, with Lands’ End’s Chief Executive Officer serving as the executive sponsor. The D&I Council oversees programming designed to celebrate diversity and foster awareness of all perspectives. To that end, the D&I Council maintains training modules, which are required of all employees, and hosts relevant speakers throughout the year to further employee education. The D&I Council maintains a prominent online presence within the Company’s intranet through which it communicates with all employees across a wide range of subjects, including the recognition of important days with various cultures and educational materials in support of building greater awareness and appreciation of our individual stories, experiences and lives. Each month, a Diversity Newsletter is sent company wide, which serves to further celebrate differences among us.
 We maintain Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) to provide support for our employees. The BRGs are employee-led and consist of individuals with common interests, backgrounds or demographic factors such as gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or life experience. We currently have six groups: Lands’ End PRIDE (LGTBQ+), Lands’ End Working Parents, LEEDA (Lands’ End Employees with Disabilities and Allies), Lands’ End Veterans, Lands’ End Multicultural, and Lands’ End UpLift (multi-generation). The groups are open to all employees, including allies who want to be supportive and involved. It is our belief that by encouraging and supporting BRGs, we are reinforcing our message of inclusion and hope to further empower our employees to utilize their voice to make Lands’ End welcoming, understanding and stronger. 
 The Employee Services team continually evolves our benefit offerings to provide more inclusive options. We extended our paid parental leave in 2022 to be more inclusive and expanded domestic partner benefits. We have also enhanced our recruitment process to support more diverse and inclusive hiring practices. Our strategies extend our reach by targeting areas of the country and industry groups that have top diverse talent and align with diverse business organizations that are reflective of our overall brand strategy. In addition, we are committed to recruitment that is free from bias and actively educate our interview panels and monitor to identify areas of improvement. 
 Compensation and Benefits
