ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DLH Holdings Corp. (“DLH” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “us” and “our”) is a full-service provider of professional healthcare and social services to government agencies including the Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA"), Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), Department of Defense ("DoD"), and other government agencies. Incorporated in New Jersey in 1969, the Company primarily contracts with its government customers through its subsidiaries.
DLH manages its operations from its principal executive offices at 3565 Piedmont Road NE, Building 3 Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia 30305. The Company also maintains a national capital region office in Silver Spring, Maryland.
The Company employs over 1,500 skilled employees working in more than 30 locations throughout the United States. 
Our business offerings are focused on three primary sources of revenue within the Federal services market space, as follows:

• | Department of Defense and veteran health services, comprising approximately 65% of our current business base;


• | Human services and solutions, comprising approximately 31% of our current business base; and


• | Public health and life sciences, comprising approximately 4% of our current business base.

Defense and veterans’ health solutions: DLH provides a wide range of healthcare services and delivery solutions to the Department of Veteran Affairs, US Army Medical Materiel Command and its subordinate US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Defense Health Agency and Army Medical Command. We believe that our DLH-developed tools and processes, including e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, along with our cloud-based case management system have been major contributors in differentiating the Company within this Federal market sector.
DLH provides a range of case management, physical and behavioral health examinations and associated medical administration services to enhance the assessment and transition process for military personnel readiness commands and individual service members. Advancing the technology readiness level of new developments and modifications is a critical priority of our federal agency customers. Our project managers and biomedical engineers perform state-of-the-art research and development, testing and evaluation, and development of new medical systems and devices intended to enhance the medical readiness of troops in combat theaters across the globe. Our medical logistics support assists the uniformed services plan for fielding these new systems and devices. We deliver clinical drug and alcohol counseling services to Navy installations worldwide as part of the clinical preceptorship program, thereby improving the sailor health and readiness.

DLH is on the forefront of ensuring that veterans receive their out-patient prescriptions on time, each day, through the VA CMOP pharmacy program which has been recognized for service excellence, citing the JD Powers evaluation of mail order pharmacy for each of the past eight years. We believe that our operational efficiency and expertise is well-aligned with the VA strategic goals to manage and improve operations and to deliver seamless and integrated support. Our unique capabilities and solutions help the VA optimize efficiency and help ensure program accountability as well as better service. 
DLH is also engaged in efforts to alleviate homelessness among veterans. We provide a range of professional case management services to support veterans' transition back into the community. These services include mental health evaluations, behavioral readiness, skills assessment, career counseling, and job preparation services.
Human services and solutions: DLH provides a wide range of human services and solutions to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Head Start and the Department of Homeland Security. DLH provides a systems-based approach toward assuring that underserved children and youth throughout the country are getting proper educational and environmental support, including health, nutritional, parental, and behavioral services during their formative years. Performance verification of grantors delivering such services nationwide is conducted using an evolving system of monitoring, evaluation, tracking and reporting tools against selected key performance indicators relative to school readiness. Large scale federally-funded, regionally managed, and locally delivered services require innovative monitoring and protocol systems integration to ensure productive and cost-effective results, which we deliver. Finally, DLH provides the enterprise-level IT system architecture design, migration plan, and ongoing maintenance (including call center) to manage the implementation using experienced subject matter experts and project management resources.
Public health and life sciences: DLH provides a wide range of services to Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture. DLH services include advancing disease prevention methods and health promotion to underserved and at-risk communities through development of strategic communication campaigns, research on emerging trends, health informatics analyses, and application of best practices including mobile, social, and interactive media. The Company leverages evidence-based methods and web technology to drive health equity to our most vulnerable populations through public engagement. For at-risk wildlife, DLH conducts biological research and surveys covering waterways in key parts of the country to protect and conserve aquatic populations as well as manage wetlands and habitats through environmental assessments. Projects often involve highly specialized expertise and research methodologies. This work is often very seasonal with regard to resources and funding.
Customers and Contract Mix
At present, the Company derives 100% of its revenue from agencies of the Federal government, primarily as a prime contractor but also as a subcontractor to other Federal prime contractors. Our current contracts are within the following markets: Defense/VA (65%), Human Services and Solutions (31%) and Public Health/Life Sciences (4%); of which 95% of these contracts have been awarded on a Time and Materials basis, 3% are Cost plus Fixed Fee contracts and 2% are Firm Fixed Price contracts. In addition, substantially all accounts receivable, including unbilled accounts receivable, are from agencies of the U.S. Government as of September 30, 2018 and 2017. We believe that the credit risk associated with our receivables is limited due to the creditworthiness of these customers. The Company’s current business base is 99% prime contracts and 1% subcontracts. 
Our largest customer continues to be the VA, which comprised approximately 63% and 62% of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. HHS which comprised approximately 34% and 34% of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is also a major customer. These agreements are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. While there can be no assurance as to the actual amount of services that the Company will ultimately provide to VA and HHS under its current contracts, we believe that our strong working relationships and our effective service delivery support ongoing performance for the terms of the contracts. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to continue our relationship with either of these customers, if we were to lose any of our material current contracts, or if the amount of services we provide to them was materially reduced.
DLH’s revenues from the VA are derived from 16 separate contracts related to its performance of pharmacy and logistics services in support of the VA’s consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy program. Approximately 57% of the Company’s current business base with the VA is derived from nine contracts (for pharmacy services) that are currently operating under extensions through April 2019 pending completion of the procurement process for a new contract. A single renewal request for proposal (“RFP”) has currently been issued for these nine contracts and we expect further extensions until the procurement process is completed. The RFP, however, requires the prime contractor be a service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB), which precludes the Company from bidding on the RFP as a prime contractor. We have joined an SDVOSB team as a subcontractor to respond to this RFP. Should the contract be awarded to an SDVOSB partner of DLH, the Company expects to 
4

continue to perform a significant amount of the contract’s volume of business. See “MD&A -- Potential Impact of Federal Contractual set-aside Laws and Regulations” for further discussion of the pending procurement of these contracts. The remaining seven contracts for logistics services to the VA are performed under contracts which do not expire until May 2019, and the Company believes that these contracts will be similarly extended during the procurement process. These contracts may be subject to the same requirement of awarding to a SDVOSB prime contractor.
Our contract with HHS in support of its Head Start program generated 31% and 29% of our revenue from HHS for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This contract is on a time and materials basis and consists of a base period of four option periods for a total term of five years through April 2020. The Company's Danya subsidiary has provided these similar services to HHS since 1999. Danya was acquired by the Company in May 2016.
Backlog
At September 30, 2018, our total backlog was approximately $172 million. Total backlog as of September 30, 2017 was approximately $167 million. Backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly multi-year government contracts and will vary depending upon the timing of new/renewal contract awards. Backlog is based upon customer commitments that the Company believes to be firm over the remaining performance period of our contracts. While no assurances can be given that existing contracts will result in earned revenue in any future period, or at all, the Company’s major customers have historically exercised their contractual renewal options.
Backlog value is quantified from management's judgment and assumptions about the volume of services based on past volume trends and current planning developed with customers. Our backlog may consist of both funded and unfunded amounts under existing contracts including option periods. At September 30, 2018, our funded backlog was approximately $60 million and our unfunded backlog was $112 million. 
The value of multi-client, competitive Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") contract awards is included in backlog computation only when a task order is awarded. The award of an IDIQ contract does not represent a firm order for services and is subject to competitive bidding. Generally, under an IDIQ contract, the government is not obligated to order a minimum of services or supplies from its contractor, irrespective of the total estimated contract value. 
Position and Distribution of Services and Solutions in Our Markets
The markets in which we compete and the manner in which we are positioned within them, are characterized by a number of features including, but not limited to: 

• | high barriers for entry into the selected markets in which we serve, resulting from customer requirements including past performance and subject matter expertise;


• | specialized credentials and licenses held by a substantial component of our employee base;


• | prime contractor position in contracts representing 99% of our revenue;


• | strong past performance record, as evidenced by our VA customer scoring the highest in overall satisfaction in the J.D. Power National Pharmacy Study over the past eight years; and


• | targeted expansion in critical national priority markets with Federal budget stability.

The Company operates primarily through prime contracts awarded by the government through competitive bidding processes. The Company has a diverse mix of contract vehicles with various agencies of the United States Government, which supports our overall corporate growth strategy. The majority of our contracts are time and materials type contracts. The Company has developed and continues to leverage a suite of solution offerings in a Lean Six Sigma environment, geared toward enhancing performance and productivity while reducing costs to its US government clients. We also provide services under IDIQ and government wide acquisition contracts, such as General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. The Company currently holds multiple GSA schedule contracts, under which we provide services that constitute a significant percentage of our total revenue. These Federal contract schedules are renewed on a recurring basis for a multi-year period.
We continue to invest in measures that drive excellence in our support to current clients and create differentiation as we compete in this space. We have invested in talent development initiatives, to include industry-leading learning management and applicant tracking systems. These will further enhance our highly qualified employee base and augment our efforts to infuse top 
5

talent into our operations through world-class recruiting and talent management tools. Building upon our lean six sigma and ISO 9001 credentials, we have invested further in agile software development credentials for our technical staff and have recently achieved Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level 3. We believe that these qualifications will further enhance our value propositions for current programs, as well as future business we pursue. In addition, we continue to build upon our heritage of excellent customer satisfaction in healthcare staffing services and have recently achieved Joint Commission certification for the safety and quality of our healthcare services delivery against national standards. These nationally recognized best practices certifications demonstrate our commitment to continuous improvement and performance excellence that is critical to our organic growth objectives.
Competitive Landscape
Competitive solicitations and long business development cycles are characteristics of the government and defense industry in which we operate. For major program competition, the business acquisition cycle typically ranges from 18 to 36 months. Companies may pursue work either as prime contractor or partner with other companies in a subcontractor role. Those competing as prime contractors normally expend substantially more resources than those in subcontractor roles. We partner and compete with several large and small-business companies in pursuit of acquiring new business.
Our competitor and comparable companies include operating units within, among others: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., CACI International, Inc., ICF International, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., Mantech International Corp., MAXIMUS, Inc., RTI, UnitedHealth Group, Inc., VSE Corporation and Westat, Inc.
DLH competes with these companies by leveraging our differentiating suite of tools and uniquely integrating people and processes resulting in highly competitive proposals and a solid track record of past performance. We compete for awards through a full and open competition on a "best-value basis". The Company draws heavily from its consistently high quality past performance ratings, proven and evolving technical differentiators, key personnel credentials and growing market recognition to compete. The Company believes that its track record, knowledge and processes with respect to government contract bidding processes represent significant competitive advantages. Our recent and future success in this competitive landscape hinges on our ability to continue to uniquely integrate people, processes and technology tools to deliver best value solutions for our targeted clients (both government and industry partners).
Additionally, the Federal government may elect to restrict certain procurements, including for renewals of our current contracts, to bidders that qualify for certain special statuses such as veteran owned, small, or small disadvantaged businesses. For those procurements, we would be limited to a subcontractor role.
Intellectual Property
Because our business involves providing services to government entities, our operations generally are not substantially dependent upon obtaining and/or maintaining copyright or trademark protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. We claim copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. DLH holds two registered trademarks, e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, that optimize resource allocation and supply chain management processes in connection with our business process management services. We maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets adequate protection to ensure their continuing availability.
Government Regulation
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. In addition, many federal and state laws materially affect the Company's operations. These laws relate to ethics, labor, tax, and employment matters. As is any employer, DLH is subject to federal and state statutes and regulations governing their standards of business conduct with the government. The development of additional statutes and regulations and interpretation of existing statutes and regulations with respect to our industry can be expected to evolve over time. Through its corporate membership with the Professional Services Council and other affiliations, DLH monitors proposed and pending regulations from relevant congressional committees and government agency policies that have potential impact upon our industry and our specific strategically targeted markets. As with any commercial enterprise, DLH cannot predict with certainty the nature or direction of the development of Federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Employee Relations
As of September 30, 2018, the Company employed over 1,500 employees performing in over 30 locations throughout the U.S. Management believes that is has good relations with its employees. In October 2014, employees at our Chicago location approved the adoption of union representation for non-management employees. Union representation has been certified for these employees and collective bargaining discussions are ongoing. Management does not expect this agreement to materially impact results of operations.
