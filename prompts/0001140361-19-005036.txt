--------+----------

   Introduction
    We are a blank check company incorporated on January 24, 2018 as a Delaware corporation. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We are currently in the process of trying to identify suitable targets for our Business Combination. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, we have primarily been focusing our search to date on acquiring a Business Combination candidate with a real estate component (such as a business within the hospitality, lodging, gaming, real estate or property services, or asset management industries). We have neither engaged in any operations unrelated to our search for Business Combination candidates nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
    On May 17, 2018, we closed our Initial Public Offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 34,500,000 Units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 4,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Class A common stock” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units publicly offered, the “public shares”) and one redeemable warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000.
    Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we issued to our Sponsor 12,350,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”), each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, in a private placement (“private placement”), generating gross proceeds of $12,350,000.
    Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, on January 26, 2018, the Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 shares (the “founder shares”) of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Class B common stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000.
    Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and private placement, $351,900,000 ($10.20 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and at UBS Financial Services Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The proceeds held in the Trust Account were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
    As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $651,000 in our operating bank account, approximately $3,733,000 of interest available to pay for franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) and working capital of approximately $532,000. As of December 31, 2018, an aggregate of approximately $801,000 had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes.
     
 Effecting our initial Business Combination
    General
    We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any meaningful operations unless and until we can complete our Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be in its early stages of development or growth or that has significant financial or liquidity needs, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
    If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
    Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial Business Combination
    We may pursue an initial Business Combination candidate in any industry or sector, however, given the experience of our founders, to date we have primarily been focusing on acquiring a Business Combination candidate with a real estate component (such as a business within the hospitality, lodging, gaming, real estate or property services, or asset management industries).
    Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
    We may, at our option, pursue an initial Business Combination opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors or an entity affiliated with any of our officers or directors, including Trinity Investments, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and our Sponsor considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co- investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our Trust Account to fund the Business Combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the Business Combination. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our Business Combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the Business Combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities or by such parties providing debt financing. We refer to the potential future issuance of equity or equity linked securities to any such party, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance.” The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of our Initial Public Offering plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B common stock at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions which are part of the agreement for our Business Combination; (ii) negotiation with Class A stockholders on structuring a Business Combination; (iii) negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B common stock; or (iv) as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock.

 We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete an initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions.
    The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.  It is possible that we may need to seek additional financing from our Sponsor, management team or other sources in order to complete our initial Business Combination, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such additional financing.
    We are not prohibited from pursuing a Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our officers or directors (our “initial stockholders”) or with a business affiliated with Trinity Investments. In the event we seek to complete our Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with any such parties, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
    Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial Business Combination
    We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination.
    3
 
 Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
    If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
    Submission of our initial Business Combination to a stockholder vote
    In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Business Combination.
    If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering, in favor of our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination.
    If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Business Combination. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they may not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”.) We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will need to comply with such rules.
    The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement might otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange and may reduce the liquidity of such securities.

 Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our initial Business Combination if we seek stockholder approval
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial public offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination.
    Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no Business Combination
    Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have 18 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or until November 17, 2019, to complete our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within such 18-month period, unless we seek an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend such 18 month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within the 18-month time period.
    If we seek a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, we are required to redeem any public shares properly submitted in connection with such stockholder vote.
 
Competition
    In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for an initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully executing an initial Business Combination.
Employees
    We currently have four officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters. We do not have any other employees.
