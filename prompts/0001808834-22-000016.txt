ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to PROG Holdings, Inc. ("PROG Holdings") and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
PROG Holdings is a financial technology holding company that provides leading financial solutions to empower consumers and retailers. PROG Holdings' operating segments include Progressive Leasing, an e-commerce, app-based, and in-store point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider, Vive Financial ("Vive"), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products, and Four Technologies, Inc. ("Four"), which offers Buy Now, Pay Later payment options to consumers through the Four platform. The Progressive Leasing segment comprised approximately 98% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Progressive Leasing provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions for merchandise, including furniture, appliances, electronics, jewelry, mobile phones and accessories, mattresses, and automobile electronics and accessories from leading traditional and e-commerce retailers (whom we refer to as our point-of-sale partners, "POS partners," or "retail partners"). Many of our customers fall within the near-prime or subprime Fair Isaac and Company ("FICO") score categories and may have difficulty purchasing big-ticket and other durable goods. Progressive Leasing's technology-based, proprietary decisioning platform offers prompt lease decisioning at the point-of-sale and is integrated with both traditional and e-commerce POS partners’ systems. Progressive Leasing provides customers with transparent and competitive lease payment options along with flexible terms that are designed to help customers achieve merchandise ownership, including through low initial payments and early buyout options. Lease-to-own transactions facilitated through our Company also benefit our POS partners by generating incremental sales to credit-challenged consumers, who typically would not have qualified for financing offers traditionally provided by these retailers. Progressive Leasing has funded over 10 million leases since its inception in 1999.
Strategy
Our strategy to drive growth in our business, which we believe positions us for success over the long-term, includes the following:
•Grow gross merchandise volume ("GMV") with existing and new POS partners - We plan to grow GMV through strategic collaboration and marketing efforts with our POS partners. We remain focused on converting our existing pipeline of retailers into new POS partners. Our ability to maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships, including addressing the changing needs of our POS partners, is critical to the long-term growth of our business. 
•Invest in technology that simplifies and improves the customer experience - We are investing in technology platforms that promote customer engagement and simplify the lease application, origination and servicing experience. We are committed to providing our customers with greater choice and flexibility in how and where they choose to shop. We are expanding and innovating our e-commerce capabilities to benefit existing and new POS partners and customers.
•Leverage our large database to drive repeat business - We are leveraging our extensive database of lease agreements to offer current and previous customers products and solutions that meet their needs. We also use historical information from that database to help inform our decisioning on the applications of potential new customers.
•Broaden our financial technology product ecosystem through research and development ("R&D") efforts and strategic acquisitions - We plan to expand our product solutions to create a more loyal and engaged customer base. 
•Employ direct-to-consumer marketing to drive shoppers in-store and online - We plan to continue expanding our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts to attract new customers and drive more GMV through our POS partners.
Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has three operating segments: Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four. The Company’s two reportable segments are Progressive Leasing and Vive, which is consistent with the current organizational structure and how the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews results to analyze performance and allocate resources. 
The operating results of our two reportable segments may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Progressive Leasing
Progressive Leasing is our largest operating segment, which empowers consumers and businesses with transparent and flexible lease-to-own options to help consumers achieve ownership of durable goods. Progressive Leasing provides e-commerce, app-based, and in-store point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions through approximately 24,000 third-party POS partner locations and e-commerce websites in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It does so by purchasing the desired merchandise from POS partners and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing consequently has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers. The Progressive Leasing segment comprised approximately 98% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Vive
Vive primarily serves customers who may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers and desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of over 5,000 POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, fitness equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers. The Vive segment comprised approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Four
Four provides consumers of all credit backgrounds with Buy Now, Pay Later ("BNPL") options through four interest-free installments. Four's proprietary platform capabilities provide our base of customers and POS partners with another payment solution as part of the PROG Holdings financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four's platform to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four was not a reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 as its revenues, loss before income taxes, and assets were not material to the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Four's financial results are reported within "Other" for segment reporting purposes.
Operations
Operating Strategy
Our operating strategy is based on distinguishing our Progressive Leasing, Vive, and Four brands from those of our competitors, along with maximizing our operational efficiencies. At every interaction with our POS partners and customers, our focus is on providing excellent service supported by the continued development and enhancement of technology-based solutions, enabling fast, simple self-service options. We believe this strategy allows us to grow incremental sales for our POS partners, while realizing operating efficiencies at scale. Importantly, our ability to service our POS partners and our customers while effectively managing labor costs allows us to offer lease-purchase solutions that are generally lower cost and otherwise more attractive than many other options available in the market. 

Legacy finance solution shortfall | Progressive Leasing’s answer 
Approximately 40% of United States population has a near or below prime FICO score and does not have a convenient solution to finance the purchase of big-ticket items. | Progressive Leasing offers a technology-based, proprietary decisioning platform with transparent and competitive lease payment options. 
Consumers are unable to qualify for traditional products due to low credit score or no traditional credit file/score. | Approvals are determined by factors beyond credit scores. 
Traditional products have high denial rates for non-prime customers and retailer staff have minimal training or program support to enable the purchase. | Progressive Leasing brand loyalty and marketing efforts help drive incremental business to our POS partners and support sales to customers that are otherwise unable to purchase.

Lease Agreement Customer Experience
We offer simplified and transparent lease application and payment processes:
Lease Agreement Decisioning Process 
Progressive Leasing uses proprietary decisioning algorithms to determine which applicants meet our leasing qualifications and the lease amount for which customers are approved. The decisioning data set contains over 5 million leases with mature lease performance data and other information provided from third party sources. Progressive Leasing's proprietary algorithms utilize the customer application, customer history, known fraud attributes, retailer/vertical performance and other information in the decision-making process. In 2021, 97% of lease decisions were completely automated, with a median decision time of 5.7 seconds.
Lease Agreement and Collection
The Progressive Leasing customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 months, by making weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to Progressive Leasing. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then acquires ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by making the contractually specified payment. 
Contractual payments are usually based on a customer's pay frequency and are typically processed through automated clearing house payments. If a payment is not made in a timely manner, collections are managed in-house through our call centers and proprietary lease management system. The call center contacts customers within a few days after the due date to encourage 
them to keep their agreement current. If the customer chooses to return the merchandise, arrangements are made to receive the merchandise from the customer by either scheduling a pick-up or shipping the merchandise to our warehouse in Draper, Utah.
For customer agreements that are past due, the Company's policy is to write-off lease merchandise after 120 days. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues was 4.8%, 5.4% and 7.2% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Vive's Credit Decisioning and Collection
Vive partners with merchants to provide a variety of revolving credit products originated through third-party federally insured banks to customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers (referred to as "second-look" financing programs). We believe Vive provides the following strategic benefits:
•Enhanced product for POS partners - Vive is able to drive more sales for its POS partners through its revolving credit products. Vive has a centralized, scalable underwriting model with a long operating history, deployed through its third-party bank partners, and a proprietary receivable management system. 
•Expanded customer base - PROG Holdings is able to serve a broader base of consumers through Vive. Vive primarily serves customers with FICO scores between 600 and 700, which make up approximately a quarter of the United States population. These customers generally have credit profiles that are typically stronger than Progressive Leasing's current customers. Additionally, Vive's revolving credit products can be used for the purchase of services in addition to merchandise. 
•Proprietary decision algorithm and collection - Vive uses an underwriting model that provides standardized credit decisions, including borrowing limit amounts. Credit decisions are primarily based on a proprietary underwriting algorithm. Loans receivable are unsecured, and collections on loans receivable are managed in-house through Vive's call center and proprietary loans receivable management system. 
Customer Service
A critical component of the success of our operations is the commitment to develop good relationships with our customers. We consistently monitor consumer preferences and trends to ensure that our business models are aligned with our customers' needs. We believe that building a relationship with the customer that ensures customer satisfaction is critical to our long-term success. Our goal, therefore, is to develop a positive experience with our customers, and for our products, service and support in the minds of our customers from the moment they enter the stores, e-commerce websites or mobile apps of our POS partners.
We believe the strong focus on customer satisfaction generates repeat business from our customers and long-lasting relationships with our POS partners. Our customers are given access to products through multiple channels, including a network of POS partner store locations and e-commerce sites. Our customers benefit from Progressive Leasing's flexible payment alternatives, including early purchase options, reinstatement options, product replacement, discounts and other benefits. In addition, we offer payment deferral options and other payment adjustment options to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, such as to those customers who have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to increase leasing and financing transactions, we foster relationships with POS partners and existing customers to attract recurring business. Our Progressive Leasing segment offers centralized customer and retailer support through call centers located in Draper, Utah, Glendale, Arizona, virtual call center operations in El Paso and San Antonio, Texas and a third-party support vendor in Cali, Colombia. Our call center for Vive is located in Draper, Utah. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, substantially all call center representatives for Progressive Leasing and Vive have transitioned to working remotely. 
Our commitment to our customers is ongoing throughout their lease term. Progressive Leasing customers have the option to cancel their lease-to-own agreement and return the merchandise at any time. We provide customers the convenience to return merchandise by either scheduling a pick-up or shipping the merchandise to our warehouse in Draper, Utah. Progressive Leasing partners with multiple third party vendors to sell its returned merchandise. 
Purchasing and POS Partner Relationships
The following table details the percentage of Progressive Leasing's revenues attributable to different categories of merchandise offered by its POS partners:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Progressive Leasing POS Partner Merchandise Category | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Furniture, appliances and electronics | 57 | % | | 57 | % | 53 | %
Jewelry | 17 | % | | 14 | % | 16 | %
Mobile phones and accessories | 12 | % | | 13 | % | 12 | %
Mattresses | 7 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %
Automobile electronics and accessories | 4 | % | | 5 | % | 7 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %

Revenues from a POS partner are attributed to a single category even if the POS partner may carry merchandise across multiple categories.
Progressive Leasing also classifies some electronics within mobile phones and accessories, automobile electronics and accessories, and other.

The following table details the percentage of Vive's revenues attributable to different categories of services and merchandise offered by its POS partners:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Vive POS Partner Services and Merchandise Category1 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Furniture and Mattresses | 48 | % | | 41 | % | 32 | %
Medical | 25 | % | | 32 | % | 43 | %
Home Exercise and Home Improvement | 8 | % | | 9 | % | 8 | %
Other | 19 | % | | 18 | % | 17 | %

1Revenues from a POS partner are attributed to a single category even if the POS partner may offer services or merchandise across multiple categories.
During 2021, four POS partners each individually provided customer relationships that generated greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
Marketing and Advertising
Progressive Leasing actively markets its leasing services to help increase the purchasing power of its customers while driving new shoppers and incremental transactions for our POS partners. To accomplish these goals, we invest in digital, traditional, and in-store marketing, and our internal marketing team continually evaluates and optimizes this investment to maximize the benefit for our POS partners.
Our robust digital media program is comprised of paid search, digital display, mobile, video, and paid social. We are able to verify the impact of our paid digital media on in-store and online shopping trips and lease origination activity. Targeted, personalized email and SMS marketing campaigns leverage our large customer database, educating customers about lease-to-own offerings, and driving lease conversion and sales for our POS partners. In addition, Progressive Leasing offers a variety of in-store marketing materials to drive awareness at the point of sale.
All of these efforts help drive new and returning customers online and into retail locations each year, generating incremental sales for our POS partners.
Competition
Our Progressive Leasing segment competes with other lease-to-own companies (virtual and traditional store based), and to a lesser extent, consumer finance companies, and traditional and online sellers of merchandise that provide customers with various types of payment options. The virtual lease-to-own market is highly competitive. We believe that during times of increased consumer liquidity, such as when government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits were being paid in 2020 and the first half of 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our competitors become more aggressive in their decisioning or approval processes, which further increases the competition we face. The industry is also experiencing an increase in new products and services designed to compete for the traditional lease-to-own consumer. The emergence of these new products and services has resulted in consumers having various payment alternatives for the goods and services they desire, resulting in a highly competitive environment. Vive competes with banks, consumer finance companies, and other financial technology companies for customers desiring to purchase merchandise or services. Four also competes with these same financial service providers for customers desiring to purchase merchandise or services for cash or credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service, lease rates, interest rates, promotional rates, and other terms. 
Working Capital
Progressive Leasing's most significant working capital asset is merchandise on lease. As Progressive Leasing continues to grow, the need for additional lease merchandise is expected to remain a major working capital requirement. Vive's most significant working capital assets are loans receivable. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to purchase such merchandise and acquire new loans through Vive's third-party bank partners. Four's most significant working capital assets are loans receivable, which require dependable sources of liquidity to purchase merchandise through Four's POS partners and affiliates. Failure to maintain adequate sources of liquidity to purchase lease merchandise and originate loans may materially adversely affect our Progressive Leasing, Vive, and Four businesses. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, and availability under our revolving credit facility are adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements. 
Human Capital
Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") is integral to our ability to grow and thrive. We respect the dignity and diversity of all people. We strive to nurture a culture of inclusion, holding all employees accountable for advancing our culture of belonging while supporting a diverse environment free from discrimination, harassment and bullying. 
By supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace, our employee resource groups help to ensure the many experiences of our diverse employees, customers and communities are reflected in our decisions and actions. We continue to focus on hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented groups. Our vision is to cultivate a welcoming and nurturing workplace that will activate the next generation of innovators. One of the ways we strive to achieve these goals is by providing executive, monetary and other support to our Employee Business Resource Groups ("BRGs"), all of which encourage and welcome participation from all employees in all positions and locations. Our BRGs work to ensure their members have a voice in the Company’s on-going conversations about DE&I matters, including strategy. Currently, our BRGs include:
•The Black Inclusion Group ("BIG"), whose mission is to enrich the experience of our African-American employees by providing professional and leadership development, networking, mentoring and social opportunities, while also promoting understanding of their concerns and views among all of our employees. BIG is focused on inclusion, engagement, learning and advancement initiatives intended to promote retention of African American employees. 
•Women In Leadership ("WIL"), an organization created to inspire female employees to develop their leadership abilities, prepare for and take advantage of career growth opportunities, and increase their knowledge of the Company for organizational and personal success, is focused on fostering the recruitment, development, advancement and retention of female employees, and helping all employees gain an appreciation of issues and topics of importance to our female employees.
•Adelante! provides a platform for highlighting and celebrating the richness of the Hispanic and LatinX communities’ heritages to promote cultural and issue awareness among all of our employees. This organization also facilitates professional and leadership development, networking, mentoring and social opportunities for Hispanic and LatinX employees, with the aim of fostering recruitment, development, advancement and retention of those employees.
•PROGPeople Respecting Individuality, Diversity and Equality ("PRIDE") seeks to foster a culture of understanding, diversity, inclusion and equality with our LGBTQ+ employees and allies, and encourages individuality, respect, professional development, and awareness of the challenges faced by, and issues that are important to, the LGBTQ+ community.
In addition to providing support to our BRGs, our efforts to promote DE&I practices include:
•Hosting internal and guest speakers to discuss topics relevant to DE&I matters;
•Conducting training to educate our employees about various DE&I themes, racial justice, disability inclusion and LGBTQ+ allyship, among other themes;
•Improving and formalizing mentorship programs targeted towards our female, minority and LGBTQ+ employees, which we expect to implement during 2022;
•Implementing a talent review process that is designed to utilize a multi-factor approach to understanding the talents of our employees and the potential they have to be future leaders of the Company.
As of December 31, 2021, our employee count was 1,849 for Progressive Leasing, 156 for Vive, and 18 for Four, the majority of which were full time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with employees are good.
The information in the tables below summarizes our gender, ethnicity and race diversity metrics as of December 31, 2021:

 | December 31, 2021
 | Male | Female
Vice Presidents and Above | 78.0 % | 22.0 %
All Other Employees | 49.1 % | 50.9 %


 | December 31, 2021

All Other Employees | 25.8 % | 56.2 % | 9.0 % | 1.2 % | 4.6 % | 0.7 % | 2.5 % 

We foster a culture of learning that provides employees with development opportunities to support their unique career paths. We support our employees in owning their development and growth, and we provide development training and resources to empower employees to achieve their personal best at work. We provide an online learning curriculum that includes content around compliance and specific business-related needs in multiple delivery formats, as well as tools, assessments, videos and digital learning modules, which are available live, in-person and online. 
We empower our employees to give to causes they feel passionately about, through volunteering, making financial donations, which we match up to certain limits, serving as nonprofit board members, and participating in our Company-sponsored Day of Service.
We work to ensure that our employment practices comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws, including those concerning equal opportunity, compensation and safe working conditions. We strive to achieve shared, meaningful goals and commit to open communication where individuals have no fear of expressing themselves freely and respectfully where, for example, they in good faith believe they need to raise a concern regarding a potential violation of law or Company policies.
We offer our employees fair and competitive wages and benefits which include (i) health benefits consisting of medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance; (ii) paid parental leave; (iii) Company matched 401(k); (iv) paid time off, paid holidays, and paid volunteer hours; (v) an employee stock purchase program; (vi) tuition reimbursement; and (vii) charitable gift matching. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, personnel expenses were $189.6 million, $170.3 million, and $160.0 million, respectively.
Seasonality
Progressive Leasing's revenue mix is moderately seasonal. Adjusting for growth, the first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the benefit of our POS partners' increases in business and higher lease originations during the fourth quarter holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods. 
Industry Overview
The Lease-to-Own Industry
The lease-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining home furnishings, electronics, appliances, computers, jewelry, and other consumer goods and services. In a standard industry lease-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 months, by making periodic lease payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to the lessor. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then obtains ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by tendering the contractually specified payment. 
The lease-to-own model is particularly attractive to customers who are unable to pay the full purchase price for merchandise upfront, and lack the credit to qualify for conventional financing programs. Other individuals who find the lease-to-own model attractive are customers who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, or have only a temporary need for the merchandise.
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), for example, which may exercise oversight of the advertising and other business practices of our Company. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings or financial condition. We continue to believe and set expectations that all employees are to behave in an ethical manner and to comply with all laws and regulations governing our Company's behavior.
A summary of certain laws under which we operate follows. This summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws regulating our operations.
Federal regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on the subprime and near-prime financial marketplace in which our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses operate. For example, in December 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") announced that is was reviewing the business practices of five companies that offer BNPL services and alleged risks associated with such BNPL offerings. While our Four business has not been contacted by the CFPB as of the date of this filing, we believe the CFPB's December announcement is illustrative of the greater focus federal regulatory authorities are putting on alternative financial services products, including within the industry in which our businesses operate, which may result in increased costs and the possibility of fines or other monetary penalties, settlements and costly changes to the manner in which we conduct our business. Any of these federal, as well as state, agencies may propose and adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations, in a manner that may result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. 
In addition, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance. From time to time, federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward our industry, or toward certain companies within the industry. For example, as we have disclosed previously, in July 2018 we received a civil investigative demand ("CID") from the FTC regarding disclosures related to lease-to-own and other financial products offered by the Company, and whether such disclosures are in violation of the FTC Act. Although we believe such disclosures were in compliance with the FTC Act and have not admitted to any wrongdoing, we reached a settlement with the FTC under which we agreed to make a lump sum payment of $175.0 million to the FTC, and entered into a consent order which, among other matters, required Progressive Leasing to enhance certain compliance related activities, including monitoring, disclosure and reporting requirements. The proposed consent order was approved by the FTC on April 17, 2020 and approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on April 22, 2020. The Company paid the $175.0 million settlement amount to the FTC on April 27, 2020. The settlement and related consent order may lead to investigations and enforcement actions by, and/or consent orders with, state attorneys general and regulatory agencies. We cannot predict whether any state attorneys general or federal regulatory agencies will direct other investigations or regulatory initiatives towards us or our industry in the future, or what the impact of any such future regulatory initiatives may be.
In addition to federal regulatory oversight, currently, nearly every state specifically regulates lease-to-own transactions via state statutes. This includes states in which our Progressive Leasing business has POS partners. Most state lease purchase laws require lease-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more 
restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the retail price for an item, limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that lease-to-own companies may charge on lease-to-own transactions. With respect to the regulation of the "cost-of-rental" amount, such laws generally define "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Progressive Leasing's long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of its lease purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with various state lease purchase laws. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the lease-to-own transaction. Moreover, federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of Progressive Leasing's business including matters such as collections activity, marketing disclosures to customers and customer contact may be subject to federal laws and regulation. 
Vive is subject to various federal and state laws that address lending regulations, consumer information, consumer rights, and certain credit card specific requirements. In addition, Vive services credit cards issued through third party bank partners and therefore is subject to those banks' Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulators. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our Progressive Leasing, Vive, Four or other business operations.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, service mark, trade name and copyright laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection. We own, or are otherwise entitled to use, the various trademarks, trade names, and service marks used in our businesses, including those used with the operations of Progressive Leasing, Vive, and Four. We intend to file for additional trade name and trademark protection when appropriate.
Although we rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections, in our business, we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our intellectual property and proprietary rights through appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and frequent enhancements to our network are also essential to establishing and maintaining our competitive position.
