Overview
 Reata’s mission is to develop innovative therapies that change patients’ lives for the better.  We focus on developing small-molecule therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases with few or no approved therapies.  Our lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl (Bard) and omaveloxolone (Omav), activate the transcription factor Nrf2, which plays an important role in regulating the cellular response to injury.  By activating Nrf2, Bard and Omav normalize mitochondrial function, restore redox balance, and resolve inflammation.  We have fully enrolled two registrational clinical trials: CARDINAL, studying Bard in chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by Alport syndrome, and MOXIe, studying Omav in Friedreich’s ataxia (FA).  CKD caused by Alport syndrome and FA are rare, serious diseases with no approved therapy.  We designed CARDINAL and MOXIe based on the results of earlier clinical studies and guidance from the FDA on a potential path to approval.  We expect to have top-line data from both of these clinical trials in the second half of 2019.  If we receive FDA approval based on either of these trials, it may provide expansion opportunities into other related indications.  We are also conducting a third registrational trial, CATALYST, studying Bard in patients with a rare and serious form of pulmonary arterial hypertension caused by connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH), and we expect to have top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2020.  We expect our current cash to fund our operations through data readouts for these three ongoing registrational clinical trials.
 We are developing Bard for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other rare forms of CKD that, in the aggregate, affect more than 700,000 patients in the United States.  CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  When GFR gets too low, patients typically develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  In 10 separate CKD clinical trials, Bard has been shown to consistently improve estimated GFR (eGFR) in patients with diverse etiologies of CKD.  We believe that Bard treatment has the potential to delay or prevent GFR declines that cause the need for dialysis or a transplant in patients with Alport syndrome, ADPKD, and other rare forms of CKD.  
 We are conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trial studying Bard in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome called CARDINAL.  Alport syndrome affects both children and adults and, in patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age of 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.   In the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 48 weeks of treatment in 25 patients.  Available historical data for 22 of these patients showed an average annual decline in eGFR of 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the three-year period prior to study entry.  Bard also demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR at Week 52 after withdrawal of drug for four weeks.  This retained eGFR benefit is important because it provides compelling evidence that drug treatment may delay or prevent the need for dialysis or transplant.  The FDA has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of Bard treatment may support accelerated approval, and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.  The Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of Bard in 157 Alport syndrome patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We have fully enrolled the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL, and we expect to have one year top-line results available in the second half of 2019.  If the trial results are positive, we believe the results, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Bard for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome.
 We are currently initiating a Phase 3 trial studying Bard in patients with ADPKD called FALCON.  ADPKD is a rare and serious hereditary form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in genes called PKD1 or PKD2 and is characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys.  ADPKD is the most common single-gene disorder of the kidneys, and there are an estimated 400,000 patients in the United States, with approximately 140,000 patients diagnosed with the disease.  During 2018, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial studying Bard in patients with ADPKD.  In the Phase 2 study, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in 31 patients.  Available historical data for 29 of these patients showed an average annual decline in eGFR of 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the three-year period prior to study entry.  The FDA has provided us with written 
 5

guidance that, in patients with ADPKD, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of Bard treatment may support accelerated approval, and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.  FALCON is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of Bard in approximately 300 ADPKD patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We plan to enroll the first ADPKD patient in FALCON in mid-2019.
 We also collected Phase 2 data studying Bard in each of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), type 1 diabetic CKD (T1D CKD), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  In each of these Phase 2 cohorts, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in patients whose available historical data showed annual declines in eGFR in the three-year period prior to study entry
.  We believe that a registrational clinical trial similar to the design of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and FALCON trials with a two-year duration and a retained eGFR benefit endpoint after one and two years of treatment may be acceptable for submission of an NDA for these forms of CKD to the FDA.  We plan to pursue each of these rare and serious forms of CKD as commercial indications.
 In addition to our CKD development programs, we are conducting a registrational Phase 2 clinical trial, part 2 of MOXIe, studying our second Nrf2 activator, Omav, in patients with FA.  FA is a rare, inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the gene for frataxin, a mitochondrial protein.  Patients with FA are typically dependent on wheelchair use 10 to 15 years after disease onset, and their median age of death is in the mid-30s.  There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  In part 1 of MOXIe, at the optimal dose level, Omav demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in modified Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores of 3.8 points (p=0.0001) versus baseline and a placebo-corrected improvement in mFARS scores of 2.3 points (p=0.06).  Part 2 of MOXIe is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of Omav in 103 FA patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  The FDA has provided us with written guidance that the mFARS score is acceptable as the primary endpoint for part 2 of MOXIe and that it may consider either accelerated or full approval based on the overall results of the trial and strength of the data.  We have fully enrolled the trial, and we expect to have top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2019.  If the trial results are positive, we believe the trial results, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Omav for the treatment of FA.
 We are also conducting a Phase 3 trial studying Bard in patients with CTD-PAH called CATALYST.  CTD-PAH is a rare, serious and progressive disease that leads to heart failure and death.  CTD-PAH patients are less responsive to existing vasodilator therapies than patients with the idiopathic form of PAH (I-PAH) and have a worse prognosis.  We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial called LARIAT in patients with PAH.  In LARIAT, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant time-averaged increase in mean 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 16 weeks in CTD-PAH patients compared to baseline.  Based on discussions with the FDA, the primary endpoint of CATALYST is the change from baseline in 6MWD compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.  CATALYST is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of Bard in approximately 200 CTD-PAH patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We expect to have top-line data from the CATALYST trial in the first half of 2020.  If the trial results are positive, we believe the results, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Bard for the treatment of CTD-PAH.
 In addition to our lead programs, we are currently exploring a battery of additional clinical and preclinical programs in diseases that may provide meaningful expansion opportunities for Bard and Omav. We also have completed or have ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials with RTA 901, a highly potent and selective C-terminal modulator of Hsp90, and RTA 1701, our lead product candidate from our proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors.

Foundational Biology of Our Nrf2 Activators, Our Lead Programs


 
1 | Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. In many inflammatory diseases, mitochondrial metabolism becomes dysfunctional and is reprogrammed to suppress the production of ATP and increase the production of chemically-reactive molecules called “reactive oxygen species” or ROS. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Once released from the mitochondria, ROS amplify pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, and increase the production of cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and IL-6. The persistent production of cytokines, impaired redox balance, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to fibrosis and reduced organ function. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | By binding to Keap1, Bard and Omav stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4 | Nrf2 activation normalizes mitochondrial metabolism and increases ATP production. It also increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes and systems that work together to reduce the levels of ROS and restore redox balance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5 | By normalizing mitochondrial metabolism and restoring redox balance, Nrf2 inhibits proinflammatory signaling. In addition, Nrf2 directly suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes by inhibiting their transcription. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chronic, unresolved inflammation and impaired cellular metabolism are key features of many diseases.  Inflammation is an integral component of the normal immune response that occurs when cells encounter harmful stimuli, such as invading pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.  During inflammation, cells activate inflammatory processes and complexes that increase the production of cytokines, which are proteins that recruit and activate immune cells.
 Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of the cell as they produce the energy that the cell needs to function. This energy is produced by converting fatty acids and glucose into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a process called oxidative phosphorylation. During inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism is temporarily reprogrammed to suppress oxidative phosphorylation.   Instead of primarily making ATP, the mitochondria divert fatty acids and glucose to increase the production of proinflammatory mediators. During this reprogramming, the mitochondria release chemically-reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can directly attack pathogens and amplify the production of cytokines.
 In a normal immune response, the resolution of inflammation begins after the harmful stimuli have been eliminated.  Nrf2 is a protein that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of specific genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production.  When activated, Nrf2 promotes the resolution of inflammation by normalizing mitochondrial metabolism, restoring redox balance, and suppressing cytokine production.  In many chronic and genetic diseases, Nrf2 activity is suppressed, and the resolution of inflammation fails to occur or is inadequate, leading to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, excess production of ROS, and production of cytokines. These processes cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to tissue damage and loss of organ function.  
 Bard and Omav are Nrf2 activators that selectively bind to Keap1, a protein that governs the activity of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress. By binding to Keap1, Bard and Omav stabilize Nrf2 and increase its activity.  Since mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, Nrf2 activators, such as Bard and Omav, may have many potential clinical applications.  Bard and Omav have been extensively studied by many investigators. Their tissue protective and therapeutic effects have been observed in many preclinical models and are associated with meaningful improvements in hallmarks of disease progression, such as inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis.  Our Nrf2 activators are the subject of over 400 peer-reviewed publications, and have been studied in over 50 preclinical animal models in which they have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, tissue protective, or anti-fibrotic effects in the kidney, heart, brain, liver, lungs, vasculature, fat tissue, pancreas, bone marrow, intestines, eyes, spinal cord, prostate, inner ear, and skin.

Our Programs


Bard for the Treatment of Rare CKD 
 We are developing Bard for the treatment of patients with five rare forms of CKD that, in the aggregate, affect more than 700,000 patients in the United States.  CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in GFR, the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood.  When GFR falls too low, patients typically develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  Dialysis leads to a reduced quality of life and increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications.  The five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is only approximately 42%.  The number of patients with kidney failure in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades with an estimated 725,000 patients as of 2016.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  Other than tolvaptan, which is approved for ADPKD, the only approved therapies in the United States that affect disease progression for any form of CKD are blood pressure medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) approved for diabetic kidney disease, that modestly slow the rate of kidney function loss.  There are no other approved therapies in the United States for Alport syndrome or the four additional rare forms of CKD addressed by our program.
 The initiating events that promote CKD can be quite different, but a substantial body of evidence has emerged that inflammation is a final common pathway promoting progression in most forms of CKD.  Bard has been evaluated in many preclinical models of CKD and, unlike blood pressure medications, it addresses
 inflammation in the kidney.  In preclinical studies that are the subject of more than 40 recent peer-reviewed publications, Bard and related analogs have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve kidney function, or prevent injury, remodeling, or fibrosis of the kidney in many animal models of kidney disease.  Bard has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials enrolling over 2,000 patients exposed to active drug and has been shown to consistently improve kidney function as measured by eGFR and other markers of kidney function.  As a consequence, we believe that Bard treatment has the potential to delay or prevent the loss of kidney function that causes the need for dialysis or a transplant in patients with Alport syndrome and other rare forms of CKD.  
 9

Our lead clinical program in rare forms of CKD is studying the safety and efficacy of Bard treatment in patients with Alport syndrome in a registrational Phase 3 study called CARDINAL.  We designed CARDINAL based on guidance from the FDA on a potential path to approval.  We have fully enrolled CARDINAL, and we expect to have one-year top-line results available in the second half of 2019.  We have completed our Phase 2 trial PHOENIX, studying Bard in each of ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS.  In each of these Phase 2 studies, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in patients whose available historical data showed annual declines in eGFR in the three-year period prior to study entry.  Based on these results, we are currently initiating a Phase 3 trial studying Bard in patients with ADPKD called FALCON.  We designed FALCON based on the results of our Phase 2 program and guidance from the FDA on a potential path to approval.  We plan to enroll the first ADPKD patient in FALCON in mid-2019.  Based on the Phase 2 results, we plan to pursue IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS as commercial indications.
 Background on Rare Forms of CKD, eGFR, and the Burden of ESKD and Dialysis
 CKD is characterized by a progressive loss in the rate at which the kidney is filtering blood, called GFR.  CKD generally results from diabetic complications, hypertension, obesity, genetic defects, or autoimmunity.  The initiating events that promote CKD can be quite different, but a substantial body of evidence has emerged that inflammation is a common underlying feature for most forms of CKD.  
 Declining kidney function leads to the buildup of high levels of waste products in the blood that causes the patient to suffer symptoms, such as nausea and fatigue, and to develop complications including high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.  eGFR is an estimate of GFR that nephrologists use to track the decline in kidney function and progression of CKD.  Normal individuals have an eGFR of approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m2.  When eGFR declines to approximately 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or below, patients generally develop ESKD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  
 Dialysis leads to a reduced quality of life, and most patients must spend several hours at a dialysis clinic three times a week for the remainder of their life and may suffer side effects due to dialysis. Dialysis also increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular disease, and the five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is only approximately 42%.  The number of patients with ESKD in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades with an estimated 725,000 patients as of 2016.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  In 2015, Medicare spending for CKD was $98 billion, of which $34 billion was spent on patients with ESKD.  Other than tolvaptan, which is approved for ADPKD, the only approved therapies in the United States that affect disease progression for any form of CKD are blood pressure medications, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, approved for diabetic kidney disease, that modestly slow the rate of kidney function loss.  There are no other approved therapies in the United States for Alport syndrome or the four additional rare forms of CKD addressed by our program.
 Bard Targets Inflammatory Pathways that Contribute to GFR Loss and ESKD
 Inflammatory processes initiated by a variety of pathogenic stimuli, including diabetes, systemic hypertension, IgA deposition, and genetic mutations drive declining kidney function.  At the molecular level, these pathogenic stimuli activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that normally detect cellular damage or pathogens.  These signals induce mitochondrial dysfunction in which production of ATP is impaired in favor of production of pro-inflammatory mitochondrial ROS.  ROS production activates pro-inflammatory signaling complexes including NF-κB to produce TNFα, IL-6, IL-1, IFNγ, angiotensin II, and other cytokines that initiate inflammatory pathways in glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and podocytes, while also recruiting activated macrophages and other inflammatory effector cells to the renal interstitium.  At the physiological level, chronic activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in these kidney cells promotes GFR loss.  Glomerular endothelial dysfunction and mesangial cell contraction are dynamic processes that impair GFR by reducing the glomerular surface area for filtration.  Chronic activation of inflammatory pathways also leads to GFR loss through GBM thickening and glomerular sclerosis.

Bard targets inflammatory pathways that contribute to kidney function loss.  The activity of Nrf2, the target of Bard, has been shown to protect the kidney in preclinical studies that are the subject of many peer-reviewed manuscripts.  Nrf2 gene ablation intensifies inflammation, oxidative stress, and kidney injury, remodeling, and fibrosis in multiple animal models of kidney disease.  Nrf2-knockout mice exhibit a lupus-like autoimmune nephritis, and histologic analyses of kidney tissue show impaired antioxidant activity and increased oxidative damage including enlarged glomeruli, mesangial cell proliferation, GBM thickening, and glomerulosclerosis.  Kidney function is compromised in these animals, as evidenced by a significant decrease in creatinine clearance and survival.  Similarly, Nrf2-knockout mice are more susceptible to nephrotoxic insults and develop more severe kidney impairment in multiple animal models of kidney disease.   
 In a large biopsy study of 157 patients representing nine different types of CKD, patients’ biopsy samples were analyzed to determine genes and mutations associated with kidney function, as assessed clinically by eGFR. Etiologies of CKD included thin basement membrane nephropathy, of which most are now considered patients with Alport syndrome, IgAN, diabetes, FSGS, hypertension, lupus, and others. Eighteen genes and 97 molecular pathways were identified that affect eGFR.  Two clusters of pathways were identified that comprise inflammation and metabolic pathways, and Nrf2 was identified as a central link. Collectively, these data establish that Nrf2 plays an important role in maintaining the function and structure of the kidney.  They also demonstrate that Nrf2 affects a final common pathway of progression across diverse etiologies of CKD.
 
Bard is an Nrf2 activator that selectively binds to Keap1, a protein that governs the activity of Nrf2 in response to cellular stress.  By binding to Keap1, Bard stabilizes Nrf2 and increases its activity.  Through Nrf2, Bard activates molecular pathways that promote the resolution of inflammation by restoring mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling.  Bard and closely related structural analogs have been shown to improve kidney function, reduce inflammation, and prevent injury, remodeling, and fibrosis in a number of preclinical models of kidney injury and disease.  In particular, Bard and related analogs have been shown to reduce hyperfiltration-mediated fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis in the pressure overload model of CKD, to reduce tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis in a high protein model of CKD, and to reverse endothelial dysfunction and mesangial cell contraction in response to angiotensin II, thereby improving glomerular function and GFR.  Thus, Bard and analogs have been shown to be protective in several animal models of kidney disease and have been demonstrated to preserve kidney function and prevent structural remodeling and fibrosis in the kidney.
 
Filtration of blood in the kidney is governed by intraglomerular pressure and surface area of the glomerular capillaries, and reductions in GFR therefore directly correlate with decreases in glomerular surface area.  Activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in the kidney promotes GFR loss by at least three mechanisms.  Two of these mechanisms, glomerular endothelial dysfunction and mesangial cell contraction, are dynamic processes that decrease glomerular surface area and GFR.  Inflammation-associated processes deplete vasodilatory nitric oxide, resulting in loss of glomerular endothelial function.  Mesangial cells regulate blood flow by their contractile activity, and inflammation and oxidative stress induces mesangial cell contraction to reduce the surface area for filtration and the single nephron GFR.  Chronic activation of inflammatory pathways also leads to long-term structural alterations in the mesangium, which results in reduced glomerular surface area and GFR.  
 Overview of Clinical Trials of Bard in CKD 
 Bard has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials enrolling over 2,000 patients exposed to active drug, including those with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, type 2 diabetic CKD (T2D CKD), and FSGS.  Bard has been shown to consistently improve kidney function as measured by eGFR and other markers of kidney function in numerous clinical trials.  Key findings from clinical trials of Bard’s effects on kidney function are summarized below.
 11

Bard Demonstrated Improvements in Kidney Function as Assessed by eGFR, Measured GFR (Inulin Clearance), Creatinine Clearance, and other Measures
 Bard’s effects on kidney function have been assessed using the “gold standard” inulin clearance method of directly measuring GFR.  In TSUBAKI, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted by our licensee, KHK, Bard demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in directly-measured GFR.  Moreover, directly-measured GFR increases were significantly and positively correlated with improvements in eGFR.  In several studies, Bard significantly increased creatinine clearance, another assessment of kidney function.  These increases were not associated with a change in total 24-hour excretion of creatinine, which demonstrates that Bard does not affect creatinine metabolism.  In other CKD studies, Bard has been shown to significantly reduce blood waste products in inverse correlation to eGFR increases and to numerically reduce kidney serious adverse events (SAEs) and ESKD events.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that the increases in eGFR observed in multiple CKD studies of Bard treatment reflect improvements in kidney function and support the use of eGFR as a reliable marker of kidney function.
 Bard Demonstrated Improvement in Kidney Function in Diverse Types of CKD and in a High Percentage of Treated Patients within Each Subtype of CKD
 The safety and efficacy of Bard treatment have been studied in clinical trials of patients with six different types of CKD.  Bard has produced statistically significant improvements in eGFR versus baseline or placebo in patients Alport syndrome, ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, T2D CKD, and FSGS.  A high percentage of patients, called responders, in each subtype of CKD treated with Bard experienced improvements in kidney function.  The observed broad and consistent improvements in kidney function demonstrated with Bard treatment suggest that Bard’s mechanism is targeting a common pathogenic feature of many types of CKD.
 
Patients with CKD have been treated with Bard for one year or longer in three prior trials, with no evidence of an increased risk of kidney toxicity, as assessed by kidney SAEs, ESKD events, or the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful loss of eGFR. Additionally, there has been no evidence of kidney injury based on validated markers of kidney injury (urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG)).  Apart from the patient-specific fluid overload events observed in advanced T2D CKD patients (discussed below), Bard was well-tolerated and appears to possess a favorable clinical safety profile.  The most common AEs associated with Bard treatment in previous trials included muscle spasms (34%), pain (18%), nausea (18%), hypomagnesemia (15%), fatigue (15%), decreased appetite (14%), and weight loss (13%).
 Bard Treatment Produced Sustained eGFR Improvements and Reduced the Risk of Adverse Kidney Outcomes
 In three separate clinical trials, Bard treatment produced increases in eGFR in CKD patients treated for one year or longer.  In the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR of 10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 48 weeks of treatment.  Historical data available for 22 of the patients showed eGFR declined an average of 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the three-year period prior to enrolling in the trial. This magnitude of improvement in mean eGFR represents the recovery of over two years of average decline in kidney function in Alport syndrome patients in this trial.  
 In BEACON, a large, international Phase 3 trial in patients with T2D CKD, Bard-treated patients had increases in mean eGFR through Week 48 of 5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In contrast, placebo-treated patients experienced a decline in mean eGFR of 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to a statistically significant relative difference between groups of 6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001).  In BEAM, a randomized, placebo-controlled 52-week Phase 2 trial in patients with T2D CKD, Bard-treated patients at the mid- and high doses had increases in mean eGFR through Week 48 of 14.9 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In contrast, placebo-treated patients experienced a decline in mean eGFR of 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to a statistically significant relative difference between groups of 16.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001).
 In BEACON, post-hoc analysis showed that patients randomized to Bard were significantly less likely to experience adverse kidney outcomes as defined by a composite endpoint consisting of ≥30% decline from baseline in eGFR, eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or ESKD events (HR=0.48, p<0.0001).  This composite endpoint has recently been validated by a joint FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the National Kidney Foundation working group.  Furthermore, Bard treatment resulted in a decreased number of kidney-related SAEs and ESKD events.  The data suggest that Bard treatment preserves kidney function and may delay the onset of kidney failure in patients with T2D and stage 4 CKD.

Bard Treatment Produced a Retained eGFR Benefit after Withdrawal of Drug Suggesting Bard Modified the Course of CKD
 The FDA has provided guidance to us and other sponsors that clinical trials with a retained eGFR benefit analysis may support approval in certain rare forms of CKD.  The retained eGFR benefit is the patient’s eGFR change compared to baseline after long-term treatment of approximately one year and withdrawal of active drug.  We believe measuring eGFR after withdrawal of active drug isolates, and allows the measurement of, the functional improvement associated with the effect of the drug on the underlying structure of the kidney.  If the drug produces an improvement in retained eGFR versus placebo, it is strong evidence that the drug has modified the course of the disease and may delay or prevent the need for dialysis or a transplant.  
 The duration of withdrawal varies by drug and is based on the drug’s pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) profile, including the time it takes for a drug to reach sub-therapeutic concentrations and the reversal of PD markers.  Bard is eliminated from the system within 10 days after cessation of drug treatment, and the FDA has indicated that a four-week withdrawal period, which represents approximately 17 half-lives of the drug, is appropriate for Bard in the Phase 3 CARDINAL and FALCON studies.
 We assessed retained eGFR benefit in three clinical trials: BEAM, BEACON, and the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL.  In each of those trials, after patients had been treated with Bard for approximately one year, the drug was withdrawn for four weeks, and the post-withdrawal eGFR was compared to the patient’s baseline eGFR.  In each of these trials, Bard treatment produced a statistically significant improvement in retained eGFR versus baseline after withdrawal of drug.  To our knowledge, Bard is the first therapy to produce a retained eGFR benefit that is above baseline in a long-term CKD trial.  We believe the retained eGFR benefit observed in these clinical trials demonstrates that Bard treatment improved the structure of the kidney, modified the course of the disease, and may prevent or delay kidney failure and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.  The FDA has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome or ADPKD, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of Bard treatment may support accelerated approval and an improvement versus placebo 
after two years of treatment may support full approval. 
 Bard Development Program for the Treatment of CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease caused by a genetic defect in type IV collagen, a component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney, which results in alterations to the GBM structure and impairs its function.  Compromised GBM, along with other disease factors, contributes to chronic inflammation, which results in glomerular scarring, interstitial fibrosis, and progressive loss of kidney function.  Patients with Alport syndrome experience an average annual decline in eGFR of 3 to 4 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In patients with the most severe forms of Alport syndrome, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age of 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  The goal of current disease management is to slow the progression of CKD, beginning with anti-hypertensives, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which are intended to reduce the rate of kidney function loss.  
 The Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL is an international, multi-center, randomized trial, which is double-blind and placebo-controlled, that studies the safety and efficacy of Bard in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  We have completed enrollment of CARDINAL with 157 patients, randomized one-to-one to either Bard or placebo, at approximately 50 sites in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.  We will assess on-treatment eGFR at 48 weeks and retained eGFR at 52 weeks.  After 52 weeks, patients will be restarted on study drug with their original treatment assignments and will continue on study drug for a second year.  The second-year on-treatment eGFR will be measured after 100 weeks and the retained eGFR will be measured at Week 104.  All patients who complete the treatment period are eligible to continue into an extension trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of Bard.  Those patients who had been receiving placebo will be converted to Bard in the extension trial.  One-year top-line results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL are expected to be available in the second half of 2019.  The trial is being overseen by a data monitoring committee (DMC) that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis, to assess safety.  The DMC has not reported any safety concerns to date.

In the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, Bard demonstrated a sustained eGFR improvement in patients whose disease was actively progressing on standard of care.  In 25 patients, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean eGFR of 10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 48 weeks of treatment.  Historical data available for 22 of the patients showed eGFR declined an average of 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the three-year period prior to enrolling in the trial.  This magnitude of improvement in eGFR represents the recovery of over two years of average decline in kidney function in Alport syndrome patients in this trial.  Further, all patients in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL had an increase in eGFR from baseline at Week 12, and these increases in eGFR translated to an improvement in CKD stage for approximately 73% of patients.  No treatment-related SAEs were reported, and the reported AEs have generally been mild to moderate in intensity.  


In the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, Bard also demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean retained eGFR of 4.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.05) at Week 52.  To our knowledge, Bard is the first therapy to produce a retained eGFR benefit that is above baseline in a long-term CKD trial.  As noted above, we believe measuring eGFR after withdrawal of active drug isolates, and allows the measure of, the functional improvement associated with the effect of the drug on the underlying structure of the kidney.  We believe the retained eGFR benefit observed in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL provides evidence that Bard treatment improved the structure of the kidney, modified the course of the disease, and may prevent or delay kidney failure and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.
 14

As shown in the figure below, Phase 3 modeling1 based on this one year retained eGFR benefit and the annual average historical eGFR decline of 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 suggests a potential placebo-corrected retained benefit of 8.3 mL/min/1.73 m2.  The Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL, at 157 patients, is conservatively powered to detect a placebo-corrected retained benefit of 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m2.

 The FDA has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of Bard treatment may support accelerated approval and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.  If the results of the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL are positive, we believe the results, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Bard for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Bard for the treatment of Alport syndrome.
 Bard Development Program for the Treatment of ADPKD
 ADPKD is an inherited, rare form of CKD caused by a genetic defect in PKD1 or PKD2 and is characterized by formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys.  Inflammation appears to play a role in cyst growth and is associated with disease progression in ADPKD. PKD1 is the most common mutation, causing about 85% of ADPKD cases and patients with the PKD1 mutation to progress to ESKD, on average, by age 54.  ADPKD is the most common single-gene disorder of the kidneys, and there are an estimated 400,000 patients in the United States, with approximately 140,000 diagnosed.  The only therapy currently approved for ADPKD is tolvaptan, which was approved in the United States during 2018.
 We are initiating a pivotal Phase 3 trial called FALCON in patients with ADPKD.  FALCON is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and efficacy of Bard in approximately 300 ADPKD patients randomized one-to-one to active drug or placebo.  We plan to enroll the first ADPKD patient in FALCON during mid-2019.  We will measure the retained eGFR benefit at 52 weeks.  After 52 weeks, patients will be restarted on study drug with their original treatment assignments and will continue on study drug for a second year.  The second-year retained eGFR benefit will be measured at Week 104.
 15

FALCON was designed and powered based on data from the ADPKD cohort of the Phase 2 PHOENIX trial.  In PHOENIX, Bard demonstrated a statistically significant increase in eGFR of 9.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 12 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with ADPKD.  Historical data available for 29 of the patients showed that their eGFR declined an average of 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the three-year period prior to enrolling in the trial.  The magnitude of improvement in eGFR observed with Bard represents the recovery of approximately two years of average decline in kidney function in the patients in this trial.  The ADPKD patients showed a high response rate, with all but one patient showing improvement at Week 12.  No drug-related serious adverse events were reported, and reported adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity.


As shown in the figure below, Phase 3 modeling1 estimates a retained eGFR of 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the Bard group relative to baseline.  The modeled retained eGFR benefit is based on 30% of the Week 12 eGFR benefit of 9.3 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In BEAM, BEACON, and the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, Bard treatment produced a statistically significant improvement in retained eGFR versus baseline or placebo after withdrawal of drug.  The acute increase in eGFR from Bard treatment observed at 12 weeks was predictive of the on-treatment eGFR change after one year of treatment and associated with a retained eGFR benefit.  In addition, a placebo decline of 3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (less than the annual eGFR decline observed prior to study entry in ADPKD patients in PHOENIX) has been estimated based on several recently published ADPKD trials, which suggests a potential placebo-corrected retained benefit of 6.2 mL/min/1.73 m2.  FALCON is powered to detect a placebo-corrected retained benefit of 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m2.  


1Modeled changes are not intended as a forecast of probable results.  No assurance is given about the results that will be obtained.
 The FDA has provided us with written guidance that, in patients with ADPKD, an analysis of retained eGFR demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of Bard treatment may support accelerated approval and an improvement versus placebo after two years of treatment may support full approval.  If the trial results are positive, we believe the results, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Bard for the treatment of ADPKD.

Bard Development Program for the Treatment of Other Rare Kidney Diseases
 We believe the mechanism of action of Bard addresses a final common pathway of kidney function loss, and we have observed significant increases in eGFR in patients with declining kidney function from a variety of diseases.  As a consequence, we conducted a Phase 2 trial called PHOENIX to assess whether Bard treatment can improve kidney function in patients with four rare forms of CKD:  ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS.  IgAN is a rare form of CKD caused by deposition of IgA complexes in the kidney and is estimated to affect 120,000 patients in the United States.  CKD is a common complication of T1D and is estimated to affect 20% of the approximately one million T1D patients in the United States.  FSGS is a rare form of CKD that results from the chronic inflammation and scarring of the glomeruli and affects an estimated 40,000 patients in the United States.
 PHOENIX was an open-label, multi-center Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Bard in patients with ADPKD, IgAN, T1D CKD, or FSGS.  A total of 103 patients were enrolled in the study in four separate cohorts, including 31 patients with ADPKD, 26 with IgAN, 28 with T1D CKD, and 18 with FSGS.  Patients were treated with Bard for 12 weeks in all four cohorts, and all four cohorts showed statistically significant increases in mean eGFR, as shown in the table below. 
 
 
 | Week 12 ΔeGFR (Mean ± SE) | P-value vs. Baseline
ADPKD (n=31) | 9.3 ± 1.4 | P < 0.0001 
IgAN (n=26) | 8.0 ± 1.6 | P < 0.0001 
T1D (n=28) | 5.5 ± 2.3 | P = 0.02 
FSGS (n=18) | 7.8 ± 2.2 | P = 0.003 
All (n=103) | 7.8 ± 0.9 | P < 0.0001 

 Each cohort achieved a statistically significant increase in mean eGFR at Week 12, and there was a consistent response across cohorts.  Of the patients that reached Week 12, 88% experienced increases in eGFR at Week 12.  Bard significantly reduced mean systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mmHg (n=103; p=0.002) and mean diastolic blood pressure by 2.8mmHG (n=103; p=0.0009).  Urinary albumin excretion was low upon study entry and remained unchanged by Bard treatment (n-103; p=0.6).  The most commonly reported AE across all cohorts was muscle spasms, which were not associated with clinical signs or symptoms of muscle injury.  No SAEs were reported as related to Bard.
 Based on the eGFR improvements observed in PHOENIX patients, we plan to pursue IgAN, T1D CKD, and FSGS as commercial indications.  We believe that a registrational clinical trial similar to the design of the Phase 3 CARDINAL and FALCON trials with a two-year duration and a retained eGFR benefit endpoint after one and two years of treatment would be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of Bard for the treatment of these forms of CKD.
 Commercial and Manufacturing Preparations for Bard in Rare CKD
 We are in the process of preparing for a potential commercial launch of Bard in Alport syndrome in the United States.  Our ability to launch Bard is dependent on a successful outcome of the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL, the successful filing and defense of an NDA, and approval by the FDA.  We have hired commercial and medical affairs leaders, and we are building the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for the launch of Bard in the United States, including sales, marketing, market access, patient support, medical affairs, distribution, quality, and compliance functions.
 If we receive approval for Bard in Alport syndrome, we plan to utilize a specialty pharmacy distribution model to support product availability to patients, with a patient-centered hub to support on-label utilization, ease of access, and patient education and compliance.  We have completed preliminary field force sizing and structure for sales and access teams.  The trade naming process is underway. We have launched disease awareness campaigns to educate physicians about Alport syndrome. 
 17

Our manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support commercial supply and distribution.  We have made good progress to establish a robust supply chain to adequately support clinical and near-term commercial demand after launch.  We have completed process validation batches for drug substance and registration batches for drug product.  A three-year, room temperature shelf life is currently established for clinical-image Bard capsules at multiple doses, which is anticipated to reflect commercial product.  In addition, our synthesis process from regulatory starting material to drug substance results in a reasonable cost of goods.
 Bard Development Program for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetic CKD
 Early Termination of BEACON Study
 Prior to initiating the current clinical development programs, Bard was evaluated in six Phase 1 and 2 studies in patients with T2D CKD that demonstrated significant improvements in kidney function as evidenced by increases in eGFR and other markers of kidney function as discussed above.  Based on the Phase 2 results, we conducted BEACON, a large, international Phase 3 trial in patients with T2D CKD.  In 2010, when the study was initiated, guidance from the FDA required the study to demonstrate that Bard treatment significantly reduce the risk of ESKD and death events for approval.  Because CKD patients’ kidney function declines very slowly over a long period of time, BEACON enrolled only severe or Stage 4 CKD patients that had baseline eGFR values close to the threshold for ESKD.
 During October 2012, BEACON was terminated in response to the independent DMC’s recommendation to stop the trial for safety concerns.  After the trial was terminated, analysis revealed that there was a small but significant imbalance in heart failure events of 5.0% on placebo and 8.8% on active drug, but no statistical difference in mortality.  The primary reason for the increase in heart failure events was fluid overload that occurred in the first four weeks after randomization.  Patients with fluid overload events who were treated with intravenous diuretics resolved their symptoms, and there was no increase in risk for fluid overload, as compared to placebo, after the first four weeks of treatment.
 Development of Risk Mitigation Plan for Fluid Retention
 Further investigation, including additional preclinical studies, indicated that Bard modulates the endothelin pathway.  In patients with Stage 4 and 5 diabetic CKD, the endothelin pathway is dysregulated, and, under certain circumstances, activation of this pathway can put these patients at greater risk for fluid retention.  Patients who have less compromised kidney function do not have dysregulation of this pathway, and their kidneys are able to excrete excess fluid.  Similar fluid overload events had been observed previously in patients with late-stage diabetic CKD treated with other therapies, including endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), which are vasodilating agents that are currently approved for the treatment of PAH.  This review of data from PAH trials prompted our interest in the applicability of the pharmacology of Nrf2 activators, particularly their mitochondrial and anti-inflammatory effects, to PAH.  
 Post-hoc analysis from BEACON in patients with Stage 4 diabetic CKD identified two major risk factors as predictors of fluid overload events: prior hospitalization for heart failure and baseline elevation in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a clinical chemistry measure of fluid status.  Bard-treated patients that experienced heart failure events in BEACON had mean BNP values at baseline, and before receiving study drug, of approximately 550 pg/mL.  Normal BNP levels are less than 100 pg/mL, suggesting many of the patients with fluid overload were in heart failure prior to randomization.  Patients without these risk factors showed no imbalance in heart failure events or mortality, which is consistent with the Phase 2 trials conducted by us that primarily enrolled in patients with Stage 3 diabetic CKD and did not show a risk of fluid overload.  There were no other significant adverse safety findings from the BEACON trial, and patients in the treatment arm had fewer kidney and liver-related SAEs than patients in the placebo arm.
 Safety Experience Using Risk Mitigation Plan and Results of TSUBAKI Trial
 Based on these findings, we resumed clinical development of Bard, excluding at-risk patients by using these identified risk factors and closely monitoring trial participants for signs and symptoms of fluid retention during the first few weeks after treatment initiation.  Risk mitigation features have been implemented in all clinical trials of Bard 
 18

in CKD patients including CARDINAL, our global Phase 2/3 study of patients with Alport syndrome, and PHOENIX, a study in patients with CKD due to FSGS, T1D CKD, IgAN, or ADPKD.  We have also implemented risk mitigation procedures in CATALYST, our global Phase 3 study of patients with CTD-PAH, and LARIAT, our Phase 2 study of patients with PAH.  The risk mitigation strategies adopted for Bard are similar to those adopted by developers of ERAs. For example, the inclusion/exclusion criteria for trials studying AbbVie’s ERA atrasentan and Retrophin’s ERA/ARB drug sparsentan utilize a patient’s prior history of heart failure, current heart failure, and elevated BNP as key components of their exclusion criteria.
 Our licensee, KHK, implemented risk mitigation features in TSUBAKI, their clinical study of Bard in patients with Stage 3 and 4 diabetic CKD in Japan.  TSUBAKI used the risk mitigation plan to exclude patients at risk for fluid retention and carefully monitored cardiac status.  Results from TSUBAKI demonstrated that Bard was not associated with any evidence of cardiotoxicity, based on assessments of serial measurements of troponin T and cardiac function by echocardiography.  Moreover, while eGFR improved, there were no associated changes in blood pressure or other signs of overt volume retention.  Further, urine volume and sodium excretion were unchanged relative to placebo patients.  The trends observed in safety parameters were similar between patients with Stage 3 and 4 diabetic CKD and there were no fluid overload hospitalizations reported in the study.  Thus, data from TSUBAKI demonstrate that by prospectively enrolling patients who were not at risk for fluid retention, Bard appeared well-tolerated in patients with Stages 3 and 4 diabetic CKD.
 To date, none of these studies has shown an increased risk for acute fluid overload AEs with Bard treatment.  The absence of overt fluid overload or subclinical measures of heart failure, including meaningful increases in blood pressure, BNP, or body weight, in these studies demonstrate that prospectively enrolling patients who are not at risk for heart failure may mitigate the risk for fluid retention with Bard previously seen in patients with late-stage diabetic CKD.
 AYAME Trial in Diabetic CKD Conducted by KHK
 Upon completion of TSUBAKI and successful discussions with the Japanese PMDA, KHK finalized the design of a Phase 3 outcomes trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease, which is named AYAME.  This trial is being conducted in Japan and is enrolling patients with Stage 3 or 4 diabetic CKD.  This trial uses the same risk mitigation strategy to avoid overt fluid retention that was used in TSUBAKI.  The primary endpoint is time to onset of a ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESKD.  The trial is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.
 Omav for the Treatment of Neuromuscular Diseases
 In addition to our CKD development programs, we are conducting a registrational Phase 2 clinical trial, part 2 of MOXIe, studying our second Nrf2 activator, Omav, in patients with a rare neuromuscular disorder called FA.  Neuromuscular diseases are commonly driven by mitochondrial dysfunction that impairs ATP production, due to the high energy demand of the nervous system.  Impaired ATP production likely accounts for the decreased coordination, progressive muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in patients with FA, as well as other disease manifestations.  All components of the neuromuscular system, including muscle, the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and the brain, can be affected.  These diseases include ataxias, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and many others.  These diseases can strike as early as infancy, and symptoms can include poor growth, loss of muscle coordination, muscle weakness, visual problems, hearing problems, learning disabilities, neurological problems, autonomic dysfunction, and dementia. 
 Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of many neuromuscular diseases, we believe Omav may be broadly applicable to treat neuromuscular diseases by activating Nrf2 to normalize and improve mitochondrial function and ATP production.  In preclinical models, Omav reduced seizure frequency in refractory, progressive epilepsy models and restored mitochondrial function in biopsy samples from FA, ALS, and familial Parkinson’s disease patients.  Omav has also been shown in vitro to restore mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts isolated from FA patients.  In clinical trials, improvements in neuromuscular function have been observed in FA patients treated with Omav as assessed by mFARS rating scale, and improvements in mitochondrial function, as measured by reductions in blood lactate and heart rate, have been observed in patients with primary mitochondrial disease.  Accordingly, we believe that Omav has the potential to treat a number of neuromuscular diseases with few or no effective therapies.

Omav Development Program for the Treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia
 Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an inherited, life-shortening, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which is normally diagnosed during adolescence and is caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene.  A mutation in the frataxin gene leads to impaired transcription and reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin.  Deficiency of frataxin in cells leads to mitochondrial iron overload and poor cellular iron regulation, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial ATP production.  Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation and wheelchair reliance.  FA patients may also experience visual impairment, hearing loss, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy.  
 FA is usually diagnosed by genetic testing, with approximately 75% of people with FA diagnosed between six and 20 years of age.  Childhood-onset FA can occur as early as age five, is more common than later-onset FA, and normally involves more rapid disease progression.  Most FA patients have disease onset by approximately 13 to 15 years of age, and thereafter, have a mean duration until wheelchair use of 10 to 15 years.  The mean age of death for FA patients is 35 years.  Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  Patients are usually given guidelines for certain lifestyle habits and are recommended to follow a diet that is low in iron and encouraged to take vitamins and supplements.  
 Rationale for Omav in FA
 Because impaired ATP production in FA patients likely accounts for the decreased coordination, progressive muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in these patients, as well as other disease manifestations, we believe that Omav may be effective in treating this indication.  In FA patients, mitochondrial function is correlated with measures of neurologic function.  Further, data demonstrate that Nrf2 signaling is significantly impaired in FA patients, resulting in impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms, while silencing of frataxin gene expression has been linked to decreases in expression of Nrf2.  Additionally, Omav has been shown in vitro to restore mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts isolated from FA patients.  Accordingly, we believe that Nrf2 activation by Omav may result in a clinical benefit to FA patients.
 Clinical Development of Omav in FA
 We are evaluating Omav in MOXIe, a two-part international, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation, registrational Phase 2 trial.  Part 1 of MOXIe evaluated a broad dose range of Omav.  Part 2  of MOXIe is evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single dose level of Omav in FA patients.  We have fully enrolled part 2 of MOXIe across 11 sites in the United States, Europe, and Australia with 103 FA patients, randomized evenly to either Omav or placebo.  The primary endpoint of part 2 of the trial is the change from baseline in mFARS score, a neurological and functional assessment tool, in patients treated with Omav compared to placebo at 48 weeks.  Additional endpoints will include the change from baseline in peak work during maximal exercise testing, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Clinical Global Impression of Change.  The FDA has provided us with written guidance that mFARS score is acceptable as the primary endpoint for part 2 of MOXIe and may consider either accelerated or full approval based on the overall results of the trial and strength of the data.  All patients who complete the treatment period are eligible to continue in the MOXIe trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of Omav.  Those patients who had been receiving placebo will be converted to Omav.  
 20

Part 2 of MOXIe, the registrational portion of the trial, was designed and powered based on data from part 1 of MOXIe.  In part 1 of MOXIe, all dose groups had small sample sizes and were not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.  Data from part 1 demonstrated that the maximum effect on mFARS scores was observed at the 160-mg dose level administered to a total of 12 patients for 12 weeks.  At the 160-mg dose, Omav treatment produced a statistically significant improvement in mFARS scores of 3.8 points versus baseline (p=0.0001) and of 2.3 points relative to placebo (which approached statistical significance, p=0.06).  We also observed that Omav produced greater improvements in mFARS scores in patients that did not have a preexisting musculoskeletal foot deformity that causes high arched feet, called pes cavus.  Excluding pes cavus patients, at the 160-mg dose, Omav treatment produced a statistically significant improvement in mFARS scores of 6.0 points versus baseline (p<0.0001) and of 4.4 points relative to placebo (p=0.01).  The observed improvement in mFARS scores for the seven placebo patients without pes cavus of 1.6 points was similar to that observed in all 17 placebo patients of 1.4 points.  Data from the 160-mg dose are shown in the graph below.  No safety concerns were identified by the DSMB in part 1 of MOXIe and only two SAEs were reported, with both events occurring in placebo-treated patients.  The most common AEs in excess to placebo in the Omav group were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis, which were generally mild in severity.

mFARS Improved with 160-mg Dose


Based on results from part 1 of MOXIe, Phase 3 modeling1 limits pes cavus patients to 20% of the sample size for the trial and assumes minimal effect in patients with pes cavus.  An increase of 4.4 points in 80% of the population and minimal effect in pes cavus patients would suggest a potential placebo-corrected improvement of 3.5 points in mFARS.  The MOXIe registrational trial is conservatively powered to detect a placebo-corrected improvement in mFARS scores of 1.2 (p<0.05) to 1.7 (p<0.01).  
 
1Modeled changes are not intended as a forecast of probable results.  No assurance is given about the results that will be obtained.
 21

We expect to complete part 2 of MOXIe and have top-line data available in the second half of 2019.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Omav for the treatment of FA.  The trial is being overseen by a DSMB that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis, to assess safety.  The DSMB has not reported any safety concerns to date.  If successful, we believe the results from the registrational portion of MOXIe, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval for Omav in the United States. 
Market Opportunity for Omav in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an ultra-orphan disease with a prevalence ranging from 0.7 to 5 per 100,000 in Caucasians globally.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 22,000 people globally with FA, including 6,000 in the United States.  Approximately 2,700 worldwide patients are identified on the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance’s registry, including approximately 1,500 in the United States
.  FA impacts children and young adults, leading to wheelchair use and severely shortened life expectancy.  Although there is no approved therapy, treatment for FA patients is concentrated in 21 neurology ataxia centers.  
 Patients with FA are often undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed with a different cerebellar ataxia, and sometimes correct diagnosis may take years.  Omav has the potential to be the first therapy for the treatment of FA, and, if approved and marketed, more patients may be diagnosed earlier for treatment to preserve or improve neurologic function measured by mFARS scores.  
 Commercial and Manufacturing Preparations for Omav in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 We are in the process of preparing for a potential commercial launch of Omav in FA in the United States.  Our ability to launch Omav is dependent on a successful outcome of MOXIe, the successful filing and defense of an NDA, and approval by the FDA.  We have hired commercial and medical affairs leadership and are building the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for the launch of Omav in the United States, including in sales, marketing, market access, patient support, medical affairs, distribution, quality, compliance, and other areas.
 If we receive approval for Omav in FA, we plan to utilize a specialty pharmacy distribution model to support product availability to patients, with a patient-centered hub to support on-label utilization, ease of access, and patient education and compliance.  We have completed preliminary field force sizing and structure for sales and access teams.  The trade naming process is underway.  We have launched disease awareness campaigns to educate physicians about FA. 
 Manufacturing and quality teams are in place for the current stage of program development with plans to grow as needed to support commercial supply and distribution.  We are on track for planned NDA and commercial launch drug supplies, with an identified supply chain to adequately support near-term clinical and commercial demand.  We have completed registration batches for drug substance and drug product.  A three-year, room temperature, shelf life has been established for clinical-image Omav capsules at the target commercial dose.  In addition, our synthesis from regulatory starting material to drug substance results in a reasonable cost of goods. 
 In addition to our efforts in the United States, we are refining our strategy and market assessments with respect to a potential launch in the EU. We also plan to continue to evaluate market opportunities for Omav in FA in other global markets.
 Bard Development Program for the Treatment of CTD-PAH
 Connective Tissue Disease Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 CTD-PAH is a late and often fatal manifestation of many types of autoimmune disease, including systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and others.  CTD-PAH is a subset of PAH, which results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately leading to right ventricular heart failure and death.  Female PAH patients outnumber males by a factor of two to one, and the onset of PAH generally occurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with the average age of onset being 53.  In comparison to patients with I-PAH, CTD-PAH patients generally have a worse prognosis and experience a higher occurrence of small vessel fibrosis and pulmonary veno-obstructive diseases.  CTD-PAH represents approximately 30% of the overall PAH population and approximately 10-15% of patients with scleroderma or lupus erythematosus.  In the United States, the five-year survival rate for CTD-PAH patients is approximately 44% compared to I-PAH patients, who have a 68% five-year survival rate.
 22

PAH is a systemic disease affecting tissues beyond the cardiopulmonary system.  Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to metabolic dysfunction, which promotes bioenergetic deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction.  The resulting reduction in glucose uptake, lipid oxidation, and cellular energy production translate to dyspnea, fatigue, and impaired functional activity in PAH patients despite optimal vasodilator therapy.  Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been connected with a phenotype in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells that may accelerate disease progression in PAH.  Mitochondrial dysfunction in PAH patients is characterized by, not only decreased Nrf2 activity, but also increased NF-kB activity.
 Three classes of drugs are currently used to treat all etiologies of PAH: ERAs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and prostacyclins.  These agents are all systemic vasodilators that do not address the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in PAH.  Furthermore, their systemic hemodynamic effects can result in hypotension and syncope, or fainting, headache, flushing, and jaw pain, which generally limit their clinical effectiveness and can be exacerbated by clinically significant drug-drug interactions when used in combination. 
 In comparison to patients with I-PAH, CTD-PAH patients are generally less responsive to existing therapies; therefore, vasodilators approved for PAH generally do not yield as significant functional improvements in CTD-PAH patients.  A meta-analysis of 11 registrational trials comprised of more than 2,700 PAH patients demonstrated that CTD-PAH patients benefit less from vasodilator therapies than I-PAH patients when measured by clinical worsening and improvements in 6MWD, with a response in CTD-PAH patients (9.6 meters) of approximately one-third of the response in I-PAH patients (30 meters).  Therefore, vasodilators provide a poor risk-benefit for CTD-PAH patients given minimal treatment effect and AEs.
 Rationale for Bard in CTD-PAH
 Bard directly targets the bioenergetic and inflammatory components of PAH.  PAH patients experience mitochondrial dysfunction, increased NF-kB activity, and related inflammatory pathways involved in ROS-mediated signaling, cellular proliferation, and fibrosis.  Bard, through the combined effect of Nrf2 activation and NF-kB suppression, has the potential to inhibit inflammatory and proliferative signaling, suppress ROS production and signaling, reduce the production of proteins related to fibrosis and tissue remodeling, and increase cellular respiration and ATP production.  Bard targets multiple cell types relevant to PAH, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages.  Additionally, unlike current therapies, Bard does not cause systemic hemodynamic effects or drug-drug interactions in PAH patients.  Therefore, by addressing a novel pathway in PAH, we believe that Bard may provide additional benefits beyond current PAH therapies, including increased functional capacity, effects beyond functional improvements, broader applicability, and as a combination therapy.
 Clinical Development for Bard in CTD-PAH
 We are conducting CATALYST, a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial examining the safety and efficacy of Bard in patients with CTD-PAH when added to standard-of-care vasodilator therapy.  Patients will be on up to two background therapies and will be randomized evenly to either Bard or placebo, and the study drug will be administered once daily for 24 weeks.  Patients randomized to Bard will start at 5 mg and will dose-escalate to 10 mg at Week 4 unless contraindicated clinically.  Based on discussion with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 6MWD relative to placebo at Week 24.  The trial is conservatively powered to enroll approximately 200 patients, and all patients who complete the treatment period are eligible to continue into an extension trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of Bard.  Those patients who had been receiving placebo will be converted to Bard in the extension trial.  
 23

CATALYST was designed based on data from LARIAT, a Phase 2 trial in PAH.  The primary endpoint in CATALYST, which will be analyzed using the mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) statistical analysis method, is the placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from baseline to the end-of-treatment at 24 weeks.  As part of the planning to determine sample size for CATALYST, we performed an analysis applying the MMRM statistical analysis method for CATALYST to the available end-of-treatment change in 6MWD data from CTD-PAH patients in LARIAT.  The LARIAT end-of-treatment analysis at Week 16 shows placebo-corrected change in 6MWD of 48.5 m (p=0.005) in patients without anemia and 21 m (p=0.037) in initial cohorts at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg.  A clinically meaningful improvement of 28.4 m (p=0.07) was observed across all patients.  The summary of our analysis using the change at the end of the treatment period on all patients and patients without anemia is shown in the table below.
 
 
Dataset | Treatment | N | Time-Averaged ∆6MWD (m) | Week 16 ∆6MWD (m)
Change from Baseline | Placebo-corrected | Change from Baseline | Placebo-corrected 
All | Placebo | 7 | 0.6 p=0.96 | - | 9.8 p=0.44 | -
BARD | 15 | 26.7 p<0.001 | 26.1 p=0.06 | 38.2 p<0.001 | 28.4 p=0.07 
Without Anemia | Placebo | 5 | -10.1 p=0.39 | - | -5.8 p=0.68 | -
BARD | 14 | 30.2 p<0.001 | 40.3 p=0.009 | 42.7 p<0.001 | 48.5 p=0.005

 Patients with anemia at baseline demonstrated larger variability and are excluded in CATALYST.  CATALYST is designed to detect a minimum treatment effect of 12.5 meters versus placebo assuming a standard deviation of 50 meters.  The observed treatment effect in the LARIAT CTD-PAH subgroup analyses, both with and without the anemic patients included, is meaningfully larger than the minimally detectable treatment effect in CATALYST.  Overall, Bard was well tolerated in the LARIAT trial.  Among all PAH patients in Part 1, the most common adverse events that were reported with higher incidence in the Bard group compared with the placebo group included dyspnea (12.7% of patients), urinary tract infection (15.5%), decreased appetite (14.1%), and muscle spasm (16.9%).  Among all PAH patients in the placebo-controlled portion of the trial, one serious adverse event of moderate pneumonia was considered by the investigator to be possibly drug related.  After completing 16 weeks of treatment, all patients in LARIAT were eligible to receive Bard in an open-label extension study.  
 Data from CATALYST are expected to be available during the first half of 2020, and, if successful, may support an NDA submission for approval of Bard for the treatment of CTD-PAH. No safety concerns have been reported by the DSMB that oversees the trial and reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis to assess safety.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of PAH. 
 Market Opportunity for Bard in CTD-PAH
 We believe there is significant opportunity for once-daily, orally administered Bard to address, not only the overall PAH market currently served only by the existing vasodilator therapies, but, significantly, CTD-PAH patients who receive limited efficacy and have a more s
evere form of PAH with high morbidity and mortality.  In 2017, global sales of approved PAH treatments were approximately $5.3 billion.  In addition, recently approved treatments such as Opsumit® and Uptravi® have shown rapid uptake in the PAH market and, based on industry reports, are projected to reach between $1 and $2 billion in annual sales within seven years from launch.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 12,000 CTD-PAH patients in the United States and 50,000 worldwide.  
 24

Other Clinical Programs
 In addition to our lead programs, we are currently exploring a battery of additional programs in diseases that may include meaningful expansion opportunities.  Once we have received data on all of our earlier stage programs, we plan to evaluate all data to determine which indications to prioritize and move forward.
 RTA 901 Development Program for the Treatment of Orphan Neurological Indications
 RTA 901 is the lead product candidate from our Hsp90 modulator program.  Our Hsp90 modulators, including RTA 901, are highly potent and selective C-terminal modulators of Hsp90.  Modulation of Hsp90 may induce expression of Hsp70, a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the process through which a protein assumes its functional shape and that serves as a central gatekeeper for mitochondrial protein import.  Mitochondria rely on Hsp70-dependent protein import mechanisms for almost all of their activity, including the production of ATP.  There are also indications that Hsp70 activation may play a profound role in neuroprotection since nerve cells are high consumers of ATP and rely on Hsp70-dependent protein import for proper mitochondrial function.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neural inflammation, and neuropathic pain.  RTA 901, administered orally once-daily, has been observed to rescue existing nerve function, restore thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and improve nerve conductance velocity and mitochondrial function in rodent disease models.  We have completed a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of RTA 901 in healthy adult volunteers.  No safety or tolerability concerns were reported.  We are the exclusive licensee of RTA 901 and have worldwide commercial rights.  
 RORgT Inhibitors
 We are pursuing preclinical development of novel, small-molecule, orally bioavailable RORgT inhibitors.  RORgT is the master regulator of human T Helper 17 (Th17), cellular differentiation, function, and cytokine production, and represents a compelling target for a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.  Th17 cells produce cytokines, including IL-17, that play a critical role in driving immune-mediated inflammation and are implicated in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases.  The efficacy of suppressing IL-17 as a means of treating these conditions has been demonstrated both in animal models and in humans.
 RTA 1701 is the lead product candidate from our proprietary series of RORγt inhibitors for the potential treatment of a broad range of autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases.  RTA 1701 is an orally-bioavailable, RORγt-selective allosteric inhibitor that suppresses Th17 differentiation in vitro and demonstrates strong efficacy in rodent disease models of autoimmune disease.  RTA 1701 also potently suppresses production of IL-17A, a clinically important cytokine, in human immune cells and when dosed orally to non-human primates.  We are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of RTA 1701, administered orally once-daily, in healthy adult volunteers, with initial results expected in the first half of 2019.  We retain all rights to our RORγt inhibitors, which are not subject to any existing commercial collaborations.
 Collaborations
 KHK Agreement
 In December 2009, we entered into an agreement with KHK, under which we provided KHK the right to develop and commercialize Bard for renal, cardiovascular, diabetes, and certain related metabolic indications in Japan, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia.  These indications include, among others, CKD and PAH.  Total consideration under this agreement could reach $272.0 million in upfront and milestone payments, of which we have received $80.0 million.  Additionally, KHK is required to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by KHK, its affiliates, and sublicensees in its territory ranging from the low teens to the low 20% range depending on the country of sale and the amount of annual net sales.
 25

KHK is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all preclinical and clinical activities necessary for the commercialization of licensed products in each country in the licensed territory.  KHK is not participating in the development program for Bard in PAH, ADPKD, or other rare kidney diseases at this time but is reimbursing us the majority of the costs for our registrational trial in CKD caused by Alport syndrome in Japan.  Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply KHK with clinical supply of licensed product required for KHK’s development in the licensed territory, and we are obligated to negotiate and execute commercial supply agreements with KHK.
 The KHK agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all of KHK’s territory.  A royalty term expires in a country on the later of the expiration of all patents in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale in such country.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or uncured material breach.  Additionally, KHK may terminate the agreement at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for KHK’s uncured breach, bankruptcy, or insolvency or by KHK at will, KHK will transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for Bard and will license to us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.
 AbbVie License Agreement
 In September 2010, we entered into a license agreement with AbbVie, under which we provided AbbVie, formerly known as Abbott Pharmaceuticals PR Ltd., the exclusive right to conduct all regulatory activities, including obtaining regulatory approval, and commercialization of Bard or other molecules for renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular indications, including CKD and PAH, in all other countries outside the United States not previously licensed to KHK under the KHK agreement.  Under this agreement, we retain the right to commercialize Bard in the United States.  Also, both parties are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop Bard in accordance with agreed-upon joint development plans.  The aggregate amount of such consideration received through December 31, 2018 totaled $300.0 million in upfront and milestone payments, with a potential $50.0 million milestone related to commercial sales remaining.  Additionally, AbbVie is required to pay us tiered royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees in its territory ranging from 15% to the high 20% range depending on the amount of annual net sales.
 At present, AbbVie has not opted into the development program in CTD-PAH, CKD caused by Alport syndrome, or other rare kidney diseases, and therefore is not co-funding our development programs in these indications.  AbbVie has the right to opt-in to these programs at any time.  Upon opting-in, AbbVie would be required to pay an agreed upon amount of all development costs accumulated up to the point of exercising their opt-in right.  All development costs incurred after AbbVie’s opt-in would be split equally.
 The AbbVie license agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all countries in AbbVie’s territory.  The royalty term expires in a country on the later to occur of (i) the expiration of all patents and regulatory exclusivity, unless prior to such expirations generic sales have exceeded a certain percentage of all sales in a quarter, and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale.  Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety for bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party and in its entirety or with respect to specific territories for an uncured material breach by the other party, and AbbVie may terminate the agreement in its entirety for specified reasons for cause and in its entirety or with respect to specified territories at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for AbbVie’s breach or by AbbVie for cause or at will, AbbVie will license to us certain intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Bard, transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for Bard and will assign or license us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.  Under certain terminations under the AbbVie license agreement, we are also obligated to pay reverse royalties on net sales of Bard in the terminated territory.
 AbbVie Collaboration Agreement
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie under which we provided AbbVie the right to jointly research, develop, and commercialize all second- and later-generation Nrf2 activators for all indications other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications.  This is a multi-molecule, multi-product collaboration across all indications, other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications that are covered in our Bard license agreement with AbbVie and our agreement with KHK.  Pursuant to the AbbVie collaboration agreement, 
 26

the parties have agreed to spend up to a certain amount in early development costs which include research, preclinical development, and clinical development, with us paying 100% of a certain amount of such costs and the remaining costs being shared equally.  Payments to us under this agreement include a $400.0 million upfront payment received upon execution of the AbbVie collaboration agreement, $1.4 million in shared development costs prior to our continuing development of Omav unilaterally, and potential future payments including development cost reimbursement, profit share, and royalty payments.
 For jointly developed products, all other worldwide costs are split equally and worldwide profits are also split equally except for any product designated for an indication for which Humira®, a drug marketed and sold by AbbVie, has received regulatory approval in the United States, the EU, or Japan, in which case the costs and profits will be shared 70% by AbbVie and 30% by us.  Multiple indications can be developed for a single molecule subject to certain limitations.  Upon conclusion of a Phase 2 trial for a given molecule in a given indication, either party may nominate the molecule as a product candidate, as defined in the agreement specifying the lead indication to advance for a given molecule.
 Jointly developed products are developed under agreed development plans and budgets and both parties are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform their respective obligations under such plans.  With respect to Omav, we are the lead development party and the lead regulatory party globally.  Manufacturing responsibilities during development are allocated between the parties pursuant to the agreed development plans.  AbbVie will serve as the lead manufacturing party for commercial supply in all jointly developed Omav indications.
 With respect to joint development, commercialization territory rights are divided on a molecule-by-molecule basis.  We have the primary right to commercialize Omav in the United States, and AbbVie has the primary right to commercialize Omav in the rest of the world, with exclusive commercialization rights in Japan.  For subsequent product candidates, we retain the rights to at least one major market, although the first choice alternates between the collaboration parties as each new molecule is commercialized.
 Products may be unilaterally developed by a party with the other party being entitled to opt-out of, and back into, development cost sharing and profit sharing at various stages of development.  The developer would serve as the lead development, regulatory, and manufacturing party.  The developer has the right to commercialize in all territories and must pay a royalty to the nonparticipating party ranging from the low single digits to 20%, depending principally on what stage of development, if any, was funded by the nonparticipating party.  In September 2016, we and AbbVie mutually agreed that we would continue unilateral development of Omav.  Therefore, AbbVie no longer co-funds the exploratory development costs of this program but retains the right to opt back in.  Depending upon what point, if any, AbbVie opts back into development, AbbVie may retain its right to commercialize a product outside the United States, or we may be responsible for commercializing the product on a worldwide basis.  Upon opting back in, AbbVie would be required to pay an agreed upon amount of all development costs accumulated up to the point of exercising their opt-in right, after which development costs incurred and product revenue worldwide would be split equally.
 The AbbVie collaboration agreement will continue in effect until both parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement.  Upon any uncured material breach under the AbbVie collaboration agreement with respect to a joint product, the non-breaching party will have the right to continue development of such product at its own cost and maintain all profits from such product unless the breaching party opts-in to continue development and pays a specified opt-in payment.
 
Competition
Bard in Rare Forms of CKD 
 The development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive.  Our future commercial success depends on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage.  We are aware of several advanced drug development programs in the rare forms of CKD for which we are developing Bard.
 27

Bard in CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 Currently, there are no approved therapies for CKD caused by Alport syndrome and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.  If Bard is approved and launched commercially, it will likely be the first treatment on the market in the United States.  We are aware of one therapy, RG-012 (lademirsen), which is in Phase 2 clinical development for male patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.   Additionally, several inhibitors of the sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 protein, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin by Boehringer Ingelheim and Johnson and Johnson, are in development for inflammatory and inherited forms of CKD, and TRC101 is in development for the treatment of CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, a complication which may occur in patients with various forms of CKD including some of the diseases for which we are developing Bard.  
 Bard in ADPKD
 Currently, there is one drug approved and multiple therapies in late stage clinical development for the treatment of ADPKD.  In 2018, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. received approval by the FDA to market tolvaptan (Jynarque®) to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.  Additional therapies reported to be in clinical development include venglustat, which is currently in Phase 2/3 clinical development in ADPKD patients by Sanofi Genzyme, tesevatinib, which is in Phase 2 development by Kadmon Holdings, Inc., and lixivaptan, which is in Phase 2 development by Palladio Biosciences.
 Bard in IgAN
 There are currently no therapies approved for IgAN, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or immunosuppressant therapy.  We are aware of multiple drugs in advanced clinical development for IgAN, including OMS-721, nefecon, and sparsentan, which are in Phase 3 clinical development by Omeros Corporation, Calliditas Therapeutics AB, and Retrophin, Inc., respectively.  Additionally, LNP023, atacicept, and APL-2 are reported to be in Phase 2 clinical development by Novartis AG, Merck KgaA, and Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc., respectively.
 Bard in FSGS
 There are currently no therapies approved for FSGS, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or immunosuppressant therapy.  There are multiple drugs in advanced clinical development for FSGS, including sparsentan, which is in Phase 3 clinical development by Retrophin, Inc., and CCX140, CXA-10, DMX-200, voclosporin, PF-06730512, and abatacept, which are reported to be in Phase 2 clinical development by ChemoCentryx, Inc., Complexa, Inc., Dimerix Bioscience Ltd., Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, respectively.  
 Bard in T1D CKD 
 There are currently no therapies approved to treat T1D CKD, and patients are commonly treated off-label with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.  We are aware of two drugs in advanced clinical development, including empagliflozin, which is in Phase 3 development by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company, and GKT831, which is in Phase 2 clinical development by GenKyoTex SA.
 Omav in FA
If Omav is approved for the treatment of FA, it has the potential to be the first treatment on the market for this indication, but it currently faces pipeline competition.  Pipeline competition for this orphan disease results in competition for patient recruitment as well as investigators’ time and resources.  Several competitor product candidates are in Phase 1 or 2 clinical development for FA, including TAK831, epicatechin, RT001, vatiquinone, and JOT101 from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cardero Therapeutics Inc., Retrotope Inc., BioElectron Technology Corporation, and Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc., respectively.  
 28

Bard in CTD-PAH
 If Bard is approved for the treatment of patients with CTD-PAH for use in conjunction with currently approved therapies for PAH, such as ERAs, prostacyclins, and PDE-5 inhibitors, it will face competition with those current treatments such as macitentan, marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) as Opsumit®; riociguat, marketed by Bayer AG (Bayer) as Adempas®; oral treprostinil, marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation as Orenitram®; ambrisentan, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) as Letairis®; selexipag, marketed by Actelion as Uptravi®; and bosentan, marketed by Actelion as Tracleer®.  Patients with PAH frequently use more than one therapy; however, we may face competition for patients’ willingness and resources to add another clinical therapy.
 We may also face competition from potential new therapies in development.  For example, United Therapeutics Corporation, Gilead, Bial-Portela & Ca., SA, and Karos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are actively developing compounds that are attempting to address a problem outside of vasodilation and are to be used or allow use in combination with existing treatments.  Their products appear to be in early clinical development.  We consider these our most direct competitors.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on multiple third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for planned commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.  We believe there are reliable sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.  Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities.  As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers and continue to strategically build redundancy in suppliers to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, commercial supply needs for ourselves and our collaborators.
Sales and Marketing
 We currently intend to build, and are in the process of building, the commercial infrastructure in the United States necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all of our product candidates if and when regulatory approval of such product candidates in the United States appears imminent.  We are in the process of preparing for a potential commercial launch of Bard in Alport syndrome in the United States.  Our ability to launch Bard is dependent on a successful outcome of the CARDINAL trial, the successful filing and defense of an NDA, and obtaining FDA approval.  We have hired commercial and medical affairs leadership and are building the teams, infrastructure, systems, and processes necessary for launch of Bard in the United States, including sales, marketing, market access, patient support, medical affairs, distribution, quality, compliance, and other areas.
 If we receive approval for Bard in Alport syndrome, we plan to utilize a specialty pharmacy distribution model to support product availability to patients, with a patient-centered hub to support on-label utilization, ease of access, and patient education and compliance.  We have completed preliminary field force sizing and structure for sales and access teams. 
 Commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support.  One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations.  Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases.
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts.  To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved. 
 29

Outside of the United States, where appropriate and depending on the terms of our contractual arrangements, we plan, either alone, with our strategic collaborators AbbVie and KHK, or with new collaboration partners, to commercialize our products.  In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 Government Regulation 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant and sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the DOJ or other governmental entities.
United States Product Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FFDCA.  Pharmaceutical products are also subject to regulation by other governmental agencies, such as the FTC, the OIG of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the EPA, and the DOJ.  The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

• | Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLPs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before any human clinical trial commences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an IRB or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with GCPs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an NDA for the applicable small molecule drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review, and approval of the NDA (including the product labeling and package insert); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with CGMPs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate.  Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs.  The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy determination.  The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the studies as outlined in the IND prior to that time.  In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.  The IND must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
 30

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator.  Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial, and in accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection, and exclusion criteria, and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Progress reports detailing the status of clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.  Sponsors must also report in a timely manner to the FDA SAEs and unexpected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected AEs over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or tests that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate.  Further, the protocol for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.  The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, and the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined and different studies may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or different patient populations.  These phases generally include the following:
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers.  In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for PD and PK properties such as safety (including adverse effects), dosage tolerability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve a limited patient population to (1) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerability and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 trials, the clinical trial program may be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage, and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments.  Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 A pivotal trial is an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial that permits FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for labeling of the drug.  In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) in conjunction with confirmatory evidence.  The FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials as pivotal if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.  This group determines whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.  A clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 31

The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition, and quality of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.  The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, currently approximately $2.6 million for fiscal year 2019.  The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies.
 Review of Application
 Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review.  This is typically 12 months from the date of submission.  The review process is often extended by the FDA as a result of submission of additional information, sometimes at the FDA’s request, during the review.  The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with CGMPs.  The FDA will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy.  During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product.  If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required.  A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval.  The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit, and interpretation of clinical trial data.  The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or the FDA requires additional testing or information.  The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information.  Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.  Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion.  Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.  Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The Orphan Drug Act
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.  During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.  Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits (Credits) for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 32

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity in an indication, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA in what is known as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children.  The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, a sponsor would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA and conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA.  If there is no written agreement, studies would be conducted in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and reports submitted of those studies.  A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health.  The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request, agreement, or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration.  Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.  The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.  The FDA, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, may defer pediatric trial requirements for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations.  A deferral may be granted by the FDA if it believes that additional safety or effectiveness data in the adult population need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.  The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to NDAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.  Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.  The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs.  For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition.  The key benefits of fast track designation are rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval or approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint, if relevant criteria are met.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.  Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 33

Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at eight months after the NDA submission.  Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition.  If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of twelve months after NDA submission.  Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Even after approval, drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuous regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.  There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA.  For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements.  Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.  FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.  Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, untitled and warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market.  Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 34

Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors at the state level.  Under the PDMA and state law, states require the registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals in that state, including in certain states manufacturers and distributors that ship pharmaceuticals into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state.  The PDMA and state laws impose requirements and limitations upon drug sampling to ensure accountability in the distribution of samples.  The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of these and other provisions.
 The DSCSA, signed in to law on November 27, 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, identification, verification, and other elements.  Among the requirements of this federal legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier (i.e., serialization) in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.  These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period.  The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations.  The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers.  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA.  Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry.  These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to certain arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection.  Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.  The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the PPACA to a lower intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.  In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or 
 35

fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).  Further, civil monetary penalties statutes impose penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government.  Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product.  Other pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services.  Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to the CMS, related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  This information is made publicly available on a searchable website. Effective January 2022, information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also need to be reported.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials.  Other states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.  Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging.  In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, 
 36

civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.  Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.  Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.
 Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.  Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors.  These third-party payors are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.  In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates.  The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.  The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 Because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unpredictable process.  We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.  This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results.  We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective.  Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor-by-payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor.  If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them.  This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU and China, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.  In some non- United States jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of a company placing the medicinal product on the market.  We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products.  In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 37

Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products.  In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change.  Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform healthcare coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts.  We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals, limitations on rebate payments by drug manufacturers, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.  Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.  For example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law.  Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.  The PPACA also expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, created a new Medicare Part D discount program, expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Services Pharmaceutical pricing program, and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.  In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, or which could otherwise affect our commercial operations and ability to be profitable.  If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts.  Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible.  More recently, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law, which eliminated certain requirements of the PPACA, including the individual mandate, and the current administration has further suggested that it may seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA.  There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
 In addition, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted and created measures for spending reductions by Congress.  A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs.  These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013.  These reductions have been extended through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken.  Also, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed in to law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers.
 Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the effect of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor, or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures.  Such policy actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, contains a number of provisions related to the development of drug and biological products, including provisions intended to encourage the 
 38

modernization of clinical trial design and support broader use of tools like biomarkers and methods to collect patient experience data.  While the 21st Century Cures Act is intended to make drug and biological product development less time-consuming and less costly, it does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality or quantity of evidence necessary to support approval.  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2017 reauthorized and amended several drug provisions that were scheduled to sunset, such as the prescription drug user fee provisions, and made other changes to the FFDCA, including provisions related to development of pediatric drugs and access to generic drugs.  In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies, or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
 Foreign Regulation
 We are planning on seeking approval for our product candidates in Europe, Japan, and other countries.  To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy that govern, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.  Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of other countries in which we may seek approval, the approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve different amounts of product testing and additional administrative review periods.  For example, in Europe, a sponsor must submit a CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.  A CTA must be submitted to each national health authority and an independent ethics committee.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as the countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.  The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from or be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval.  Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory approval process in other countries.
 Our clinical trial programs and research collaborations may implicate international data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018 and governs the collections and use of personal data in the EU.  The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, data breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations.  
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an initial IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA and the approval of that product candidate application.  Patent term restoration cannot, however, extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date.  In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration.  In the future, we expect to apply for restoration of patent term for patents relating to each of our product candidates to add patent life beyond the current expiration date of such patents, depending on the length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 39

Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA.  For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of exclusivity to any approved NDA for a product containing a NCE, never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination with another active moiety.  No application or ANDA, that references the NDA for the NCE may be submitted during the five-year exclusivity period, except that such applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of the patents listed with the FDA for the innovator NDA.
 Foreign Country Data Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for additional market exclusivity.  For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, an NCE generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity.  If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application.  During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including patents claiming compositions of matter, therapeutic uses, distinct forms of specific compounds, formulations, manufacturing methods, and uses in specific indications and patient populations.  We are actively engaged in research to further develop and maintain our competitive position, and may rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuous technological innovation to support and enhance our competitive position.
 We seek to protect and strengthen our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technologies, inventions, and any improvements that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims.  Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, or processes.  Additionally, any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed.  We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights or proprietary position will be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide or protect competitive advantages.  Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our technologies, business model, or strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 Our patent estate (patents and patent applications owned by or exclusively licensed to Reata and one family of patent applications owned by AbbVie and contractually available for Reata’s use), on a worldwide basis, encompasses more than 240 granted patents and more than 280 pending patent applications, including more than 140 granted patents and more than 150 pending patent applications related to Bard, Omav, RTA 901, and RTA 1701.  More than 60 granted patents and more than 100 pending applications claim additional structural classes of Nrf2 activators, providing further protection for the franchise and a potential source of additional development candidates.  Two issued United States patents, more than five issued foreign patents, two pending United States patent applications, and a number of pending foreign patent applications contain composition of matter claims to RTA 901 and related compounds.  RTA 1701 is covered by more than 20 granted United States and foreign patents and a number of pending applications.
 40

Our later-expiring granted patents with claims to compositions of matter for Bard, including patents claiming the commercial form, have an expiration date of 2029 in the United States and 2028 elsewhere.  The patent that covers specific formulations of Bard, including the commercial formulation, has an expiration date of 2030.  Other granted patents and pending patent applications relating to specific uses of Bard, including the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH), PAH, and CKD, have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2034.  Fundamental composition of matter patents and applications claiming Omav have an expiration date in 2033.  These patents and applications also contain claims to therapeutic uses of Omav.  The fundamental United States composition of matter patent claiming RTA 901, and its foreign equivalents, have an expiration date in 2033.  Patents and pending applications covering RTA 1701, including composition of matter claims and method of use claims, have expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2037.
 The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term, availability of legal remedies in the particular territory in which the patent is granted, and success of any challenges to the patent, if asserted.  Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted.  We have in the past been involved in various administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future.  Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable.  In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of proceedings and experts’ fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.
 Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent.
 The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 Bard Patent Portfolio
 Our Bard patent portfolio includes six families of granted United States patents, some with related applications pending, and two additional families of pending United States patent applications.  Granted and pending claims offer various forms of protection for Bard including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific forms (such as crystalline or non-crystalline forms), specific formulations, and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including PAH and CKD, using Bard or its analogs.  These United States patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 There are two families of composition of matter patents containing claims that cover Bard.  The original patent family containing claims to Bard and related compounds was filed in 1999 and exclusively licensed to Reata in 2004 (see “Business—Intellectual Property—Licenses”).  Exclusive of any patent term extension, one granted United States patent from this family containing claims covering Bard has an expiration date in 2022.  Corresponding patents granted in Canada, Europe (validated in multiple European Patent Convention (EPC) member states), and Japan have expiration dates in 2019.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, the granted United States patents containing claims covering specific forms of Bard, including the commercial form, are due to expire in 2028 or 2029.  Two corresponding regional patents have been granted in Europe and each is validated in multiple EPC member states.  Additional corresponding patents have been granted in Japan, China, Canada, and several other countries, and related applications 
 41

provide broad international protection in additional territories worldwide.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, these granted foreign patents and pending patent applications, if granted, are due to expire in 2028.
 In some cases, granted United States patents claiming Bard have a longer statutory term than the corresponding foreign patents.  This results from the USPTO’s practice of granting patent term adjustments for examination delays originating at the USPTO.  Such adjustments are generally not available under foreign patent laws.  If Bard is approved for marketing in the United States, under the Hatch-Waxman Act we may be eligible for up to five years patent term extension for a granted United States patent containing claims covering Bard.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We also own or exclusively license various United States and foreign granted patents and pending patent applications containing claims covering formulations of Bard, including the planned commercial formulation, and methods of using Bard for the treatment of multiple diseases including PH, PAH, endothelial dysfunction (an essential component of many cardiovascular disorders including PAH), cardiovascular disease, CKD, Alport syndrome, metabolic disorders, and obesity.
 The most relevant granted United States patents with composition of matter or method of use claims covering Bard are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension.

Omav Patent Portfolio
 Omav is protected by three families of patents.  The first, filed in April 2009, contains composition of matter claims that encompass Omav and many related compounds.  This family includes five issued United States patents and a number of granted patents in foreign jurisdictions including China, Mexico, and Japan.  Additional United States and foreign applications from this family are pending.  The second family, filed in April 2013, is specifically focused on Omav and includes composition of matter claims and method of use claims.  The initial United States patent from this family was issued on March 31, 2015.  The issued claims include composition of matter claims to Omav without regard to morphic form, claims to several distinct morphic forms of Omav, including the form used in oral dosing formulations, and claims to various methods of therapeutic use.  A first continuation application has also issued, and a second continuation application is pending.  Foreign equivalents of the original United States application have been filed in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and more than 20 other territories.  The European application has granted and has been validated in multiple EPC member states.  In addition, a divisional application has been filed in Europe.  The Japanese and Chinese applications have also granted.  A third patent family, filed by AbbVie in April 2014 and subject to the terms of the AbbVie collaboration agreement, claims additional morphic forms of Omav.
 42

The most relevant granted United States patents with claims covering Omav are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates.  As discussed above for Bard, if Omav is approved for marketing in the United States, we may be eligible for term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a granted United States patent containing claims covering Omav.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”

 RTA 901 is protected by a family of patents and applications based on a PCT application filed in 2013.  Patents from this family have been granted in the United States, Australia, China, Eurasia, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand.  Applications are pending in Europe, Canada, Mexico, and several other countries.  A first United States continuation application has also issued, and a second United States continuation application is pending.  Both issued and pending claims in this family include composition of matter claims that specifically cover RTA 901 regardless of form, and other claims that cover related compounds.  Patents from this family will expire in 2033 unless extended.  Details of the issued United States patent are shown below.

Trade Secrets and Know-How
 Certain aspects of our activities, such as our research and manufacturing efforts, rely in part on proprietary know-how or trade secrets.  Because we may employ third-party contractors to conduct certain aspects of those activities and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our technology platform, we must at times share trade secrets with them.  We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements, or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information.  These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets.  Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.  Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

Licenses
 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System in which we obtained from the Trustees of Dartmouth College (Dartmouth) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson), an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to compounds, including Bard, and claims in certain patents and patent applications, along with associated know-how, to manufacture, have manufactured, use and sell defined licensed products for use within the field of human therapeutic and diagnostic uses, research reagents, and veterinary uses.  Dartmouth and MD Anderson retain certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government retains certain limited rights.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid an initial licensing fee and sunk-in patent costs and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees.  In addition, the license requires us to make certain development milestone payments depending on the licensed indication, a portion of sublicensing revenue received by us from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at percentages between mid-teen digits and low-single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees subject to specified annual minimums.  To date, we have made $26.7 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 We have a continuing obligation to use best efforts to commercialize the licensed technology.  The license is effective until the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product or 20 years if no licensed patent covers the licensed product.  The license can be terminated by the licensors for our material breach subject to a specified notice and cure period based on the nature of the breach, if we become insolvent or enter bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, if we fail to provide satisfactory evidence that we are exercising best efforts to commercialize a licensed invention, or if two payments are late or unpaid within a twelve-month period.  Upon any termination of the license, we grant licensors a non-exclusive, sublicenseable license to any improvements that we make to the licensed technology, including those that we license from third parties, subject to a mutually agreed royalty.
 2012 Amendment to the 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the 2004 license.  This amendment provides, among other terms, that we will pay to the licensors a certain amount from the next one or more milestone payments received by us under the AbbVie license agreement and a low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain Nrf2 activator compounds under the AbbVie collaboration agreement, including Omav, that are claimed in certain patents and patent applications that are wholly owned by or assigned to us as identified in the AbbVie collaboration agreement.
 2009 Dartmouth License
 In 2009, we entered into an agreement with Dartmouth, pursuant to which Dartmouth granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license to Dartmouth’s rights in patents and patent applications jointly owned by us and Dartmouth claiming the use of Bard and related compounds in the treatment of renal, cardiovascular, and certain metabolic diseases, along with associated know-how, to make, have made, use and sell defined licensed products in the licensed field.  Dartmouth retains certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid to Dartmouth an initial licensing fee and we are required to pay annual maintenance fees and payments associated with the achievement of certain development and aggregate sales milestones.  In addition, Dartmouth is entitled to receive from us a portion of our sublicensing revenue from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage in the low single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees.  In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the license, which provides, among other terms, that we pay to Dartmouth a sublicensing fee in connection with a specified milestone under the AbbVie license agreement.  To date, we have made $10.8 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 44

We are obligated to exert commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize and effectively manufacture and market licensed products, including, targeting certain development milestones specified in the agreement.
 The license is effective until the last valid claim of the licensed patents in the territory expires.  Each party has the right to terminate the license for the other party’s material breach, subject to a specified notice and cure period.  The license terminates automatically in the event that we become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file for bankruptcy.
 2014 University of Kansas Licenses
 In September 2014, we entered into two exclusive, worldwide license agreements with KU Center for Technology Commercialization, Inc., the manager of intellectual property owned by University of Kansas and the University of Kansas Medical Center (the University of Kansas), to compounds claimed in certain patents and patent applications either owned exclusively by the University of Kansas or owned jointly by the University of Kansas and the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) that act as small molecule modulators of heat shock protein activity and responses in all human and veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic uses.
 Under the terms of these licenses, we paid the University of Kansas initial licensing fees and reimbursed University of Kansas for past patent expenses incurred.  Under each agreement, we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, are obligated to spend a specified threshold for sponsored research to be performed by the University of Kansas and are obligated to pay University of Kansas development and regulatory milestone payments for each of the first two products and sales milestone payments only on the first product developed.  Under each agreement the University of Kansas is entitled to receive from us a portion of any sublicensing revenue we receive from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage ranging from the low single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is granted.  Under each agreement, the University of Kansas is entitled to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees at a percentage ranging in the low single digits depending on the type of licensed product, subject to minimum annual royalties.  To date, we have made $0.7 million in development and sublicense payments under these licenses.  Under each license agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and market at least one licensed compound.  Additionally, under each license agreement, the University of Kansas retains limited rights related to research and educational use of these compounds, and the United States government also retains certain limited rights related to these compounds arising from federal funding of the research that led to their discovery.  Under one agreement, the NIH retains limited rights related to research and educational use of compounds claimed in patents that name NIH as an assignee.
 Each license agreement is effective on a per-country basis until the later of: (i) the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product in such country; (ii) ten years from first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country; or (iii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product that bars the entry of generic competitors in such country.
 Each license agreement can be terminated by the University of Kansas if we fail to make required payments or reports, fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize a licensed product, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, enter into receivership or a composition with creditors, or fail to perform certain other obligations including the achievement of certain developmental milestones within specified time limits, and we fail to cure any such breach within 30 days of receiving a notice of default from the licensors.
 Third-Party Filings
 A number of United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products.  Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that, if granted, could pose an infringement risk with respect to our use of our product candidates or proprietary technologies.
 45

If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including but not limited to litigation expenses, substantial damages, attorney fees, injunction, royalty payments, cross-licensing of our patents, redesign of our products or processes, and related fees and costs.
 We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products, product candidates, and proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights.  If one of these patents were to be found to cover our products, product candidates, proprietary technologies, or their uses, we could be required to pay damages and could be restricted from commercializing our products, product candidates, or using our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license to the patent.  A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.  In addition, during litigation, the patent holder might obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies, or methods.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 123 full-time employees, 27 of whom held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 80 of whom were engaged in research and development, and 43 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support.  None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and none of our employees has entered into a collective agreement with us.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
Facilities
 Our principal executive offices are located in Irving, Texas, where we lease approximately 34,890 square feet of office and laboratory space.  Our lease expires in October 2020.  We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.
