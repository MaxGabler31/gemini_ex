--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a global, technology-enabled animal health business with a comprehensive service and technology platform and supply chain infrastructure dedicated to supporting the companion, equine and large animal veterinary markets. We have combined the complementary capabilities of the animal health businesses previously operated by Henry Schein, Inc., or the Animal Health Business, and Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a Vets First Choice), or Vets First Choice, bringing together leading practice management software and supply chain businesses with a platform approach based on technology-driven insights, designed to promote connectivity between veterinarians and owners of pets, horses or large animals who purchase products or services from veterinarians, whom we refer to as Clients. Linking the power of insight and analytics, client engagement, practice management software and supply chain expertise into a multi-channel platform, we believe our innovative approach will support the delivery of improved veterinary care while driving increased demand for our products and services. 
 We have a talented team of over 5,000 employees positioned to support veterinarians evolving practice needs with an expanded offering that we believe enhances the Client experience and improves medical and service compliance. In addition, we seek to improve veterinary practice economics by helping veterinarians identify and manage gaps in care through proactive prescription management, inventory management and supply chain expertise, specialty pharmacy services, innovative solutions to chronic care disease management, veterinary practice management software and client communication tools. Further, as a global company focused solely on animal health with a multi-channel strategy, we seek to leverage our decades-long experience within the veterinary channel with a differentiated value proposition by increasing innovation, providing a more comprehensive set of integrated services, improving the experience and engagement of Clients and of the people and entities that purchase products and services from us, whom we refer to as Customers, and driving cost-effectiveness through efficient delivery of next-generation solutions. 
 By bringing the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice together into one company, we expect to enhance our growth opportunities with our large base of established Customers and Clients and secure new business. We believe the combination of our capabilities serves as a foundation for incremental revenue growth and operational synergies. Pro forma, combined net sales in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 were approximately $4.0 billion. 
 History and Corporate Information 
 On February 7, 2019, we announced that we had consummated the previously disclosed Reverse Morris Trust transaction contemplated by (a) the Contribution and Distribution Agreement, dated as of April 20, 2018, as amended, or the Contribution and Distribution Agreement, by and among us, Henry Schein, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to herein as Henry Schein or the Parent, our parent prior to the Distribution (as defined below), Vets First Choice, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the Vets First Choice stockholders and for the purposes of certain articles set forth therein, or the Vets First Choice Stockholders Representative and (b) the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2018, as amended, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, Henry Schein, HS Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, Vets First Choice and the Vets First Choice Stockholders Representative. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement and the Merger Agreement, (i) prior to February 7, 2019, Henry Schein contributed the Animal Health Business to us, which we refer to as the Reorganization, (ii) on February 7, 2019, Henry Schein distributed all of the shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Common Stock, that were then owned by Henry Schein (after giving effect to the Share Sale discussed below) to Henry Schein stockholders

  built into the veterinary practice management software workflow, leverages insight and analytics, client engagement services and integrated pharmacy services, and is designed to improve medical compliance via proactive prescription management. By working directly with veterinary practices to manage gaps in care, we seek to enable our veterinarian Customers to create new revenue opportunities, adapt to changing companion animal or horse owner, or Pet Owner, purchasing behaviors, enhance their Client relationships and improve the quality of care they provide. 
 Veterinary Supply Chain 
 We are a leader in supply chain expertise in the animal health industry. We distribute products from over 50 distribution centers, including 16 North American distribution centers, 23 distribution centers in Europe and 10 distribution centers in Australasia. 
 We strive to provide veterinarians access to all products they need to operate a successful veterinary practice. We carry a wide portfolio of products sourced from both global and regional suppliers to ensure that our commitment to prompt product availability can be fulfilled whenever and wherever our Customer base requires. The Animal Health Business derived approximately 16% of its net sales for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and 15% of its net sales in each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 from the sale of proprietary brands. 
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products for enhancing practice revenue, operating efficient practices and delivering high-quality care. We sell and distribute pharmaceuticals, nutrition products, consumable products, diagnostic tests, small and large equipment, laboratory products and surgical products, among others. For each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, approximately 70% of the Animal Health Business revenue was derived from the sales of pharmaceuticals and nutrition products. 
 Pharmaceuticals include vaccines for disease prevention and parasiticides for the control of fleas, ticks and internal and external parasites. Pharmaceutical products are sourced from major global pharmaceutical companies as well as regional companies in some parts of the world. 
 Additionally, we offer a wide range of nutrition products, including food, specialty products to address particular health issues, supplements and premium products for enhanced general diet. These products include those sourced from leading industry supply partners and our proprietary brands. 
 We offer small and large equipment from a variety of equipment suppliers as well as our own proprietary brands. In addition to diagnostic equipment, we provide a wide range of capital equipment to veterinary hospitals, including anesthetic machines, dental carts, imaging machines, cages and tables. 
 Substantially all of the products we distribute are manufactured by third parties and we are dependent on our suppliers for these products. We believe that effective purchasing is a key factor in maintaining our position as a leading provider of animal health products. We regularly assess our purchasing needs and our suppliers product offerings and prices. 
 We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery (typically, next day) and complete order fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our information management systems. Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customers location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment.

 Practice Management Software and Value-Added Solutions and Services 
 We offer our Customers more than just veterinary supplies, serving as an integral partner to our Customers practices for information management solutions and client communications. We offer innovative technology-enabled solutions and services, including practice management software, support, data driven applications and related services. Our practice management solutions provide practitioners with electronic medical records, treatment history, billing, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic claims processing and word processing programs. For example, we support, develop and provide veterinary practices with veterinary software systems, including AVImark, eVetPractice, ImproMed and ImproMed Equine in North America, and Robovet, VisionVPM and RxWorks in the United Kingdom and Australia. Moreover, we offer solutions that integrate with our software platforms, including client communication services such as Vetstreet and Rapport, reminders, data backup services, hardware sales and support and credit card processing. In total, we offer value-added services to our more than 20,000 practice management software Customers worldwide. 
Prescription Management Platform 
 We offer a prescription management platform that empowers veterinarians with insights that are designed to increase Customer engagement and veterinary practice health. The platform, which is built into the veterinary practice management software workflow, leverages insight and analytics, Client engagement services and integrated pharmacy services, and is designed to improve medical compliance via proactive prescription management. By working directly with veterinary practices to manage gaps in care, we seek to enable our veterinarian Customers to create new revenue opportunities, adapt to changing Pet Owner purchasing behaviors, enhance their Client relationships and improve the quality of care they provide. 
 While the global companion animal market is growing, we believe veterinary practices are currently combating pressures tied to the growth of e-commerce and retail competition. Evolving Client purchasing behavior has resulted in product revenue moving outside of the veterinary practice channel, creating financial pressures for veterinary practices that we believe will increase over time. We believe these increasing burdens create an opportunity for our prescription management platform to change veterinarians relationships with their Clients and the fundamental economics of their practices by providing greater insights into medical compliance and managing gaps in care. We believe that redefining how prescription management is delivered can not only help veterinarians recapture and grow their product revenue but also drive in-clinic service activity. 
 Our technology platform encompasses and integrates the core functionality of pharmacy service and prescription and inventory management in a single, secure and regulatory-compliant system. The underlying core of the platform is its real-time integration with veterinary practice management software systems and the ability to normalize and interpret analytics on disparate client records, creating a standardized view to help identify gaps in care in a specific veterinary practice. With this detailed insight organized by Client, therapy and practitioner, veterinarians within the practice can use that information to proactively manage prescription delivery. Our veterinary practice Customers engage on our platform in an effort to improve medical compliance and enhance practice economics while also offering convenient, more affordable, on-demand, high-quality veterinary medicine to their Clients and their pets and horses. The platform offers both the veterinarian Customer and its Client an experience centered on improving medication and service compliance. We believe veterinarians, regardless of geography or specialization, can leverage prescription management and client engagement with our platform. 
 The prescription management platforms business model is aligned with the objectives of our veterinary practice Customers. A significant portion of our platforms revenue is derived from the integrated pharmacy services we offer, based on the number of filled, refilled and renewed prescriptions that our veterinary practice Customers are channeling into the platform marketplace. This pay-for-performance model provides for increased engagement on the platform and drives more Pet Owners to the network as veterinary practices expand and broaden the suite of products made available by our Customers to their Clients on the platform.

 Our integrated prescription management platform solution is designed to position us at the center of the relationship among the veterinarian, Pet Owner and manufacturer and as a key participant in the market for veterinary prescription management services. We regularly incorporate new product features into the platform to meet the evolving needs of our Customers and their Clients and to enhance differentiation, designed to drive revenue for our veterinary practice Customers. Our prescription management platform supports the following capabilities: 
 

 | insight and analytics from internal and external data sources, such as practice management software;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | algorithmic interpretation of data to identify gaps in care by animal, therapy and practitioner;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Our ability to normalize data from disparate sources within the practice management system enables us to incorporate pet, horse and Pet Owner information and clinical insight effectively and to provide individually tailored strategies for them. Our data integration, conversion and support services and solution delivery capabilities provide a single point of integration with more than 20 practice management systems, enabling a growing number of veterinary practice Customers to benefit from the platform. 
 We help veterinarians turn data into actionable insight and effectively integrate this into their workflow. We are able to standardize information, providing timely and useful insights. With gaps in care identified, our platform offers proactive prescription management and integrated pharmacy services designed to drive Client engagement and improve medication and service compliance. We believe this integrated solution offers a multitude of advantages over a piecemeal approach. 
 The configurable nature and broad capabilities of our prescription management platform help enhance the benefits our veterinary practice Customers receive and help increase the effectiveness of our veterinary practice Customers existing practice management software technology architecture. Our solutions are delivered as integral components of our Customers core operations, rather than as add-on solutions, enhancing the overall value proposition we offer. We leverage the platform and centralized resources in conjunction with the growth in our veterinary practice Customers client lists to provide additional functionality and insight. 
 We believe our focus on providing deeper insights into medical compliance and integrating those insights into the veterinarians practice management workflow has created a platform that fundamentally strengthens the economics of the veterinary practices and the veterinarian-client relationship. 
 

 | For the veterinarian, our prescription management platform enables proactive prescription management and integrated pharmacy services, which we believe simultaneously narrows gaps in care and enhances medical compliance, creates in-clinic and online demand, improves practice economics, and provides our veterinary practice Customers a competitive advantage against online and other distributors and strengthens client relationships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For the Client, we believe proactive client engagement improves compliance with therapeutic recommendations, which drives improved health outcomes for their pets and horses, with the platform providing the high-quality, efficient and on-demand access that consumers increasingly demand from their shopping experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For the manufacturer, demand generation from narrowing gaps in care, quality accreditation, drug pedigree and chain of custody support a strengthening relationship with the veterinarian and the Pet Owner.

 Our team includes over 1,200 sales consultants, who facilitate order processing, generate new sales through direct and frequent contact with Customers, stay abreast of market developments and educate practice personnel regarding the hundreds of new products, services and technologies introduced each year. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify Customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives and telesales contact. We have also developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of veterinary practice Customers and our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our platform has a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives. 
 Laws and Regulations 
 Our pharmacy business is affected by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things, the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing and labeling of prescription and non-prescription drugs and related services. In addition, we are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and comparable state regulations affecting the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industries, including state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards, state and federal controlled substance laws, and statutes and regulations related to FDA approval of the sale and marketing of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. State pharmacy laws require pharmacies to be licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense prescription medications. 
 
8 


 Our pharmacies are located in Arizona, Nebraska and Texas. Each prescription for a medication that is fulfilled by us is also likely to be covered by the laws of the state where the Pet Owner is located. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is physically located. The laws and regulations relating to the sale and delivery of prescription medications vary from state to state, but generally require that prescription medications be dispensed with the authorization from a prescribing veterinarian. We are authorized to dispense prescription medications in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
 The sale of animal health products is also governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products. 
 United States 
 The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the United States is the Center for Veterinary Medicine, or the CVM, housed within the FDA. Generally, all animal health pharmaceuticals are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the drug is for food-producing animals, potential consequences for humans are also considered. The FDAs basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports being provided to the CVMs Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Animal supplements generally are not required to obtain premarket approval from the CVM, although they may be treated as a food. Any substance that is added to, or is expected to become a component of, animal food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe, under the conditions of its intended use. Alternatively, the FDA may consider animal supplements to be drugs. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion for such supplements as long as each such supplement meets certain conditions. 
 The regulatory body in the United States for veterinary biologics, such as vaccines, is the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA. The USDAs Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. Marketing of imported veterinary biological products in the United States requires a U.S. Veterinary Biological Product Permit. Veterinary biologics are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be pure, safe, potent and efficacious, as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-licensing monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with USDA requirements. 
 The main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides is the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA. The EPAs Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. Animal health pesticides are subject to pre-market review and must not cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies. 
 Under the Controlled Substances Act, distributors of controlled substances are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for their facilities from the DEA. Distributors are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. Distributors are subject to inspection by the DEA. 
 Advertising and promotion of animal health products that are not subject to approval by the CVM may be challenged by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, as well as by state attorneys general and by consumers 
 
9 


  under state consumer protection laws. The FTC regulates advertising pursuant to its authority to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC will find an advertisement to be deceptive if it contains a representation or omission of fact that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is material and if the advertiser does not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis, such as competent and reliable evidence, substantiating the claim. The FTC may attack unfair or deceptive advertising practices through either an administrative adjudication or judicial enforcement action, including preliminary or permanent injunction. The FTC may also seek consumer redress from the advertiser in instances of dishonest or fraudulent conduct. 
 States may require registration of animal drug distributors and wholesalers. Additional requirements may apply when the product is also a controlled substance. States work closely with the Association of American Feed Control Officials, or the AAFCO, in their regulation of animal food. The AAFCOs annual Official Publication, contains model animal and pet food labeling regulations that states may adopt. The publication is treated deferentially by the federal and state government agencies that regulate animal food. Many states require registration or licensing of animal food distributors. States may also review and approve animal food labels prior to sale of the product in their state. 
 European Union 
 Veterinary medicines (which includes both prescription and over-the-counter products) must obtain a marketing authorization, or MA, before they can be imported, marketed and sold in any EU member state. In broad terms, there are four different routes for obtaining MAs: (i) a centralized EU-wide authorization procedure; (ii) national authorization procedures for each member state; (iii) a mutual recognition procedure involving at least two member states; and (iv) the decentralized procedure. 
 The centralized authorization route is used to obtain MAs for marketing and sale of veterinary medicines throughout all of the EU member states as well as those countries in the European Free Trade Area, or the EFTA. The European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, located in London is responsible for assessing applications made under the centralized route. The agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union. The agency has a specialized veterinary review section distinct from the human medical review section. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for pharmaceuticals and vaccines. The EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. Once granted by the European Commission, or the EC, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states and EFTA states. A series of Regulations, Directives, Guidelines and EU Pharmacopeia Monographs provide the requirements for approval in the European Union. In general, these requirements are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes. The EMA works closely with the competent authorities of each member state in the regulation of veterinary medicines, including with respect to pharmacovigilance and testing for residues of veterinary medicines or illegal substances in animals and animal products. 
 Veterinary medicines can also be authorized on a national level through application to the relevant member states competent authority. If a product already has been authorized in at least one EU member state, then the mutual recognition procedure can be used to gain approval in other member states. Finally, the decentralized procedure may be used if the product is not authorized in any member state and the applicant would like authorization in several or all member states. This may occur where the centralized procedure is not mandatory, the product is not eligible for the centralized procedure or where the applicant does not wish to use the centralized procedure. 
 Animal feed additives must be authorized by the EC. The European Food Safety Authority, or the EFSA, assesses applications on behalf of the EC. The EFSA will analyze a sample of the feed additive and provide an 
 
10 


  opinion within six months of receiving the application. The EC will decide whether to grant or deny an authorization of the additive based upon this opinion. When authorized, all companies can (subject to any relevant third-party intellectual property rights) usually benefit from the authorization. 
 An EU regulation on animal medicines, which became effective in November 2018, relates to the advertising of veterinary products, in addition to various regulation that applies in individual EU member states. Health claims on animal pet food must not be misleading and claims that a food fulfills a particular nutritional need must be in line with the list of permitted claims that is published in an EU directive. 
 United Kingdom 
 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate, or the VMD is the United Kingdoms competent national authority responsible for overseeing the regulation of veterinary medicines in the United Kingdom, or the UK. UK national applications follow an approach similar to centralized EU applications. The VMD is also responsible for post-market surveillance and adverse event reporting. 
Australia 
 The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, or the APVMA, is an Australian government statutory authority established to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products in the Australian marketplace. Previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration. The primary legislation governing the APVMAs activities is the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code, or the AgVet Code. The AgVet Code is in turn given force of law pursuant to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth). 
 The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can import, promote and supply their products to the marketplace, and under the AgVet Code the APVMA must be satisfied that any active constituents or chemical products will not have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, occupational health and safety or trade, and that the product is effective for its intended use. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMAs scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments. Labeling standards apply and pre-approval is required by the APVMA for veterinary chemical products. In addition, all advertising and promotion of products is subject to the Australian Consumer Law, which, like the United States and European Union, emphasizes accuracy and transparency in advertising and prohibits any misleading or deceptive conduct. 
 If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period of time to ensure they and are still effective and safe to use. The APVMA also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or continuing registration with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases, the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market. 
 The APVMA has the power to order compulsory product recalls, and enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the AgVet Code. 
 New Zealand 
 All veterinary medicines, agricultural chemicals and vertebrate toxic agents imported into New Zealand must be authorized under the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines, or the ACVM, Act and
