Item 1.  Business. 
General 
 Alcoa Corporation, a Delaware corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, as explained below under Separation Transaction. Alcoa Corporation has its principal office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this report, unless the context otherwise requires, Alcoa or the Company, we, us, and our means Alcoa Corporation and all subsidiaries consolidated for the purposes of its financial statements. 
 Alcoa is a global industry leader in the production of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum. Alcoa is built on a foundation of strong values and operating excellence dating back nearly 130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an affordable and vital part of modern life. Since inventing the aluminum industry, and throughout our history, our talented Alcoans have followed on with breakthrough innovations and best practices that have led to efficiency, safety, sustainability, and stronger communities wherever we operate. 
 Aluminum is a commodity traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Alumina is subject to market pricing against the Alumina Price Index (API). As a result, the prices of both aluminum and alumina are subject to significant volatility and, therefore, influence the operating results of Alcoa. 
 Alcoa is a global company with 40 operating locations across 10 countries. In March 2017, the aluminum smelting, cast products and rolled products businesses, along with the majority of the energy segment assets, were combined into a new Aluminum business unit. As a result, Alcoas operations consisted of three reportable segments for 2017: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. Segment information for all prior periods presented was revised to reflect the new segment structure, as well as the new measure of profit and loss. 
 The Companys Internet address is http://www.alcoa.com. Alcoa makes available free of charge on or through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information on the Companys Internet site is not a part of, or incorporated by reference in, this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains these reports at http://www.sec.gov. 
 Separation Transaction in 2016 
 Alcoa Corporation became an independent, publicly-traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation from its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. (ParentCo or Arconic). Alcoa Upstream Corporation was formed for the purpose of holding ParentCos Alcoa Corporation Business (as defined below), and was renamed Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction and the Distribution (both of which are defined and described below). 
 On September 28, 2015, ParentCo announced its intention to separate ParentCo into two standalone, publicly traded companies (Separation Transaction). Alcoa Corporation was formed to hold ParentCos Bauxite, Alumina, Aluminum, Cast Products and Energy businesses, as well as ParentCos rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, and ParentCos 25.1% interest in the Maaden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia (Alcoa Corporation Business). Following the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation holds the assets and liabilities of ParentCo relating to those businesses and the direct and indirect subsidiary entities that operated the Alcoa Corporation Business, subject to certain exceptions. Upon completion of the Separation Transaction, ParentCo was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic) and now holds ParentCos Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% interest in the Maaden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia) and Transportation and Construction Solutions businesses (Arconic Business), including those assets and liabilities of ParentCo and its direct and indirect subsidiary entities that operated the Arconic Business, subject to certain exceptions.

On September 29, 2016, the ParentCo Board of Directors approved the distribution of 80.1% of Alcoa Corporations issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the basis of one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of ParentCo common stock held as of the close of business on October 20, 2016, the record date for the distribution (Distribution). 
 The Separation Transaction and the Distribution were subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, the SEC declaring effective a Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the SEC on October 11, 2016 (effectiveness was declared by the SEC on October 17, 2016). 
 On November 1, 2016, the Separation Transaction was completed and became effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, at which time Alcoa Corporation became an independent, publicly traded company. To effect the Separation Transaction, ParentCo undertook a series of transactions to separate the net assets and certain legal entities of ParentCo, resulting in a cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion to ParentCo by Alcoa Corporation using the net proceeds of a debt offering. Also at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 1, 2016, the Distribution occurred. Immediately following the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation stockholders owned directly 80.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation, and Arconic retained 19.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation. 146,159,428 shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock were distributed to ParentCo stockholders, and Arconic retained 36,311,767 shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock representing its 19.9% retained interest (In 2017, ParentCo divested itself of its entire interest in Alcoa Corporation). ParentCo stockholders received cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock that they would have received after application of the distribution ratio. Upon completion of the Separation Transaction and the Distribution, each ParentCo stockholder as of the record date continued to own shares of ParentCo (which, as a result of ParentCos name change to Arconic, are Arconic shares) and owned a proportionate share of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation that was distributed. ParentCo stockholders were not required to make any payment, surrender or exchange their ParentCo common stock or take any other action to receive their shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock in the Distribution. Regular-way trading of Alcoa Corporations common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 1, 2016 under the ticker symbol AA. Alcoa Corporations common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share. 
 Formation of Alcoa Corporation 
 Alcoa Upstream Corporation was formed in Delaware on March 10, 2016 for the purpose of holding ParentCos Alcoa Corporation Business, and it was renamed Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction and the Distribution. 
 As part of the Separation Transaction, and prior to the Distribution, ParentCo and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization in order to transfer the Alcoa Corporation Business to Alcoa Corporation. Among other things and subject to limited exceptions, the internal reorganization resulted in Alcoa Corporation owning, directly or indirectly, the operations comprising, and the entities that conduct, the Alcoa Corporation Business. The internal reorganization included various restructuring transactions pursuant to which the operations, assets, liabilities and investments of ParentCo and its subsidiaries used to conduct the Alcoa Corporation Business were separated from the operations, assets, liabilities and investments of ParentCo and its subsidiaries used to conduct the Arconic Business. Such restructuring transactions took the form of asset transfers, dividends, contributions and similar transactions, and involved the formation of new subsidiaries in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to own and operate the Alcoa Corporation Business or the Arconic Business in such jurisdictions. 
 Following the completion of the internal reorganization and immediately prior to the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation became the parent company of the entities that conduct the Alcoa Corporation Business, and ParentCo (through subsidiaries other than Alcoa Corporation and its subsidiaries) remained the parent company of the entities that conduct the Arconic Business. 
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, as of October 31, 2016, Alcoa Corporation entered into certain agreements with Arconic to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies to govern the 
 
2 
 
 relationship between Alcoa Corporation and Arconic after the completion of the Separation Transaction and allocate between Alcoa Corporation and Arconic various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement, and certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License, and Trademark License Agreements.

Exclusivity 
 Under the terms of their joint venture agreements, Alcoa and Alumina Limited have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, AWAC is their exclusive vehicle for their investments, operations or participation in the bauxite and alumina business, and they will not compete with AWAC in those businesses. In the event of a change of control of either Alcoa or Alumina Limited, this exclusivity and non-compete restriction will terminate, and the partners will then have opportunities to unilaterally pursue bauxite or alumina projects outside of or within AWAC, subject to certain conditions provided in the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategic Council. 
Equity Calls 
 The cash flow of AWAC and borrowings are the preferred sources of funding for the needs of AWAC. Should the aggregate annual capital budget of AWAC require an equity contribution from Alcoa and Alumina Limited, an equity call can be made on 30 days notice, subject to certain limitations. 
Dividend Policy 
 AWAC will generally be required to distribute at least 50% of the prior calendar quarters net income of each AWAC company, and certain AWAC companies will also be required to pay a distribution every three months equal to the amount of available cash above specified thresholds and subject to the forecast cash needs of the company. Alcoa will obtain a limited amount of debt funding for the AWAC companies to fund growth projects, subject to certain restrictions. 
Leveraging Policy 
 Debt of AWAC is subject to a limit of 30% of total capital (defined as the sum of debt (net of cash) plus any minority interest plus shareholder equity). The AWAC joint venture will raise a limited amount of debt to fund growth projects within 12 months of it becoming permissible under Alcoas revolving credit line, provided that the amount of debt does not trigger a credit rating downgrade for Alcoa. 
Other 
 In December 2009, we entered into a joint venture with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden), which was formed by the government of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This project is one of the most efficient integrated aluminum production complexes within the worldwide Alcoa system. In its initial phases, the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million bone dry metric tons per year; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million metric tons per year (mtpy); an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The smelter, refinery and mine are fully operational. Maaden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and in the rolling mill; AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery.

 Aluminum is one of the most abundant elements in the earths crust. Aluminum metal is produced by smelting alumina using large amounts of electricity, and can be cast and rolled into many shapes and forms. Alumina is an intermediary product produced primarily from refining bauxite. The following tables and related discussion provide additional description of Alcoas businesses along this value chain. 
 The Companys business segments in 2017 were Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. In the first quarter of 2017, management initiated a realignment of the Companys internal business and organizational structure, which consisted of combining the Companys aluminum smelting, casting, and rolling businesses, along with the majority of the energy business, into a new Aluminum business unit, which now is managed as a single operating segment. Prior to this 
 
5 
 
 change, each of these businesses that now comprise the Aluminum segment were managed as individual operating segments and constituted the Aluminum, Cast Products, Energy, and Rolled Products segments. For more information regarding the segment reorganization, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationAluminum. 
 The existing Bauxite and Alumina segments and the new Aluminum segment represent the Companys operating and reportable segments. The Bauxite and Alumina segments primarily consist of a series of affiliated operating entities in a joint venture collectively referred to as AWAC. Alcoa ultimately owns 60% and Alumina Limited, an unrelated third party, ultimately owns 40% of these individual entities. 
 Bauxite 
 This segment represents the Companys global bauxite mining operations. Bauxite is Alcoas basic raw material input for its alumina refining process and is also sold into the third-party market. Bauxite contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina and sells the remainder to third parties. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported as dry metric tons (dmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining-related terms at the end of this section. 
 During 2017, mines operated by Alcoa produced 39.0 million dmt and separately mines operated by partnerships or consortiums that include Alcoa and AWAC equity interests produced 6.8 million dmt on a proportional equity basis for a total bauxite production of 45.8 million dmt. 
 Based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, AWAC bauxite purchases from Mineração Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN) and Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore during 2017, including those purchases, AWAC had access to 47.7 million dmt of production from its portfolio of bauxite interests. 
 During 2017, AWAC sold 6.6 million dmt of bauxite to third parties and purchased 0.1 million dmt from third parties. The bauxite delivered to Alcoa and AWAC refineries amounted to 41.0 million dmt during 2017. 
 The Company is growing its third-party bauxite sales business. For example, in December 2016, Alcoas affiliate, AofA, received permission from the Government of Western Australia to export up to 2.5 million dmt per year of bauxite for five years to third-party customers. Contracts for bauxite have generally been short-term contracts (two years or less in duration) with spot pricing and adjustments for quality and logistics, although the Company is currently pursuing long-term contracts with potential customers. The primary customer base for third-party bauxite is located in Asiaparticularly China. The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drilling grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing us to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves. 
 The following table only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of 
 
6 
 
 reserves for the Companys mining locations and consistent with the Company reserves strategy. Given the Companys extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the Companys rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the significant funds and efforts necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Bauxite Resource and Reserve Development Guidelines 
 Alcoa has adopted best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoas reserves are declared in accordance with its internal guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserves Committee (AORC) and certified by Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code). The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that we estimated could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. We do not use a price for bauxite, alumina or aluminum to determine our bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the receiving alumina refinery. More specifically, reserves are set based on the chemical composition of the bauxite in order to minimize bauxite processing cost and maximize refinery economics for each individual refinery. The primary specifications that are important to this analysis are the available alumina and reactive silica content of the bauxite. Each alumina refinery will have a target specification for these parameters, but may receive bauxite within a range that allows blending in stockpiles to achieve the receiving refinerys target. 
 In addition to these chemical specifications, a number of other ore reserve design factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. The contours of the bauxite reserves are designed using parameters such as available alumina content cutoff grade, reactive silica cutoff grade, ore density, overburden thickness, ore thickness and mine access considerations. These parameters are generally determined by using infill drilling or geological modeling. 
 Further, our mining locations utilize annual in-fill drilling or geological modeling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite based on the above-described factors.

 Qualifying statements relating to the table above: 
 AustraliaDarling Range Mines: Huntly and Willowdale are the two active AWAC mines in the Darling Range of Western Australia. The mineral lease issued by the State of Western Australia to Alcoa Corporations majority owned subsidiary, AofA is known as ML1SA and encompasses a gross area of 712,881 hectares (including private land holdings, state forests, national parks and conservation areas) in the Darling Range and extends from east of Perth to east of Bunbury (ML1SA Area). The ML1SA lease provides AofA with various rights, including certain exclusivity rights to explore for and mine bauxite, rights to deny third party mining tenements in limited circumstances, rights to mining leases for other minerals in the ML1SA Area, and the right to prevent certain governmental actions from interfering with or prejudicially affecting AofAs rights. The ML1SA lease term extends to 2024; however, it can be renewed for an additional 21-year period to 2045. The above-declared reserves are current as of December 31, 2017. The amount of reserves reflects the total AWAC share. Additional resources are routinely upgraded by additional exploration and development drilling to reserve status. The Huntly and Willowdale mines supply bauxite to three local AWAC alumina refineries. 
 BrazilPoços de Caldas: The above-declared reserves are current as of December 31, 2017. Tonnage is total Alcoa share. Additional resources are being upgraded to reserves as needed.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture 
 In December 2009, ParentCo and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden), which was formed by the government of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases, the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million dmt per year; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mtpy; an aluminum smelter with an initial ingot, slab and billet capacity of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The smelter, refinery and mine are fully operational. Maaden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and in the rolling mill; and AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery. 
 The refinery, smelter and rolling mill are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
 For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

Alumina 
 This segment represents the Companys worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. Alcoas largest customer for smelter grade alumina is its own aluminum smelters, which in 2017 accounted for approximately 35% of its total alumina sales. A portion of the alumina is sold to external customers who process it into industrial chemical products. Remaining sales are made to customers all over the world and are typically priced by reference to published spot market prices. 
 This segment also includes AWACs 25.1% share of the results of a mining and re-fining joint venture company in Saudi Arabia. 
 In 2010, a number of key commodity information service providers began publishing daily and weekly alumina (spot) pricing assessments or indices rather than calculating alumina price as a percentage of the LME aluminum price, as had been done traditionally. Since that time, Alcoa has been systematically moving its third-party alumina sales contracts away from LME aluminum-based pricing to published alumina spot or index pricing, thus de-linking the price for alumina from the aluminum price to better reflect aluminas distinct fundamentals. Contracts for smelter grade alumina are often multi-year, although contract structures have evolved from primarily long-term contracts with fixed or LME-based pricing to shorter-term contracts with more frequent pricing adjustment to reflect this change in pricing structure. In 2017, approximately 86% of Alcoa Corporations smelter grade alumina shipments to third parties were sold at published spot/index prices.

 As of December 31, 2017, Alcoa had approximately 2,305,000 mtpy of idle capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 15,064,000 mtpy. As noted above, Alcoa and Maaden developed an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is 1,800,000 mtpy, and it produced approximately 1,474,000 metric tons (mt) in 2017. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption InvestmentsEquity Investments. 
 
15 
 
In March 2015, ParentCo initiated a 12-month review of 2,800,000 mtpy in refining capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture, as part of an effort to lower the position of the Companys refining operations on the global alumina cost curve. The review resulted in the curtailment of the remaining capacity at the Suralco refinery (1,330,000 mtpy) in 2015 and the commencement of the curtailment of the remaining capacity of the Point Comfort, TX refinery (2,010,000 mtpy), which curtailment was completed in the first half of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Alcoa determined to close the Suralco alumina refinery and bauxite mines in Suriname, which have been fully curtailed since November 2015. For additional information regarding the curtailments, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationAlumina. 
 Aluminum 
 In the first quarter of 2017, Alcoa Corporation realigned the Companys internal business and organizational structure. This realignment consisted of combining Alcoa Corporations aluminum smelting, casting, and rolling businesses, along with the majority of the energy business, into a new Aluminum business unit. 
 This segments combined smelting and casting operations produce primary aluminum. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations into either foundry ingot or into value-add ingot products, including billet, rod, and slab. The primary purpose of the energy assets is to supply power to certain of this segments smelting operations, as well as to the rolling mill. However, these energy assets provide operational flexibility to maximize operating results during market cyclicality through the sale of excess energy. The rolling mill produces aluminum sheet primarily sold directly to customers in the packaging end market for the production of aluminum cans. This segment also includes Alcoas 25.1% share of the results of a both a smelting and rolling mill joint venture company in Saudi Arabia.

 As of December 31, 2017, Alcoa Corporation had approximately 856,000 mtpy of idle capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 3,211,000 mtpy. 
 
17 
 
In July 2017, Alcoa announced plans to restart three (approximately 161,000 mtpy of capacity) of the five potlines (269,000 mtpy of capacity) at the Warrick smelter, which is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018. This smelter was previously permanently closed in March 2016. The capacity identified for restart will directly supply the existing rolling mill at the Warrick location, to improve efficiency of the integrated site and provide an additional source of metal to help meet an anticipated increase in production volumes. Because the smelter will be partially restarted, the capacity of the Warrick smelter was included in the Alcoas consolidated capacity at December 31, 2017. Additionally, until the partial restart is completed, the capacity of the Warrick smelter was included in idle capacity at December 31, 2017. Once the partial restart of the Warrick smelter occurs, approximately 161,000 mtpy will be removed from idle capacity. 
 In October 2017, Alcoa and Luminant Generation Company LLC (Luminant) executed an early termination agreement of a power contract (see Energy SourcesElectricityNorth America below), as well as other related fuel and lease agreements, effective October 1, 2017, related to the Companys Rockdale smelter, which had been fully curtailed since the end of 2008. As a result of the early termination of the power contract, Alcoa initiated a strategic review of the remaining buildings and equipment associated with the smelter, casthouse, and the aluminum powder plant at the Rockdale location. ParentCo previously decided to curtail the operating capacity of the Rockdale smelter in 2008 as a result of an uncompetitive power supply and then-overall unfavorable market conditions. Under this review, which was completed in December 2017, management determined that the Rockdale operations have limited economic prospects. Consequently, management approved the permanent closure and demolition of the Rockdale smelter (capacity of approximately 191,000 mtpy) and related operations effective immediately. Accordingly, the Rockdale smelter has been removed from the preceding table. 
 Contracts for primary aluminum vary widely in duration, from multi-year supply contracts to monthly or weekly spot purchases. Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the published LME aluminum price for commodity grade P1020 aluminum, (ii) the published regional premium applicable to the delivery locale and (iii) a negotiated product premium which accounts for factors such as shape and alloy. In recent years, we have seen increasing trade flows of commodity and higher value-added products between regions, with surplus regions supplying missing volumes to deficit regions. The flow patterns consider shipping costs, import duties, and premiums in the importing regions. 
 For additional information regarding the curtailments and closures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRestructuring and Other Charges. 
 Rolled Products 
 The Aluminum segments rolled products business consists of the Companys rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, which produces aluminum sheet primarily sold directly to customers in the packaging end market for the production of aluminum cans (beverage and food) and Alcoas investment in a rolling mill in Saudi Arabia through its Maaden joint venture. For additional information about the Maaden joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 
 Alcoas rolled products business participates in several market segments, including beverage can sheet, food can sheet, lithographic sheet, and industrial products. The term RCS or Rigid Container Sheet is commonly used for both beverage and food can sheet. This includes the material used to produce the body of beverage containers (body stock), the lid of beverage containers (end stock and tab stock), the material to produce food can body and lids (food stock), and the material to produce aluminum bottles (bottle stock) and bottle closures (closure sheet). The U.S. aluminum can business consists of approximately 96% beverage can sheet and approximately 4% food can sheet. Alcoa is one of the largest food can sheet producers in North America. Alcoa intends to suspend supply of lithographic sheet in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Buyers of RCS products in North America are large and concentrated and have significant market power. There are essentially five buyers of all the U.S. beverage can sheet sold in the beverage industry (three can makers and the two 
 
18 
 
 beverage companies). In 2017, we estimate the North American aluminum can sheet buyers and their respective shares of the industry are: AB-Inbev (>39%), Coca-Cola (>21%), Ball Corporation (>18%), Crown Cork & Seal Company (>15%), Ardagh Group (>5%) and others (2%). Buyers traditionally buy RCS in proportions that represent the full aluminum can (80% body stock, 20% end and tab stock). In addition, as the aluminum can sheet represents approximately 60% of their manufacturing costs, there is a heavy focus on cost. 
 The market for aluminum food can sheet in North America is also very concentrated. In 2017, we estimate the following market shares of aluminum food can producers in North America: Silgan (>85%), Crown (>12%), Ardagh (>2%) and others (1%). 
 In 2017, our Warrick facility produced and sold 317 kilo metric tons (kMT) of RCS, lithographic sheet, and industrial products, of which over 98% was sold to customers in North America. The majority of its sales were coated RCS products (food stock, beverage end and tab stock). Following the Separation Transaction, both Warrick and Maaden supply body stock material, temporarily supplemented by Arconics Tennessee Operations under a transition supply agreement. Seasonal increases in can sheet sales are generally expected in the second and third quarters of the year. 
 Can sheet demand is a function of consumer demand for beverages in aluminum packaging. Aluminum cans have a number of functional advantages for beverage companies, including product shelf life, carbonation retention, and logistics/distribution efficiency. Demand is mostly affected by overall demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and beer. CSDs and beer compose approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of overall aluminum can demand. In 2017, the U.S./Canada aluminum can shipments reached 93.5 billion cans, a decline of 0.9% over 2016. Alcoholic can shipments reached 36.5 billion cans, declining 3.8% year over year, while non-alcoholic can shipments were 57.0 billion, growing 1.0% year over year. 
 Energy Facilities and Sources 
 Employing the Bayer process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. We then produce aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy accounts for approximately 20% of the Companys total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 24% of the Companys primary aluminum production costs. 
 Electricity markets are regional. They are limited in size by physical and regulatory constraints, including the physical inability to transport electricity efficiently over long distances, the design of the electric grid, including interconnections, and by the regulatory structure imposed by various federal and state entities. 
 Electricity contracts may be very short term (real-time), short term (day ahead) or years in duration, and contracts can be executed for immediate delivery or years in advance. Pricing may be fixed, indexed to an underlying fuel source or other index such as LME, cost-based or based on regional market pricing. Pricing may be all inclusive on a per energy unit delivered basis (e.g., dollars per megawatt hour) or the components may be separated and include a demand or capacity charge, an energy charge, an ancillary services charge and a transmission charge to make the delivered energy conform to customer requirements. In 2017, Alcoa generated approximately 3% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchased the remainder under long-term arrangements. 
 The sections below provide an overview of our energy facilities and summarize the sources of energy for our smelters and refineries.

 Alumínio owns a 25.74% stake in Consórcio Machadinho, which is the owner of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. Alumínio also has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A. (BAESA), which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. In addition, Alumínio also has a 34.97% share in Serra do Facão Energia S.A., which built the Serra do Facão hydroelectric power plant in the southeast of Brazil. Alumínio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, through Estreito Energia S.A. (an Alumínio wholly owned company) holding a 25.49% stake in Consórcio Estreito Energia, which is the owner of the hydroelectric power plant. 
 Since May 2015 (after curtailment of the Poços de Caldas and São Luís smelters), the excess generation capacity from the above Brazilian hydroelectric projects, of around 480MW annually, has been sold into the market. 
 Power generated from Afobaka is sold to the Government of Suriname under a bilateral contract. 
 In February 2017, Alcoa Corporations wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), completed the sale of its 215-megawatt Yadkin Hydroelectric Project (Yadkin) to Cube Hydro Carolinas, LLC. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement (see Note A), Alcoa Corporation remitted a portion of the proceeds to Arconic. Yadkin encompasses four hydroelectric power developments (reservoirs, dams, and powerhouses), known as High Rock, Tuckertown, Narrows, and Falls, situated along a 38-mile stretch of the Yadkin River through the central part of North Carolina. Prior to the divestiture, the power generated by Yadkin was primarily sold into the open market. Accordingly, the Yadkin energy facilities have been removed from the preceding table. 
 APGIs Warrick power plant generates substantially all of the power used at the Warrick smelter and rolling mill using nearby coal reserves. Alcoa owns the nearby Liberty Mine, which is operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. at a level of approximately 1.2 million tons per year. Liberty Mine supplies all of the power plants coal needs. A public process is currently underway before the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to permit an additional 3,500 acres south of the existing Liberty Mine permit. The expansion will secure a continued source of fuel for the Warrick power plant. During 2017, approximately 26% of the capacity from the Warrick power plant was sold into the market under its current operating permits. APGI also owns certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated transmission assets in Indiana, Tennessee, New York, and Washington.

Electricity 
 North America 
 The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase all or a majority of their electricity under contracts with Hydro-Québec that expire on December 31, 2029. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Québec purchases approximately 73% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, and the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. For the Baie Comeau smelter, the Hydro-Québec contract can be extended until February 23, 2036. 
 In the State of Washington, Alcoas Wenatchee smelter is served by a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District No. 1 (Chelan PUD) under which Alcoa receives 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUDs Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. The Wenatchee smelter was curtailed in 2015. 
 Starting on January 1, 2013, the Intalco smelter began receiving physical power under a contract with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) at the Northwest Power Act mandated industrial firm power (IP) rate through September 30, 2022. Additional power is purchased from the market as needed. In May 2015, the contract was amended to reduce the amount of physical power received from BPA and allow for additional purchases of market power. In February and April 2016, the contract was amended again to reduce the contractual amount through February 2018, following which Intalco will resume receiving physical contracted quantities of power at the mandated IP rate. 
 Luminant supplied all of the Rockdale smelters electricity requirements under a long-term power contract that was not set to expire before the end of 2038, except for limited circumstances in which one or both parties could elect to early terminate without penalty for which conditions had not been met. As discussed above, in October 2017, Alcoa Corporation and Luminant reached agreement on restructuring their relationship at Rockdale, including agreeing upon the terms for termination of the electricity contract between the parties. On December 21, 2017 Alcoa announced the permanent closure of the Rockdale smelter and related operations, which has been curtailed since 2008. 
 In the Northeast, the Massena West smelter in New York receives power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA that will expire in 2019. 
 Australia 
 The Portland smelter purchased electricity from the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) under a contract with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, that extended to October 2016. Upon the expiration of this contract, the Portland smelter commenced to purchase power from the National Electricity Market (NEM) variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd separately entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang (now AGL Energy Ltd) in order to manage their exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Portland smelter commenced operating from the date of expiration of the contract with the SECV and was terminated in accordance with its terms, effective July 31, 2017. A new fixed for floating swap contract for the Portland smelter was entered into with AGL in January 2017 that commenced on August 1, 2017 and will expire on July 31, 2021. 
Europe 
 Alcoas smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and Avilés, Spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that expire December 31, 2018. 
 As a large consumer of electricity, Alcoa participates in a demand response program in Spain, agreeing to reduce usage of electricity for a specific period of time, in return for compensation, which allows the utility or grid operator to divert electricity during times of peak demand. A competitive bidding mechanism to allocate these interruptibility rights in 
 
21 
 
 Spain was settled during 2014 to be applied starting from January 1, 2015 and with several auctions to allocate annual rights taking place since then. The last auction process to allocate rights took place in December 2017, where Alcoa secured 595MW of interruptibility rights for the period of January to May 2018 for the three Spanish smelters. 
 Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, which have long-term power arrangements in place that continue until the end of 2019. During 2017, Alcoa entered into several power purchase agreements, securing approximately 75% and 25% of the necessary power for the Norway smelters in 2020 and for 2021 through 2034, respectively. The Company continues to seek and negotiate additional power contracts for years subsequent to 2019. In addition, for Alcoas smelters in Norway, the financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed through in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission Guidelines and Norwegian compensation regime. 
 Iceland 
 Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, supplies competitively priced electricity to Alcoas Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland under a 40-year power contract, which will expire in 2047. 
 Natural Gas 
 Spain 
 To facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprián, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alúmina Española S.A. (AE) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (GN) signed a take-or-pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, ParentCo and Alumina Limited, agreed to guarantee the payment of AEs contracted gas pipeline utilization over the four years of the commitment period; in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder is responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment came into force six months after the gas pipeline was put into operation by GN. The gas pipeline was completed in January 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100% of its needs. The ParentCo guarantee has been replaced with an Alcoa Corporation guarantee. 
 In 2017, natural gas was supplied to the San Ciprián, Spain alumina refinery pursuant to two supply contracts with Endesa, expiring in June and December 2017, and one supply contract with Gas Natural Fenosa (GNF), expiring in December 2017. Following expiration of those contracts, natural gas is now supplied pursuant to two supply contracts with Endesa, expiring in June and December 2018, a supply contract with BP expiring in June 2018 and an additional supply contract with Axpo expiring in December 2018. 
 North America 
 In order to supply its refinery and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. Pipeline transportation may be procured directly or via the local distribution companies. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption. 
Australia 
 AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. More than 90% of AofAs gas requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. In 2015, AofA secured a significant portion of its gas supplies to 2032. 
 
22 
 
Other 
 The Company has a calciner facility located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. This facility converts green coke into calcined coke, which is used as a raw material for the anode formation process at an aluminum smelter. The Lake Charles facility was curtailed in December 2015 due to an equipment failure and restarted again in July 2017. In addition, the Companys Gum Springs facility processes spent potlining and is located in Arkansas. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 Generally, materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. The Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available. 
 For each metric ton (mt) of alumina produced, Alcoa Corporation consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities): 
 

Raw Material | Units | Consumption per MT of Alumina
Bauxite | mt | 2.2  3.7 
Caustic soda | kg | 60  100 
Electricity | kWh | 0 to 210 imported 
Fuel oil and natural gas | GJ | 6.2  12.2 
Lime (CaO) | kg | 6  60 

 For each metric ton of aluminum produced, Alcoa Corporation consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities): 
 

Raw Material | Units | Consumption per MT of Primary Aluminum
Alumina | mt | 1.92 ± 0.02 
Aluminum fluoride | kg | 17.1 ± 5.0 
Calcined petroleum coke | mt | 0.37 ± 0.05 
Cathode blocks | mt | 0.005 ± 0.002 
Electricity | kWh | 12900 17000 
Liquid pitch | mt | 0.10 ± 0.03 
Natural gas | mcf | 3.0 ± 1.0 

 Certain aluminum we produce includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce our various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa Corporation is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts. 
 Competition 
 Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the aluminum supply chain in which it competes. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Brand name recognition and loyalty also play a role. In addition, Alcoas competitive position depends, in part, on the Companys access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. 
 
23 
 
Bauxite: 
 The third-party market for metallurgical grade bauxite is relatively new and growing quickly as global demand for bauxite increasesparticularly in China. The majority of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production of aluminum metal. While Alcoa has historically mined bauxite for internal consumption in our alumina refineries, we are focused on building our third-party bauxite business to meet growing demand. 
 Our principal competitors in the third-party bauxite market include Rio Tinto, Norsk Hydro and multiple suppliers from Guinea, Malaysia, India and other countries. We compete largely based on bauxite quality, price and proximity to customers and end markets. Alcoa has a strong competitive position in this market for the following reasons: 
 

 | Low cost production: Alcoa is among the worlds largest bauxite miners, holding a strong global cost curve position, with best practices in efficient mining operations and sustainability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reliable, long-term bauxite resources: Alcoas strategic bauxite mine locations include Australia and Brazil as well as Guinea, which is home to the worlds largest reserves of high-quality metallurgical grade bauxite. Alcoa has a long history of stable operations in these countries and has access to large bauxite deposits with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Access to markets: Alcoas Australian bauxite mines are located in close proximity to the largest third-party customer base in China and our facilities are also accessible to a significant and growing alumina refining base in the Middle East.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alumina: 
 The alumina market is global and highly competitive, with many active suppliers including producers as well as commodity traders. Alcoa faces competition from a number of companies in all of the regions in which we operate, including Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, China Hongqiao Group Limited, Hindalco Industries Ltd., Hangzhou Jinjiang Group, National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO), Noranda Aluminum Holding Corporation, Norsk Hydro ASA, Rio Tinto, South32 Limited, State Power Investment Corporation, United Company RUSAL Plc, and Chiping Xinfa Alumina Product Co., Ltd. In recent years, there has been significant growth in alumina refining in China and India. The majority of our product is sold in the form of smelter grade alumina, with 5% to 10% of total global alumina production being produced for non-metallurgical applications. 
 Key factors influencing competition in the alumina market include: cost position, price, reliability of bauxite supply, quality and proximity to customers and end markets. While we face competition from many industry players, we have several competitive advantages: 
 

 | Proximity to bauxite: Our refineries are strategically located next to low cost bauxite mines, and our alumina refineries are tuned to maximize efficiency with the exact bauxite qualities from these internal mines. In addition to refining efficiencies, vertical integration affords a stable and consistent long-term supply of bauxite to our refining portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Low cost production: As the worlds largest alumina producer outside of China, Alcoa has competitive, efficient assets across its refining portfolio, with a 2017 average cost position in the first quartile of global alumina production. Contributing to this cost position is our experienced workforce and sophistication in refining technology and process automation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Access to markets: Alcoa is a global supplier of alumina with refining operations in the key markets of North America (curtailed), South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia, enabling us to meet customer demand in the Atlantic and Pacific basins, including China.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aluminum 
 In our Aluminum segment, competition is dependent upon the type of product we are selling. 
 
24 
 
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with commodity traders and aluminum producers such as Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, China Hongqiao Group Limited, East Hope Group Co. Ltd., Emirates Global Aluminum, Norsk Hydro, Rio Tinto, Shandong Xinfa Aluminum & Power Group, State Power Investment Co. (SPIC), and United Company RUSAL Plc, as well as with alternative materials such as steel, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications. 
 The aluminum industry itself is highly competitive; some of the most critical competitive factors in our industry are product quality, production costs (including source and cost of energy), price, proximity to raw materials, customers and end markets, timeliness of delivery, customer service (including technical support), and product innovation and breadth of offerings. Where aluminum products compete with other materials, the diverse characteristics of aluminum are also a significant factor, particularly its light weight, strength and recyclability. 
 In addition, in some end-use markets, competition is also affected by customer requirements that suppliers complete a qualification process to supply their plants. This process can be rigorous and may take many months to complete. However, the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage. 
 The strength of our position in the primary aluminum market is largely attributable to the following factors: 
 

 | Value-added product portfolio: Alcoas casthouses supply global customers with a diverse product portfolio, both in terms of shapes and alloys. We offer differentiated products that are cast into specific shapes to meet customer demand, with 65% of 2017 smelter shipments representing value-added products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Low cost production: Alcoa leverages significant economies of scale to continuously reduce costs. As a result, Alcoa operates competitive, efficient assets across its aluminum smelting and casting portfolios, with its 2017 average smelting cost position in the second quartile of global aluminum smelters. This cost position is supported by long-term energy arrangements at many locations; Alcoa has secured approximately 57% of its smelter power needs through 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Access to markets: Alcoa is a global supplier of aluminum with smelting and casting operations in the key markets of North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia, enabling us to access a broad customer base with competitive logistics costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sustainability: As of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of our aluminum smelting portfolio runs on clean hydroelectric power, lessening our demand for fossil fuels and potentially mitigating the risk to the Company from future carbon tax legislation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Alcoa owns generation and transmission assets that produce and sell electric energy and ancillary services in the United States and Brazilian wholesale energy markets. Our competitors include integrated electric utilities that may be owned by governments (either fully or partially), cooperatives or investors, independent power producers and energy brokers and traders. 
 Competition factors in open power markets include fuel supply, production costs, operational reliability, access to the power grid, and environmental attributes (e.g., green power and renewable energy credits). As electricity is difficult and cost prohibitive to store, there are no electricity inventories to cushion the impact of supply and demand factors and the resultant pricing in electricity markets may be volatile. Demand for power varies greatly both seasonally and by time of day. Supply may be impacted in the short term by unplanned generator outages or transmission congestion and longer term by planned generator outages, droughts, high precipitation levels and fuel pricing (coal and/or natural gas). 
 
25 
 
Alcoas energy assets enjoy several competitive advantages, when compared to other power suppliers: 
 

 | Reliability: In the United States, we have operated our thermal energy assets for over 50 years with a high degree of reliability and expect to continue this level of performance. In Brazil, our ownership provides for assured energy from hydroelectric operations through 2032 to 2037.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Access and proximity to markets: Our U.S. assets are positioned to take advantage of sales into some of the more liquid power markets, including sales of both energy and capacity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sustainable (green) energy sources: A majority of our generating assets use renewable (hydroelectric) sources of fuel for generation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our rolled products business participates in various market segments, including beverage can sheet, food can sheet, lithographic sheet, aluminum bottle sheet, and industrial products and in the U.S. competes with other North American producers of RCS products, namely Novelis Corp, Tri-Arrows Aluminum, and Constellium NV. There is also import supply of RCS from China (Nanshan) and Western Europe (Hydro and Eval) mainly for the beverage market. 
 We also compete against package types made of other materials including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, glass bottles, steel tin plate and other materials. In the U.S., aluminum cans, PET bottles and glass bottles represent approximately 69%, 29% and 2%, respectively, of the CSDs segment. In the beer segment, aluminum cans, glass bottles, and aluminum bottles represent approximately 74%, 22% and 5%, respectively, of the business. In the food can segment, steel tin plate cans and aluminum food cans represent approximately 83% and 17%, respectively, with aluminum cans representing approximately 52% of the pet food segment. 
 We compete on cost, quality, and service. The Company intends to continue to improve our cost position by increasing recycled aluminum content in our metal feedstock as well as continuing to focus on capacity utilization. We believe our team of technical and operational resources provides distinctive quality and customer service. 
 Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks 
 The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Companys rights under its intellectual property, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Alcoas business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2017, Alcoas worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 675 granted patents and 300 pending patent applications. The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served, including the name Alcoa and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products. 
 As part of the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic entered into certain intellection property license agreements between them. These agreements provide for a license of certain patents, trademarks and know-how from Arconic to Alcoa Corporation, as applicable, to the other on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis, subject to certain exceptions. In June 2017, Alcoa entered into an Amended and Restated Trademark License Agreement with Arconic. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director IndependenceAgreements with ArconicIntellectual Property License Agreements. 
Research and Development 
 Expenditures for research and development activities (R&D) were $32 million in 2017, $33 million in 2016, and $69 million in 2015. 
 
26 
 
Environmental Matters 
 Alcoa is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, greenhouse gas emissions, and the health and safety of our employees. We participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at approximately 60 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. Approved capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control were approximately $92 million for 2017 and are approximately $150 million for 2018. Additional information relating to environmental matters is included in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Contingencies and CommitmentsEnvironmental Matters. 
Employees 
 At the end of 2017, Alcoa had approximately 14,600 employees in 15 countries. Approximately 9,600 of these employees are represented by labor unions. In the U.S., approximately 2,300 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest collective bargaining agreement is the master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers (USW). The USW master agreement covers approximately 1,600 employees at six U.S. locations. There are three other collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. with varying expiration dates. On a regional basis, collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover approximately 2,100 employees in Europe, 1,600 employees in Canada, 900 employees in Central and South America, and 2,600 employees in Australia. 
 On January 11, 2018, a lockout of the bargained hourly employees commenced at the Bécancour smelter, impacting approximately 1,000 employees at this facility. The Bécancour facility is owned by Alcoa (74.95%) and Rio Tinto (25.05%). For additional information, see footnote 10 to the table in Smelting Operations under the Aluminum segment above.
