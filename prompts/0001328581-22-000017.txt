•Respect - We cultivate a climate of mutual respect, camaraderie, and teamwork. We welcome diverse backgrounds, views, and skills because we believe it results in stronger teams, inspired solutions, and greater agility as an organization.

•Pursuit of Excellence - We are committed to the continuous improvement of people, processes, and the quality of products that we deliver. We apply best practices in our environmental management and forest stewardship. We all have the autonomy to apply our knowledge and experience to solve problems, make decisions, and implement new ideas to drive sustainable results.

Segment Overview
              Our two reportable segments, Wood Products and Building Materials Distribution, operate with a high degree of vertical integration. In our Wood Products segment, we manufacture laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-joists, and laminated beams, which are collectively referred to as EWP. In addition, we manufacture structural, appearance, and industrial plywood panels, and ponderosa pine lumber. Our Building Materials Distribution segment (BMD) is the largest customer of our Wood Products segment, and operates a nationwide network of distribution facilities that sell a broad line of building materials, including oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, and lumber (collectively referred to as commodities); general line items such as siding, composite decking, doors, metal products, insulation, and roofing; and EWP. Substantially all of BMD's EWP is sourced from our Wood Products segment, with the remaining products we distribute sourced from a broad vendor base of third-party suppliers ranging from large manufacturers to small regional producers.

    Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair-and-remodeling of existing housing, the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings, and industrial applications. We have a broad base of national and local customers, which includes a diverse mix of dealers, home improvement centers, leading wholesalers, specialty distributors, and industrial converters. Drivers of new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity, and light commercial construction include new household formation, the age of the housing stock, availability of credit and other macroeconomic factors, such as GDP growth, population growth and migration, interest rates, employment, and consumer sentiment. 
    The map below presents our network of manufacturing and distribution facilities.

Our Business Strategies
Increase Both Our Earnings and Earnings Stability
    We intend to increase both our earnings and earnings stability by growing our EWP sales and expanding our distribution capabilities. In Wood Products, we are principally focused on the production of veneer-based products. We have grown our EWP sales and thereby diverted more of our internally produced veneer away from plywood, which is a product line exposed to oriented strand board substitution and significant price volatility. In addition, we have divested of assets that we considered to be non-strategic or where we believed we were unlikely to generate a sufficient return on invested capital in the future. In BMD, our growth strategy includes adding products and services, expanding our market penetration via acquisition or the opening or expansion of locations in under-served markets, and identifying and executing upon adjacent distribution platforms that can be scaled. Doors provides a recent example of product line expansion in BMD. In 2020 and 2021, we expanded our door shop assembly operations with the addition of assembly equipment in Dallas, Texas, and Houston, Texas. Also in 2021, we completed or announced capacity expansion projects in Nashville, Tennessee; Marion, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. These organic growth projects allow us to further expand our product and service offerings in those markets. 
    The change in our sales mix by segment over time from reducing our product mix in Wood Products and expanding our BMD distribution capabilities is illustrated below.



    Wood Products' change in sales mix by product line over time is illustrated below.

    The charts below illustrate our growth in EWP and how we have transitioned more of our veneer usage to support our EWP growth.



    In BMD, we have grown by adding products and services, capturing additional market share in many of our existing markets, expanding our market presence via acquisition or start-up or expansion of locations, and by identifying and executing upon adjacent distribution platforms. BMD carries a broad line of building materials used in residential construction, repair and remodel, and industrial applications. The chart below reflects BMD's sales mix by product for the year ended December 31, 2021.
    BMD's growth in sales dollars and sales per U.S. housing start are reflected in the chart below.

    A map of BMD's distribution locations is shown below. The red stars are BMD's locations, the size of the circles indicate the level of residential construction activity in that trade area (Core-Based Statistical Area or CBSA), and the color of the circles indicate how close our distribution centers are to each major trade area. During 2018 and 2019, we acquired wholesale building material distribution locations in Nashville, Tennessee; Medford, Oregon; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Birmingham, Alabama. In addition, we opened a new distribution center in St. Louis, Missouri, during 2017. 

Leverage our Integrated Model
    We believe our vertically-integrated business model provides us with advantages over less integrated competitors and provides unique and significant value to our customers. Wood Products enjoys superior access to the market through a committed distributor, BMD benefits from a committed manufacturing partnership, and we capture margin at both levels of the supply chain. From 2017 to 2021, Wood Products sales volumes of EWP to BMD grew from 71% to 78%, and plywood sales volumes to BMD declined slightly from 31% to 28%. The chart below reflects the progress we have made in distributing internally produced products through our distribution network.
Drive Operational Excellence
    In Wood Products, we use process improvement and machine reliability methodologies to continuously refine and improve our operations and processes. We believe there are opportunities to further apply these process improvement programs in our manufacturing operations and apply similar techniques and methods to different functional areas to realize efficiencies in those areas. 
    In BMD, we believe our highly efficient logistics system allows us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital. In order to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, we regularly capture and report upon a wide variety of investment, operational, and customer service metrics. Key learnings and best practices are then leveraged across our distribution locations. 
Accelerate Pace of Innovation, Digital Technology, and Diversity & Inclusion
    The Company is actively pursuing additional initiatives that we believe will provide further avenues for revenue and earnings growth:
    Innovation - We are actively engaged in product development opportunities in our Wood Products segment. These opportunities include the development of new products for new residential construction or commercial construction applications. The commercial construction segment is a particular area of focus for us given we have limited penetration in that space today, and recent changes in building codes that allow for the use of mass timber in tall wood structures provide further opportunity. Innovation efforts within our Wood Products segment are also focused on identifying process and cost efficiency improvement opportunities, some of which will include further automation within our manufacturing operations. To support our innovation initiatives, we have added dedicated resources and are also leveraging tools to capture ideas from associates across our organization. 

Digital Technology - Like many companies, we use multiple systems to manage our business. This can mean that critical business data is not in one central and easily accessible location. As such, we have undertaken a project that will bring much of our primary business data into a single repository that, when combined with a robust reporting engine, will allow us to quickly access and analyze the information. Ultimately, we expect the project to result in the development of business use cases that will provide revenue generating, cost reducing, and risk mitigating opportunities.
    Diversity & Inclusion - In alignment with our core values, we strive to cultivate a climate of mutual respect, camaraderie, and teamwork. We welcome diverse backgrounds, views, and skills because we believe it results in stronger teams, inspired solutions, greater agility as an organization, and ultimately a more sustainable and profitable business model over time. At the same time, we also recognize that shifting demographics, a changing talent market, and a competitive business environment make a compelling case for us to be even more intentional in creating a diverse and inclusive work environment. As such, we have hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion, supported by our executive leadership team and a steering committee composed of associates from across the Company. Our ongoing efforts have placed additional focus on diversity and inclusion to develop an iterative framework of education and training, strategy development, and implementation that will be shared with all levels of our organization. 
Segment Detail
Wood Products 
Products
     LVL and laminated beams are structural products used in applications where extra strength and consistent quality are required, such as headers and beams. LVL is also used in the manufacture of I-joists, which are assembled by combining a vertical web of OSB with top and bottom LVL or solid wood flanges. I-joists, which are used primarily in residential and commercial flooring and roofing systems and other structural applications, are stronger, lighter, and straighter than conventional lumber joists. Plywood is used in a wide range of structural, interior, and exterior applications within the residential, industrial, and repair and remodel sectors. We also produce ponderosa pine shop lumber which is sold primarily to industrial converters, and ponderosa pine appearance grade boards that are sold to home centers and dealers. 
    The following table sets forth the annual capacity, production volumes, and sales volumes of our principal products for the periods indicated:

    The following table sets forth segment sales, segment income (loss), depreciation and amortization, and EBITDA for the periods indicated: 

 | Year Ended December 31
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017
 | (millions) 
Segment sales (a) | $ | 1,970.8 | | | $ | 1,323.9 | | $ | 1,275.2 | $ | 1,533.3 | $ | 1,373.8

Segment EBITDA (b) (d) | $ | 586.5 | | | $ | 198.9 | | $ | 111.9 | $ | 117.0 | $ | 116.7 

_______________________________________ 
(a)    Segment sales are calculated before elimination of sales to our BMD segment.
(b)    During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $11.5 million related to the sale of two lumber mills and a particleboard plant in Northeast Oregon, as well as a pre-tax impairment loss of $24.0 million on the Moncure plywood facility upon being classified as held for sale. 
(c)    The year ended December 31, 2018 includes $55.0 million of accelerated depreciation, $2.6 million of construction in progress and spare parts write-offs, and $0.2 million of severance expenses related to the Roxboro LVL curtailment in November 2018. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $15.0 million of accelerated depreciation and $1.7 million of other closure costs related to the Roxboro I-joist curtailment in March 2020. For additional information regarding the Roxboro I-joist production curtailment, see Note 6, Curtailment of Manufacturing Facility, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
(d)    Segment EBITDA is calculated as segment income before depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA as income before interest (interest expense and interest income), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it presents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and identify strategies to improve operating performance. We also believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and our Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that is used by our management and because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties when comparing companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates. EBITDA, however, is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of EBITDA instead of net income or segment income (loss) has limitations as analytical tools, including the inability to determine profitability; the exclusion of interest expense, interest income, and associated significant cash requirements; and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent unavoidable operating costs. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results. Our measure of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation.
Facilities 
    Our Wood Products segment operates five EWP facilities. Our two most significant EWP facilities are located in Louisiana and Oregon and have a high degree of raw material and manufacturing integration with our neighboring plywood and veneer facilities. We also operate eight plywood and veneer plants, as well as two sawmills. 
Raw Materials and Input Costs
Wood fiber. Wood fiber is the primary raw material used in our Wood Products operations, and our primary source of wood fiber is logs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, wood fiber accounted for approximately 45% of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) in our Wood Products segment. Our EWP facilities use parallel-laminated veneer panels and veneer sheets produced by our facilities, as well as lumber, OSB, and veneer sheets purchased from third parties, to manufacture LVL, I-joists, and laminated beams. Our EWP, plywood, and veneer facilities use Douglas fir, white woods, and pine logs as raw materials. Our manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to active wood fiber markets. 
Logs comprised approximately 66% of our wood fiber costs during 2021, and we satisfy our log requirements through a combination of purchases under supply agreements, open-market purchases, and purchases pursuant to contracts awarded under public auctions.
Approximately 84% of our log supply in 2021 was supplied through purchases from private landowners or through dealers. We also bid in auctions conducted by federal, state, and local authorities for the purchase of logs, generally at fixed prices, under contracts with terms of generally one to three years. 
Our log requirements and our access to supply, as well as the cost of obtaining logs, are subject to change based on, among other things, the availability of logs in each of our operating areas, our operating schedules, competition from other manufacturers, the effect of governmental laws and regulations, impacts of weather or fire on log availability, and the status of environmental appeals. Per-unit log costs in the western U.S. are higher than per-unit log costs in the southern U.S. due to higher harvest and delivery costs, as well as various supply-side constraints, including seasonal weather-related restrictions, slower growth cycles, and a higher proportion of federal and state timberland ownership. Our aggregate cost of obtaining logs is also affected by fuel costs and the distance of the log source from our facilities, as we are often required to arrange for harvesting and delivery of the logs we purchase from the source to our facilities. For a discussion of contractual commitments relating to log supply agreements, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K.
           We also purchase OSB, which is used as the vertical web to assemble I-joists. OSB accounted for approximately 9% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) for our Wood Products segment in 2021. OSB is a commodity, and prices have been historically volatile in response to industry capacity and operating rates, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns. 
    Wood fiber also includes, to a lesser extent than OSB, lumber purchased from third parties for I-joist production at our Canadian EWP facility and for production at our laminated beam plant in Idaho. Lumber input costs are subject to similar commodity-based volatility characteristics noted above for OSB. 
Other raw materials and energy costs. We use a significant quantity of various resins and glues in our manufacturing processes. Resin and glue product costs are influenced by changes in the prices of raw material input costs, primarily fossil fuel products. We purchase resins and glues, other raw materials, and energy used to manufacture our products in both the open market and through supply contracts. The contracts are generally with regional suppliers who agree to supply all of our needs for a certain raw material or energy within the applicable region. These contracts have terms of various lengths and typically contain price adjustment mechanisms that take into account changes in market prices. 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
     Our EWP sales force is managed centrally through a main office that oversees regional sales teams. Our sales force spends a significant amount of time working with end customers who purchase our EWP. Our sales force provides a variety of technical support services, including integrated design, engineering, product specification software, distributor inventory management software, and job-pack preparation systems. Sales of plywood are managed centrally from our headquarters. 
    In 2021, EWP and plywood accounted for 51% and 40%, respectively, of our Wood Products sales. The majority of our wood products are sold to leading wholesalers (including our BMD segment), home improvement centers, dealers, and industrial converters in North America. Our BMD segment is our Wood Products segment's largest customer, representing approximately 62% of our Wood Products segment's overall sales in 2021. In 2021, 78% and 28% of our Wood Products segment's EWP and plywood sales volumes, respectively, were to our BMD segment. 
Building Materials Distribution 
Products 
    We sell a broad line of building materials; including OSB, plywood, and lumber (collectively commodities), general line items such as siding, composite decking, doors, metal products, insulation, and roofing, and EWP. Except for EWP, we purchase most of these building materials from a broad base of third-party suppliers ranging from large manufacturers, such as Huber Engineered Woods, James Hardie Building Products, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Trex Company, and Therma-Tru Corporation, to small regional producers. Substantially all of our EWP is sourced from our Wood Products segment. Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair-and-remodeling of existing housing, the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings, and other industrial applications. 
    The following table lists our product line sales mix for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
 | (percentage of Building Materials Distribution sales)
Commodity | 51.6 | % | | 46.6 | % | 41.7 | % | | 48.3 | % | 47.9 | %
General line | 30.2 | % | | 35.6 | % | 38.2 | % | | 33.1 | % | 33.6 | %
Engineered wood products | 18.2 | % | | 17.8 | % | 20.1 | % | | 18.6 | % | 18.5 | %

    The following table sets forth segment sales, income, depreciation and amortization, and EBITDA for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017
 | (millions) 
Segment sales | $ | 7,174.3 | | | $ | 4,952.0 | | $ | 4,137.7 | $ | 4,287.7 | $ | 3,773.8
Segment income | $ | 481.1 | | | $ | 247.5 | | $ | 116.2 | $ | 112.5 | $ | 116.8 
Segment depreciation and amortization | 24.0 | | | 22.5 | | | 20.8 | | 18.3 | 15.5 | 
Segment EBITDA (a) | $ | 505.1 | | | $ | 270.0 | | $ | 137.0 | $ | 130.8 | $ | 132.3 

_______________________________________ 
(a)    Segment EBITDA is calculated as segment income before depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA as income before interest (interest expense and interest income), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it presents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and identify strategies to improve operating performance. We also believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and our Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that is used by our management and because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties when comparing companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates. EBITDA, however, is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of EBITDA instead of net income or segment income (loss) has limitations as analytical tools, including the inability to determine profitability; the exclusion of interest expense, interest income, and associated significant cash requirements; and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent unavoidable operating costs. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results. Our measure of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation.
Facilities 
Our BMD segment operates a nationwide network of 38 building materials distribution facilities throughout the U.S. and also operates a single component manufacturing plant. Our broad geographic presence reduces our exposure to market factors in any single region. During 2018 and 2019, we acquired wholesale building material distribution locations in Nashville, Tennessee; Medford, Oregon; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Birmingham, Alabama. These locations complemented our existing distribution business and strengthened our nationwide presence, and we have been able to broaden our product and service offerings within each of these markets. For further discussion on acquisitions, see Note 7, Acquisitions, of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10‑K.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
We market our building materials primarily to dealers, home improvement centers, and specialty distributors that then sell the products to end customers, who are typically homebuilders, independent contractors, and homeowners engaged in residential construction and repair-and-remodeling projects. We also market our products to a wide variety of industrial accounts, which use our products to assemble cabinets, doors, agricultural bins, crating, and other products used in industrial and construction applications. 
We believe that our national presence and long-standing relationships with many of our key suppliers allow us to obtain favorable price and term arrangements and offer excellent customer service on leading brands in the building materials industry. We also believe our broad product line provides our customers with an efficient, one-stop resource for their building materials needs. We also have expertise in special-order sourcing and merchandising support, which is a key service for our home improvement center customers that choose not to stock certain items in inventory.
We sell products through two primary distribution channels: warehouse sales and direct sales. Warehouse sales are delivered from our distribution centers to our customers and direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without us taking physical possession of inventory. Each of our distribution centers implements its own distribution and logistics model using centralized information systems. We use internal and external trucking resources to deliver materials on a regularly scheduled basis. Our highly efficient logistics system allows us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital.
We have a large, decentralized sales force to support our suppliers and customers. Our sales force and product managers have local product knowledge and decision-making authority, which we believe enables them to optimize stocking, pricing, and product assortment decisions. Our sales force has access to centralized information technology systems, an extensive vendor base, and corporate-level working capital support, which we believe complements our localized sales model. 
We regularly evaluate opportunities to introduce new products. Broadening our product offering helps us serve as a one-stop resource for building materials, which we believe improves our customers' purchasing and operating efficiencies. The introduction of new products is primarily driven by customer demand or product extensions originating from our vendors. We believe our long-standing customer and vendor relationships allow us to respond to customer feedback and introduce new products more rapidly. Broadening our product offering also helps us drive additional products through our distribution system, thereby increasing our scale and efficiency. 
Customers
Our customer relationships range from locally owned single-location facilities to the largest national home improvement center and dealers across the U.S., with Builders FirstSource and Home Depot being our largest customers. Substantially all sales to Builders FirstSource were recorded in our BMD segment, and sales to Home Depot were recorded in our BMD and Wood Products segments. For additional information related to customers of our Wood Products and BMD segments, see the "Sales, Marketing, and Distribution" sections above.
Competition 
Wood Products. The wood products manufacturing markets in which we operate are large and highly competitive. In EWP, we compete against several major North American EWP producers, such as Weyerhaeuser Company, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, and Roseburg Forest Products, as well as several other smaller firms. Our EWP products also face competition from numerous dimension lumber producers, because EWP may be substituted by dimension lumber in many building applications. In plywood, we compete with Georgia-Pacific, the largest manufacturer in North America, other large producers such as Roseburg Forest Products, foreign imports produced principally in South America, and several smaller domestic producers. Our plywood products also face competition from OSB producers, because OSB can be substituted for plywood in many building and industrial applications. We have leading market positions in the manufacture of EWP and plywood. In the wood products manufacturing markets, we compete primarily on the basis of price, quality, availability, and particularly with respect to EWP, customer service, product support, and performance features offered. Most of our competitors are located in the U.S. and Canada, although we also compete with manufacturers in other countries, particularly when the U.S. dollar and economy are stronger relative to other countries, encouraging foreign producers to sell more of their plywood into the U.S. 

Building Materials Distribution. The building materials distribution markets in which we operate are highly fragmented, and we compete in each of our geographic and product markets with national, regional, and local distributors. Our wholesale distribution competitors include BlueLinx Holdings Inc., Specialty Building Products Inc., Weyerhaeuser Company, Dixie Plywood and Lumber, OrePac, U.S. Lumber Group, Huttig Building Products, and Capital Lumber, among others. We also compete with wholesale brokers, specialty distributors, and certain buying cooperatives. We compete on the basis of pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist customers with problem solving, extension of credit terms, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. We distribute products for some manufacturers that also engage in direct sales to our distribution customers. Proximity to customers is also an important factor in minimizing shipping costs and facilitating quick order turnaround and on-time delivery. We believe our ability to obtain quality materials, from both internal and external sources, the scale and efficiency of our national footprint, and our focus on customer service are our primary competitive advantages in this segment. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors and allows for more favorable terms on which we are able to obtain products from our suppliers and sell to our customers.
    We also present information pertaining to our segments, including product sales and customer concentration, in Note 16, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 
Human Capital Management
Human capital management and our ability to attract, develop and retain talent that embraces our shared values of integrity, safety, respect, and pursuit of excellence have been and will continue to be critical to executing our previously described strategic objectives. 
At Boise Cascade, the health and safety of our 6,110 associates is core to how we do business. We collect and report common lagging indicators of safety performance, and our safety programs include tools, training, and resources that allow us to collect, analyze, and share leading indicators of safety-related hazards broadly across our organization. We believe that our focus on leading indicators helps to prevent future incidents and injuries. Living our values means driving the expectation that each of our associates has ownership in safety and the authority to stop work if there is a safety concern. Our safety commitment extends to minimizing the spread and reducing the severity of COVID-19, including educating our associates on the effectiveness of vaccines and strongly encouraging vaccination for its long-term health benefits.
