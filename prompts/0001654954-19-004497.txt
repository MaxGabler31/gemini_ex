 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Corporate History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 5, 2007. Effective June 15, 2011, we completed a merger with our subsidiary, Titan Iron Ore Corp., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name to “Titan Iron Ore Corp.”
  
 As of December 31, 2013, Titan Iron Ore Corp. was a mineral exploration company. Due to our inability to raise capital to further develop mining claims and pursue mineral exploration, we decided to exit the mining business and look for other opportunities.
  
 On February 3, 2014, we completed a merger with iHookup Social, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“iHookup”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) dated January 31, 2014. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we incorporated a new subsidiary called iHookup Operations Corp, a Delaware corporation, which merged with and into iHookup, causing the subsidiary’s separate existence to cease and iHookup to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. iHookup’s stockholders exchanged all of their twelve million (12,000,000) shares of outstanding common stock for fifty million (50,000,000) shares of the Company’s newly designated Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the stockholders.  The holders of preferred stock are entitled to cast votes equal to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible. The total aggregate issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any given time regardless of their number shall be convertible into the number of shares of common stock which equals nine (9) times the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding at the time of any conversion, at the option of the preferred holders or until the closing of a Qualified Financing (i.e. the sale and issuance of our equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $2,500,000) at one time or in the same round. As a result of the transaction, the former Friendable stockholders received a controlling interest in the Company due to the voting rights of the Series A Preferred Stock being connected to their super-majority conversion rights.
  
 On April 29, 2014, FINRA approved a 20 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 937,459,274 shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 46,872,964 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On March 19, 2015, FINRA approved a 100 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 2,355,489,991, shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 23,554,923 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On October 26, 2015, the Company issued a press release announcing that FINRA had approved a change to our trading symbol for our common stock which is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace. Effective October 27, 2015 our trading symbol was changed from “HKUP” to “FDBL”. This change was made in conjunction with the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Amendment on September 28, 2015 to its Articles of Incorporation changing the name of the Company from “iHookup Social, Inc.” to “Friendable, Inc.” The company had previously announced a re-branding our app from "iHookup Social" to "Friendable". As a result, the Company desired to change its name to match the rebranding so as to be more specific to the Company’s core values and its products/services, creating a more recognizable brand that creates less confusion.
  
 On May 31, 2017, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation increasing the authorized common stock from 10,000,000,000 to 15,000,000,000 shares. On June 28, 2017, the Company incorporated a subsidiary, Fan Pass, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated to undertake the development of the mobile application “The Fan Pass App”.

  About Friendable, Inc.
  
  Friendable, Inc. is a mobile focused technology and marketing company, connecting and engaging users through two distinctly branded applications:
  
  The Friendable and Fan Pass Mobile Applications.
  
 The Company initially released its flagship product Friendable, as a social application where users can create one-on-one or group-style meetups. In 2019 the Company released its new version of Friendable with a focus on dating and building subscription based revenue, starting with its existing and historical database of approximately 900,000 registered users.
  
 Fan Pass is the Company’s newest app/brand and wholly owned subsidiary, scheduled for release in 2019. Fan Pass believes in connecting Fans of their favorite celebrity or artist, to an exclusive VIP or Backstage experience, right from their smart phone or other connected devices. Fan Pass allows an artist fan base to experience something they would otherwise never have the opportunity to afford or geographically attend. The Company aims to establish both Friendable and Fan Pass as premier brands and mobile platforms that are dedicated to connecting and engaging users from anywhere around the World.
  
  Mobile Applications
  
  Introduction
  
  The Friendable Mobile Application:
  
 
  Friendable’s platform is a location-based social platform which creates a “Subscription” based opportunity and location-based advertising for Brands and Businesses. Friendable is marketed as a friendly non-threatening environment for everyone with a "friends-first" approach to making new connections and where everything starts with friendship. The company plans to continue upgrading its application & acquire new registered users and subscribers to increase revenue, engagement and overall # of monthly active users (MAU).
 
  In January 2019, the Company released a brand new ground up version of the friendable application which is to focus on generating subscription based revenue. Based on several factors which included the reliance on outdated software and ongoing neggiations to reduce the company’s debt, the Company purged all legacy users. In doing so, the Company will rely upon aqcuiring new users and marketing to the prior legacy database in an attempt to convert them into active, paying subscribers.
 
  The Friendable application has undergone several versions over the past 5 years and has historically accomplished the following:
  
   -

 Historically, Friendable’s apps have been downloaded total over 1.5 million times across iOS and Android.
  
 Management believes that its Friendable application is in need of additional feature set upgrades, expansion and intelligent technology integration to stay competitive in the Social Networking / Dating category and will continue on this path while developing and launching Fan Pass. Management believes that the cross promotion of Fan Pass users to the Friendable application will allow us to acquire Friendable subscribers at much lower cost than if acquiring users through its own marketing directives.
  The Fan Pass Live Application (Development Stage)
 
 
 In 2019, the Company partnered with Vimeo, Inc to develop and release its Fan Pass mobile application for commercial release on its Vimeo OTT / Livestream platform for iPhone, Android, Apple TV, Android TV, and Roku.

 In addition, fans will be able to subscribe and view all livestream and on-demand archived videos; or subscribe to an individual broadcast instead. We believe that, especially for a large event like a music festival or concert, the option for fans to briefly purchase a broadcast or view an older broadcast increases the likelihood of added subscriptions.
  
 For artists, Fan Pass will offer several levels of revenue-sharing with them and their agencies. Each artist will be asked to market their Fan Pass channel to their social followers and fans, ultimately generating subscription revenue for the Company. The revenue-sharing ecosystem is designed to help celebrities monetize their fans and followers at fairer rates compared to other video streaming applications; Fan Pass will be able to be used in conjunction with other video applications to bolster their income. Lastly, Fan Pass will offer video production and recording services for artists if they do not want to record their own streams.
  
  Fan Pass believe's in connecting fans globally..to an exclusive backstage experience, right from their smartphone!

  Market Opportunity
   Market Overview: Fan Pass
  
  As our digital age continues to evolve, today we see the creation of a new type of end-user: the ever-present “Omni-user” with an overwhelming appetite for content. These people are an emerging class of knowledgeable users that demand constant access to content, people and celebrities they follow, from work to play or from home, anywhere in the world. Fan Pass was created to satisfy the needs of these omni-users. It is only in the last five years that technology and social media have evolved to a point that allows Fan Pass to become a disruptive opportunity.
  
  Consider these facts; Less than a dozen years ago the first mobile phone was invented. Only five years ago, mobile devices started to become less annoying and more useful. It has taken these last five years for processors to become fast, displays to become large and clear, storage to become easily available, and cellular and Wi-Fi networks to be “Omni-present” making mobile devices a useful and always present, necessity in life. At the same time, social media networks have had time to grow strong, reliable and also “Omni-present” thus allowing celebrities and influencers to build vast armies of Fans or “Social Followers”.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 In addition to owning the Friendable name, brand, and trademark, the Company has applied for and been granted protection (copyright & trademark) on the Fan Pass name, logo and brand. The Company also intends, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions. We regard our intellectual property, including our software and trademark, as valuable assets and intend to vigorously defend them against infringement. 
  
 While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to file for protection and assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our Company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is an important part of our operating strategy.
  
  Employees and Key Consultants
  
 The Company has three full time employees and a variety of partners that serve in various consulting capacities based on the Company’s specific needs.
