ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an early stage medical cannabis research and development company that applies conventional pharmaceutical research protocols and disciplines to the field of medical cannabis with the objective of establishing a leadership position in the research and development of medical cannabis therapies, products and delivery technologies. We are currently engaged in the research and development and have conducted trials on the efficacy of cannabis-based medical products (the “Cannabis-Based Medical Products”) commencing with our cannabis-based topical ointment for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, we also are pursuing the use of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products for the treatment of multiple myeloma, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), chronic pain and fibromyalgia, and have made significant advancements in the development of a cannabis soluble tablet delivery system that could have applications for other indications. We are also capable of providing consulting and advisory services to governmental and private entities to assist them with developing and implementing tailor-made, comprehensive medical cannabis programs, although we have not generated any revenues from such services to date.
 
We have been engaged in research and development and consulting and advisory activities through our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, One World Cannabis Ltd., since July 2014. To date, we have entered into binding agreements with major hospitals and medical research facilities in Israel for the purpose of conducting research studies and trials related to the development and use of Cannabis-Based Medical Products for the treatment of multiple myeloma, psoriasis, PTSD, chronic pain and fibromyalgia, and for the development of a cannabis soluble tablet delivery system.
 
On January 29, 2019 we reported positive Phase 1 safety data for our medical grade cannabis MGC ointment for the treatment of skin diseases. No severe adverse events were observed in the trial.
 
Skin cells in patients with psoriasis grow at an abnormally fast rate, causing a buildup of lesions that tend to burn and itch. While the real cause of psoriasis is not known, genetics are believed to play a major role in its development. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, psoriasis affects approximately 3% of the world’s population and 7.5 million people in the United States.
 
History and Former Operations
 
In 2008, we acquired a patent relating to our electromagnetic percussion device (the “Device”). In March 2013, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with GUMI Tel Aviv Ltd. (“GUMI”), a technology company engaged in the manufacture and sale of industrial equipment, to develop, manufacture and market the Device. To date, we have not derived any revenues from GUMI’s marketing efforts. We abandoned this line of business in 2015 and in February 2016 terminated our agreement with GUMI, executing mutual general releases.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on March 7, 2008 under the name Dynamic Applications Corp. We changed our name to OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. on December 9, 2014. We formed our wholly owned subsidiary One World Cannabis Ltd in Israel on July 6, 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 2 Ben Gurion St. Ramat Gan, Israel 5257334 and our telephone number is 972 (0) 72-260-8004.

● | Understanding governmental regulation is a prerequisite for success in our industry and our team has substantial knowledge and experience with respect to the rules of drug development and medical cannabis programs; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our scientific team has many years of experience in diverse but relevant disciplines, including medical research and regulatory affairs, as well as extensive cannabis-related issues experience. 

Our Research and Development Activities
 
Our research and development activities continue to be focused primarily on exploring several formulations containing active compounds from the cannabis plant, including but not limited to the cannabinoids cannabidiol (“CBD”) and cannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), and identifying potential therapeutic applications of based on the synergistic effects of these active compounds. The synergistic contributions of our formulations have not been scientifically researched and demonstrated and is currently being investigated in a preclinical model concerning our topical ointment formulation. We aim to standardize the formulations across the extracts as a whole, not simply by reference to their key active components (CBD and/or THC). In addition, we are developing unique delivery systems for our pharmaceutical grade products.
 
Our goal is to become a leader in the research and development of cannabis-based medical drugs and treatments. Since 2014, our focus has been on researching and developing cannabis-based formulations for the treatment of multiple myeloma, psoriasis, PTSD, chronic pain and fibromyalgia, as well as developing a cannabis soluble tablet delivery system. We believe a significant need remains for novel oral and safe drugs for patients who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies are unsuitable. Our research and development is focused primarily on exploring several formulations containing active compounds from the cannabis plant, including, but not limited to, the CBD and THC, and identifying potential therapeutic applications of synergistic effects of these active compounds. The synergistic contributions of our formulations have not yet been fully-researched and scientifically demonstrated and that is the purpose of the studies and trials we have been conducting in collaboration with major Israeli health institutions, which is discussed more fully below.
 
We aim to standardize the formulations of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products across the extracts as a whole, not simply by reference to their key active components (CBD and/or THC). Although there are existing reports and studies on CBD and THC, our formulations upon completion are expected to possibly contain several additional active compounds from the cannabis plant that have not been as well studied to date by others. Our formulations must be fully-researched and documented in order to verify their efficacy at treating indications, appropriate dosage levels and appropriate methods of administration. We believe we will continue to experience promising results through our research and development activities and intend to produce pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid-based products and treatments, which are standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate and efficient delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $712,000 and $441,000 on research and development, respectively.
 
Our research is led by internationally renowned investigators at the facilities of leading Israeli hospitals and scientific institutions. Dr. Yehuda Baruch, our Chief Medical and Regulatory Affairs Officer, Dr. Oron Yacoby Zeevi, our Chief Science Officer, and Alon Sinai, our Chief Operating Officer, will monitor our studies. Our team of specialists also includes Dr. Yuval Ramot (psoriasis specialist), Ms. Miri Sani, our regulatory adviser, Dr. Sharon Rozenblat, and Dan Segal (intellectual property advisor), Dr. Sharon Rozenblat one of our Senior Science Advisors to our Scientific Advisory Board. We will adhere to all applicable legislation, rules and guidelines regarding our studies and investigations.
 
We acquire the cannabis needed for our research activities from G.K. Medical Cannabis Ltd, Canndoc Ltd, Seach Ltd or IMC Medical Cannabis Ltd, all government-licensed Israeli medical cannabis growers.
 
Our Studies and Trials
 
To date, we have entered into separate research collaboration and license agreements (each a “Sheba Agreement,” and together, the “Sheba Agreements”) as well as service agreements with Sheba, with respect to two potential indications. Sheba is a university-affiliated hospital that serves as Israel’s national medical center and is one of the leading integrated medical centers in the Middle East. Within the framework of our research and collaboration agreements with Sheba, we have initiated two studies at the Sheba facilities to explore the effect of two formulations, each based on active ingredients in the cannabis extracts, on multiple myeloma and psoriasis.

Our Clinical Trial on Psoriasis
 
Under the Sheba Agreement relating to the clinical trial of certain treatments of psoriasis (the “Psoriasis Research Agreement”), Sheba performed a Phase I, placebo controlled, maximal dose trial (the “Psoriasis Trial”) to determine the safety and tolerability of topical ointment containing medical grade cannabis (“MGC” or the “Topical Ointment”) in healthy volunteers, employing the services of Professor Aviv Barzilai, Director of the Department of Dermatology at Chaim Sheba Medical Center, to lead the Psoriasis Trial (the “Investigator”). The Psoriasis Trial was conducted in compliance with a number of protocols, instructions and guidelines outlined in the Psoriasis Research Agreement, including, but not limited to the following: Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines, instructions and terms identified by the Helsinki Committee in their approval of the Psoriasis Trial, the Central Israeli IRB; and the applicable laws, rules and regulations regulating such trials which are applicable in Israel.
 
On February 1, 2017, following the encouraging pre-clinical results that we achieved at the mid-point of the psoriasis-related study conducted by us with the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center (“Dead Sea”), we were determined to extend the size and scope of the study for the purpose, among other parameters, of checking the biological markers to extend the size and scope of the study for the purpose, among other parameters, of checking the biological markers that have been generated to date with respect to the treatment of psoriasis (proliferation/inhibition and several interleukins) which was conducted by such institute. Such trial results concluded that application of our unique active cannabinoid-based Topical Ointment formulation, indicated foremost improvement in a variety of inflammation markers directly associated with Psoriasis and inhibition of proliferation.
 
On March 20, 2017, we announced the promising preliminary results from the pre-clinical efficacy testing of our Topical Ointment, reporting significant reduction of several inflammation markers specific to psoriasis. We anticipated that the Topical Ointment will be market-ready during the second fiscal quarter of 2018 and, subject to regulatory approvals from applicable jurisdictions and the Psoriasis Study completion, the Topical Ointment should be available for use by those who suffer from psoriasis in the near term. We expect to complete the Phase I study for the Topical Ointment in the near term and to start looking for strategic partners in different countries upon completion.
 
On April 5, 2017, we announced that as a result of the promising preliminary results from the pre-clinical efficacy testing of our Topical Ointment, reporting significant reduction of several inflammation markers specific to psoriasis, we have received expressions of scientific and medical interest, world-wide, for our Topical Ointment. We expanded the size and scope of our clinical trials and, as previously announced, anticipated that subject to pending regulatory approvals from applicable jurisdictions, our Topical Ointment could be available for use by those who suffer from psoriasis in the near term.
 
On June 28, 2018, we announced the successful completion of the first part of our Psoriasis Trial to determine the safety and tolerability of the Topical Ointment in healthy volunteers. The completed part of our Psoriasis Trial consisted of application of escalating doses of the Topical Ointment to healthy volunteers and was successfully completed with no adverse effects. After the completion of the second part of our Psoriasis trial, we plan to initiate a Phase II Trial to demonstrate the efficacy of the Topical Ointment in treating mild to moderate psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases.
 
Pursuant to the Psoriasis Research Agreement, we were obliged to pay Sheba $170,000 throughout 2017 and 2018 for conducting the Psoriasis Trial. As of December 31, 2018, we have paid Sheba $129,000.
 
On January 29, 2019 we reported positive Phase 1 safety data for our medical grade cannabis MGC ointment for the treatment of skin diseases. No severe adverse events were observed in the trial.
 
This Phase 1 Psoriasis Trial was a single center, prospective, placebo-controlled, trial to assess the safety and tolerability of topical MGC ointment (3% CBD, 3% THC) in healthy subjects. The Psoriasis Trial was conducted at Sheba between September 2017 when the first subject entered the Psoriasis Trial and January 2019 when the last subjected completed the Psoriasis Trial.
 
The Psoriasis Trial was divided into two stages:
 
Stage I was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability following a single dose application of MGC ointment in 26 healthy volunteers. Subjects were hospitalized and monitored for 24 hours. Stage 2 was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated applications of MGC topical ointment in healthy volunteers over a six week period. A total of 20 healthy subjects (13 subjects that participated in stage I and 7 newly recruited subjects) participated in this stage. MGC ointment treatment was applied by the subjects themselves, at home, twice daily. Subjects were asked to apply MGC ointment (daily dose of 30 mg CBD: 30 mg THC) on one arm and a placebo ointment (vehicle only) on the other arm. Investigators were blinded as to the type of treatment that was applied to each arm.

We expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of MGC ointment for the treatment of psoriasis during the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
Our Study on Multiple Myeloma
 
Under the Sheba Agreement relating to the multiple Myeloma (the “Multiple Myeloma Service Agreement”), we have conducted pre-clinical studies in known (commercial) cell lines and cell cultures from known patients and their response to treatment with various cannabis extracts (different ratios of THC/CBD) and their therapeutic response with and without various known drugs used to treat multiple myeloma patients (the “Multiple Myeloma Study”).
 
Dr. Merav Leiba, Former Head of Multiple Myeloma Outpatient Clinic and Multiple Myeloma Research Lab at Sheba’s Hematology Institute, led the in vitro tests on multiple myeloma. Dr. Leiba, a specialist in Internal Medicine and Hematology, was a postdoctoral fellow at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Leiba has participated in numerous clinical and investigational studies aimed at developing novel drugs for multiple myeloma.
 
Our test results on multiple myeloma cells studied in vitro, led us to proceed with further pre-clinical studies of our formulation on cell cultures taken from patients, to assess the scientific merit for further development as an investigational new drug. While we are encouraged by the results of the limited in vitro tests, there can be no assurance that any clinical trial will result in commercially viable products or treatments.
 
We intend to continue our testing and study of our cannabinoid-based therapies on the treatment of multiple myeloma.
 
The next phase of the Multiple Myeloma Study, which is based upon the promising results of our earlier in-vitro studies of our unique formula of cannabinoid-based therapies targeting cells, is to investigate the doses and diverse delivery systems to best determine the most effective dosages for the future planned phases of the Multiple Myeloma Study on human patients, pending receipt of regulatory approvals. We completed a preclinical phase of the Multiple Myeloma Study during the third fiscal quarter of 2017. The next steps of the Multiple Myeloma Study are subject to sufficient capital or additional funding.
 
The Multiple Myeloma Study was designed to pursue and secure orphan designation status from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and will hopefully open ways to improve the quality of life of multiple myeloma patients while at the same time potentially enhance response to various multiple myeloma treatment regimes.
 
On October 22, 2018, we announced that our newly developed, highly concentrated, delivery formulation, OWC-1808, was administered in vivo in an animal model for the first time and was found to be safe and tolerable. This formulation will allow the delivery of very high doses of CBD and THC with exceptional bioavailability. The continued development and testing of this formulation will be directed initially at OWC’s ongoing program for treating Multiple Myeloma.
 
Pursuant to the Multiple Myeloma Service Agreement, we were expected to pay Sheba $170,000 for conducting the Multiple Myeloma Study between the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we have paid Sheba $66,000.
 
Our Clinical Trial of a Cannabis Soluble Tablet Delivery System
 
On December 20, 2017, we announced that we received a new permit from the Israel Medical Cannabis Agency (the “IMCA”) to proceed with the safety clinical trial of our cannabis soluble tablet delivery system (the “Tablet Trial”). The Tablet Trial protocol has been submitted and approved by the IRB at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (“Sourasky”). On March 28, 2018, we received the approval by the central IRB to conduct the safety Tablet Trial of our cannabis soluble tablet delivery system.
 
On June 13, 2018 we announced the completion of the pre-clinical development of our next generation, orally-disintegrating tablet containing cannabis extract with specific amounts of the cannabinoids THC and CBD. The tablet is targeted at different indications and will be available in various ratios of THC to CBD and various doses of active ingredients.

The tablet will be indicated as a substitute for patients being treated with medical cannabis by smoking. Key indications will include chronic pain syndromes and Fibromyalgia, inter alia. Key advantages of this delivery form over smoking medical cannabis are metered and controlled dosage, fast and effective absorption (disintegration time of the tablet is less than 2 minutes) and ease of use with no hazardous smoke inhalation or adverse environmental effects or issues of passive smoking. The ability to manufacture a tablet under strict quality control and quality assurance standards is intrinsic to this dosage form and to the establishment of strict clinical standards.
 
In January 2019, we entered into a clinical trial agreement (the “Clinical Trial Agreement”) with the Sourasky Medical Center Fund (the “Fund”) in Tel Aviv for performing a single-dose, randomized, crossover Tablet Trial to compare the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of OWC’s Medical Grade Cannabis - Orally Disintegrating Tablets (MGC-ODT) with Buccal Sativex®, in healthy adult volunteers. This Clinical Trial Agreement is between One World Cannabis Ltd. and The Medical, Infrastructure and Health Services Fund of the Tel Aviv Medical Center, Israel, and Prof. Jacob Ablin M.D. as the Principal Investigator.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. We, as well as the regulatory authorities in Israel and elsewhere, such as an IRB committee), the IMCA, or the FDA, may suspend, delay or terminate our clinical trials at any time, may require us, for various reasons, to conduct additional clinical trials, or may require a particular clinical trial to continue for a longer duration than originally planned, including, among others:

● | lack of effectiveness of any formulation or delivery system during clinical trials; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues; 
● | slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials; 
● | delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints; 
● | delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial, including IRB approvals, licenses required for obtaining and using cannabis for research, either before or after a trial is commenced; 
● | unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
● | patients or investigators failing to comply with study protocols; 
● | patients failing to return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate; 
● | sites participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites; 
● | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or act in ways inconsistent with the established investigator agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices, and other IRB requirements; 
● | third-party entities do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or at all; 
● | regulatory inspections of our clinical studies require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies; 

 
Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
At present, we use our available working capital to fund these studies and trials. However, we expect that we will need to raise additional funding prior to or when our clinical studies are commenced.

We have not yet commenced any significant activities related to our third-party consulting services.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Psoriasis
 
Psoriasis is manifested by scaly plaques on the skin. In its most severe form, the disease has a major effect on the physical and emotional well-being of the patients. Topical agents are typically used for mild cases of the disease, phototherapy for moderate cases, and systemic agents for severe cases. For moderate to severe cases, systemic biologic drugs, delivered via IV, have dominated the market. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, common side effects of biologics include respiratory infections, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions, while rare side effects include serious nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, seizures, or inflammation of the nerves of the eyes, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer.
 
Current common treatments for psoriasis include topical and systemic drugs, steroids, immunosuppressive drugs such as Cyclosporine A (by Novartis) or methotrexate (“MTX”) and biological drugs such as Enbrel (by Amgen), Amevive (by Biogen, whose patent expired in 2013) and Ustakinumabn (by Janssen Immunology).
 
According to the American Academy of Dermatology, psoriasis affects about 3% of the world’s population and 7.5 million people in the United States. According to Global Data plc, the psoriasis treatment market was worth $8 billion as of 2018 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.26% until 2024. In addition, according to 2014 edition of the Marijuana Business Factbook, U.S. retail sales of medical cannabis are expected to rise significantly over the next five years from an estimated $2.2 billion in 2014 to $8.2 billion in 2018. We believe that cannabis-based formulations have the potential to effectively treat multiple myeloma, psoriasis, PTSD, chronic pain and fibromyalgia.
 
Multiple Myeloma
 
Multiple myeloma is a hematological (blood) cancer that develops in the plasma cells found in bone marrow. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies (immunoglobulins) which are critical for maintaining the body’s immune system. Through a complex, multi-step process, healthy plasma cells transform into malignant myeloma cells. Myeloma cells result in the production of abnormal antibodies, or M proteins. The M proteins offer no benefit to the body, and as the amount of M protein increases, it crowds out normally functioning immunoglobulins. This ultimately causes multiple myeloma symptoms such as bone damage or kidney problems. Multiple myeloma is considered to be incurable but treatable. Remissions may be induced with steroids, chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, and stem cell transplants. Radiation therapy is sometimes used to reduce pain from bone lesions. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States the lifetime risk of getting multiple myeloma is 1 in 143 and it is estimated that 30,330 new cases will be diagnosed in 2016.
Fibromyalgia
 
Fibromyalgia is a chronic health problem that causes pain throughout the body and other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive (memory or thought) problems. According to the National Fibromyalgia Association the disorder affects an estimated ten million people in the United States and an estimated 3 to 6% of the world population. There is no known cure and a variety of prescription medications are often used to reduce pain levels and improve sleep. On June 21, 2007, the FDA approved Lyrica (pregabalin) as the first drug to treat fibromyalgia. Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl) was approved in June 2008 and Savella (milnacipranHCl) was approved in January 2009, both of which are now generic formulations no longer under patent protection.
 
Controlled substance legislation differs between countries (and jurisdictions within those countries) and legislation in certain countries may restrict or limit our ability to distribute or sell our products. We believe that the United States will represent a major market for our Cannabis-Based Medical Products due, in large part, to state level legislation allowing comprehensive public medical cannabis programs. A total of 28 states, the District of Columbia and Guam now allow for comprehensive public medical cannabis programs. Recently approved efforts in 16 states allow use of “low THC, high CBD” products for medical reasons in limited situations.

In Europe, medical cannabis programs regulatory frameworks exist in several countries, such as the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic. It can also be expected that there will be policy changes in the member countries of the European Union concerning the medical use of cannabis and cannabis-based products. We believe that there will be rising demand for cannabis derived medical products and that future growth is expected to be driven by favorable changes in legislation and demographic factors.
 
Low Back Pain
 
Low back pain (LBP) is a significant world-wide complaint that consumes considerable healthcare resources and heavily impacts quality of life for many. In the 2016 report of the health and status of the nation, Health, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 29% of adults suffer from non-fleeting low-back pain. Although prognosis is good for acute back pain in primary care, recurrence is common and 10% of patients develop chronic pain (longer than three months) resulting in higher healthcare and disability compensation costs. Suggested treatment starts with less-invasive, less-expensive therapies, such as OTC NSAIDS followed by stronger long-term oral opioids and when these fail invasive treatments are suggested and finally neuro-destructive procedures. However, NSAIDS provide only a small improvement compared to placebo in chronic LBP and opioids seem to have short term analgesic efficacy, but benefits for function and long term effectiveness are less clear. In light of the high incidence of side effects of opioids and the irreversibility and risk of the invasive solutions, Cannabis represents an additional, relatively safe and cheap, option. Indeed, recent studies have shown that cannabis reduces pain and improves sleep in several medical conditions.
 
The Global Chronic Low Back Pain Market alone is relied upon to achieve an estimation of US$ 9.19 billion by 2025, developing at a rate of 5.1% amid the forecast time frame of 2017-2025.
 
Certain Other Material Agreements
 
Research Agreement with the Chaim Sheba Medical Center
 
On December 29, 2016, we entered into a clinical research agreement (the “Clinical Research Agreement”) with the Fund.
 
Pursuant to the Clinical Research Agreement, the Fund shall perform a Phase I, placebo controlled, maximal dose clinical trial (the “Psoriasis Trial”) to determine the safety, tolerability of topical ointment containing Medical Grade Cannabis (“MGC” or the “Drug Trial”) in healthy volunteers, employing the services of Dr. Aviv Barzilay, Director of the Department of Dermatology at Chaim Sheba Medical Center, to lead the Trial (the “Investigator”). The Trial shall be conducted in compliance with the following, as defined in the Clinical Research Agreement: (1) the Protocol; (2) the Ministry Guidelines; (3) the instructions and terms specified in the Helsinki Committee’s approval; (4) the ICH-GCP; (5) the Helsinki Declarations; (6) the applicable laws, rules and regulations regulating such trials which are applicable in Israel (the “Applicable Laws”); and (7) written instructions and prescriptions issued by us and governing the administration of the Psoriasis Trial.
 
We have undertaken to pay the Fund the amounts specified in the payment schedule set forth in the Research Agreement.
 
On February 1, 2017, following encouraging results that have been achieved at the mid-point of the Psoriasis Trial conducted by us with an Israeli research institute, our Board of Directors and our management and scientific personnel have determined to extend the size and scope of the Psoriasis Trial for the purpose of, among other things, checking the biological markers that have been generated to date with respect to the treatment of psoriasis (proliferation/inhibition and several interleukins).
 
On March 20, 2017, we announced the promising preliminary results from the pre-clinical efficacy testing of our cannabinoid-based topical ointment for treating psoriasis, reporting significant reduction of several inflammation markers specific to psoriasis. We anticipated that the topical ointment will be market-ready during the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and, subject to regulatory approvals from applicable jurisdictions and the Psoriasis Trial completion, the topical ointment should be available for use by those who suffer from psoriasis in the near term. We expected to complete the Phase I Psoriasis Trial for our topical ointment during the next three to six months and start looking for strategic partners in different countries.
 
On April 5, 2017, we announced that as a result of the promising preliminary results from the preclinical efficacy testing of its cannabinoid-based topical ointment for treating psoriasis, reporting significant reduction of several inflammation markers specific to psoriasis, we have received expressions of scientific and medical interest, world-wide, for our cannabinoid-based topical ointment for treating psoriasis. We have expanded the size and scope of our clinical trials and, as previously announced, anticipate that subject to pending regulatory approvals from applicable jurisdictions, the topical ointment should be available for use by those who suffer from psoriasis in the near term.

License Agreement with Emilia Cosmetics Ltd.
 
On August 6, 2015, OWC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Emilia Cosmetics Ltd. (“Emilia”), a large Israeli private label manufacturer which operates in the field of development, production, manufacturing and packaging of health and beauty products including for treatment of human skin disease, for the development, manufacture and marketing of a cannabinoid-based topical ointment to treat psoriasis.
 
On November 27, 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the “Emilia License Agreement”) with Emilia, a leading company in the field of development, production, manufacturing and packaging of health and beauty products for treatment of human skin disease.
 
Prior to entering into the Emilia License Agreement, we and Emilia (the “Parties”) conducted a “Development and Evaluation Program” (as defined in the Emilia License Agreement) for the development of a specific skin care treatment product, which combined Emilia’s formulation with certain medical cannabis extract provided by us for the topical treatment of psoriasis.
 
Pursuant to the Emilia License Agreement, Emilia granted us a limited license with respect to Emilia’s formulation (the “Emilia Intellectual Property”) for the development and commercialization worldwide of a product designed for the topical treatment of psoriasis in humans with our product and upon the successful achievement of the trial, Emilia agreed to grant us an exclusive, worldwide, transferable, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use, sell and commercially exploit the Emilia Intellectual Property (the “Emilia License”) in connection with the Topical Ointment or such other product. In consideration for the Emilia License, from and after the first commercial sales of our product, we shall pay to Emilia a royalty at the rate of ten percent (10%) of net sales of the Topical Ointment or such other product during a ten-year term beginning upon the first commercial sale. In the event the sale of the Topical Ointment or such other product during the royalty term reaches the minimum sales targets as set forth in the Emilia License Agreement, the royalty term will extend for an additional five (5) year term. The trial was completed in May 2016 and as a result we became the exclusive licensee of the Emilia Intellectual Property.
 
Agreements with Medmar LLC
 
On October 11, 2015, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with Medmar LLC (“Medmar”) for the purpose of granting an exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-bearing license, to manufacture, produce, publicize, promote and market certain licensed products described therein in the States of Hawaii and Pennsylvania. Under the memorandum of understanding, Medmar paid us $100,000.
 
On February 8, 2016, we entered into a right of first refusal agreement with Medmar II LLC, an affiliate of Medmar, granting Medmar certain rights in connection with the commercialization of certain of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products in other states in the United States. Under the right of first refusal agreement, Medmar paid us $50,000.
 
On March 17, 2016, we entered into a consulting and license agreement (the “Medmar Consulting and License Agreement”) with Medmar pursuant to which we granted to Medmar an exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-bearing license, to manufacture, produce, publicize, promote and market certain of our products described therein in the State of Maryland. Pursuant to the Medmar Consulting and License Agreement, Medmar was required to pay us royalties at a rate of 20% of net sales until the termination of the agreement. The Medmar Consulting and License Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Medmar Loan Agreement (as defined below).
 
On September 28, 2016, we entered into a non-recourse loan agreement with Medmar (the “Medmar Loan Agreement”) pursuant to which Medmar agreed to loan us a total of $300,000 (the “Loan”), in installments of $50,000, on a non-interest-bearing basis with no conversion rights. The loan, which permitted prepayment at any time, was due 36 months from the date of the loan and the obligation to repay was only triggered after accounting for the set-off of royalties payable to us by Medmar under the Medmar Consulting and License Agreement, if and only to the extent Medmar is required to pay any royalties to us under the Medmar Consulting and License Agreement. To the extent that the royalties payable to us under the Medmar Consulting and License Agreement were insufficient to repay the loan, Medmar had agreed to waive any repayment rights and/or any claim for any such deficiency. Loan installments of $250,000 were made to us prior December 31, 2016 and the last installment of $50,000 was funded in February 2017.

Under the terms of the Medmar Loan Agreement, Medmar received the exclusive right to manufacture, produce, publicize, promote and market certain of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products (as described in the Medmar Consulting and Licensing Agreement) in any state in the United States (the “Medmar Exclusivity Rights”), subject to a new license agreement that was to be negotiated and signed between us and Medmar. Medmar’s rights under the Loan Agreement were to expire on September 28, 2019.
 
On April 21, 2017, we provided written notice to Medmar of our determination to prepay the Loan in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Medmar Loan Agreement, and based upon the full repayment of the non-recourse, non-interest bearing and non-convertible loan, we exercised our absolute right to terminate the Medmar Exclusivity Rights.
 
Agreement with Mediq Innovation Partners
 
On May 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Mediq Innovation Partners (“Mediq”), a German-based company with extensive experience, knowledge and a successful track record of enabling Israel-based companies to penetrate the European markets. We engaged Mediq to consult in the marketing our products and conduct research in Germany. Mediq prepared for us a “road map” to guide us in our penetration into the European Union market.
 
Our Agreement with PharmItBe Ltd.
 
On August 1, 2017 we entered into a service agreement with PharmItBe Ltd (“PharmItBe”) for the development of the second generation of our cannabis soluble tablet delivery system and preparation of the tablet for clinical trials. The development cost amounted to approximately $134,000.
 
On June 13, 2018, we announced that we completed the development of the second generation of our orally-disintegrating tablet. The production of the cannabis soluble tablet for the purpose of clinical trials was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We do not currently have any marketing or sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the pharmaceutical business, which are equipped to market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing capabilities and distribution networks. We intend to out-license some or all our patent rights to more than one party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products, technology and know-how, ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to defend challenges and oppositions from others regarding our proprietary rights and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, including our provisional patents described below. We have not acquired any intellectual property from Dr. Baruch, our Chief Medical and Regulatory Affairs Officer, or Mr. Sinai, our Chief Operating Officer. Rather, they have brought to us their expertise in matters related to medical cannabis, which is based upon their experience in the medical field as well as Dr. Baruch’s prior service leading the Medical Cannabis Unit of the Israeli Ministry of Health.
 
We plan to continue to seek patent protection in the United States and other countries for our proprietary technologies. To date, our intellectual property portfolio comprises 6 patent families and includes 28 filings in selected domains at various stages from Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) filings, National Phase filings and Continuations in Part (“CIP”). Two of the patent families are in the field of multiple myeloma and the other families are in the fields of pharmaceutical emulsions, fibromyalgia, migraine, sexual function and skin disorders. These filings encompass pharmaceutical compositions and devices in these fields.
 

-13-
----


The National Phase is the second of the two main phases of the PCT procedure. It follows the international phase and consists in the processing of the international application before each office of or acting for a contracting state of the PCT that has been designated in the international application. Assuming the successful completion of the clinical trials, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that we will be able to retain the intellectual property rights and secure patent protection for our proprietary developments.
 
While we retain full ownership on our intellectual property rights that we conceived the Psoriasis Research Agreement with Sheba provides that all intellectual property that is conceived during the course of the research is to be jointly owned by Sheba and us.
 
On November 8, 2017, we were granted a Certificate of Patent, #2015101908 (the “Innovation Patent”) from the Commissioner of Patents, Commonwealth of Australia, for our Topical Ointment for the treatment of skin disorders. Pre-clinical results of our Topical Ointment strongly indicate that it may lower various inflammatory markers by up to 70% and inhibit Keratocytes proliferation, a manifestation of various skin disorders, especially psoriasis. A human safety study for our Topical Ointment is currently ongoing. We believe that the Innovation Patent granted in Australia, valid for a term of 8 years, should be followed by additional patent grants in other jurisdictions and should afford us protection and competitive advantage, subsequent to efficacy trials to be performed in 2018, to manufacture, distribute and sell our Cannabis-Based Medical Products wherever there exists a lawful market for medical cannabis products and treatments.
 
We anticipate that we will file additional patent applications in conjunction with our research, testing, and development of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products.
 
Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, invention or improvement, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities.
 
To date, our intellectual property portfolio comprises 6 patent families and includes 28filings in selected domains at various stages from the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) filings, National Phase filings and Continuations in Part (CIP). Two of the patent families are in the field of Multiple Myeloma and the other families are in the fields of pharmaceutical emulsions, fibromyalgia, migraine and skin disorders. These filings encompass pharmaceutical compositions and devices in these fields.
 
The national phase is the second of the two main phases of the PCT procedure. It follows the international phase and consists in the processing of the international application before each office of or acting for a contracting state of the PCT that has been designated in the international application. Assuming the successful completion of the clinical trials, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that we will be able to retain the intellectual property rights and secure patent protection for our proprietary developments.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from larger companies that are, or may be, in the process of offering similar products to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have or may be expected to have.
 
Competitors may include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and public and private research institutions. Our management cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously harm our business prospects. These competitors may be able to react to market changes, respond more rapidly to new regulations or allocate greater resources to the development and promotion of their products than we can.
 
Furthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish collaborative relationships among themselves to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share. Large pharmaceutical companies may eventually enter the market.
 
Given the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies in general and cannabis-related medical research and development in particular, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Time-to-market is an important factor in our industry and our success will depend on our ability to develop innovative products that will be accepted by patients as efficient and helpful to use.
 

-14-
----


Our success will also depend on our ability to respond quickly to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and our operational performance.
 
There can be given no assurance that any of our Cannabis-Based Medical Products will obtain regulatory approval in the United States or in other markets that we currently intend to market such products
 
Government Laws and Regulations Relating to the Cannabis Industry
 
Israel
 
To date, our research and development activities have been conducted in and limited to Israel. The cannabis-based products we are developing contain controlled substance (cannabis) as defined in the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance New Version, 5733 - 1973. In Israel, licenses to cultivate, possess and to use cannabis for medical research are granted by the Ministry of Health, IMCA - Israel Medical Cannabis Agency, on an ad-hoc basis. We obtained necessary IMCA licenses in order to carry out the research in collaboration with Sheba Academic Medical Center, Sourasky Medical Center, PharmItB, Emilia, Dead Sea and Arava Science Center and the Technion Israel Institute of Technology (Technion). We are acquiring the cannabis needed for our research activities from G.K. Medical Cannabis, Canndoc or IMC, all government-licensed Israeli medical cannabis growers. Currently we have licenses in order to continue our activities in collaboration with Sheba Academic Medical Center, Sourasky Medical Center, PharmItBe, Pharmaceed and the Technion. We received additional license for a phase I clinical trial that we intend to start in the coming months in Sourasky hospital for the safety of our cannabis soluble tablet delivery system. We have applied for additional license for a phase II trial we are starting in the third fiscal quarter in Kaplan hospital for the efficacy of our psoriasis ointment.
 
Although we have been successful in obtaining a license to use cannabis for medical research, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain this license in the future.
 
United States
 
In the event that we seek to conduct any product-related activities in the United States in the future, the research and development, manufacturing, distribution and sale of our product prospects will become subject to the United States’ Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the “CSA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the CSA, Cannabis sativa, or botanical marijuana, is a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning that it has no medical use and is subject to the highest level of Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) restrictions and enforcement. However, the FDA has the authority to review drugs derived from botanical marijuana to determine whether they are safe and effective for a legitimate medical use. If the FDA approves a drug derived from a substance appearing on the controlled substance schedules, the FDA may provide scientific guidance as to the schedule on which the ultimate drug product should be placed. The CSA requires FDA to consider the following eight factors when making a scheduling recommendation (21 U.S.C. § 811(c)):

1. | Actual or relative potential for abuse 
---+----------------------------------------------------------
2. | Scientific evidence of pharmacological effect 
3. | Current scientific knowledge regarding the substance 
4. | History and current pattern of abuse 
5. | Scope, duration, and significance of abuse 
6. | Risk to public health 
7. | Psychic or physiological dependence liability 
8. | Immediate precursor of a substance already controlled 

 
In general, FDA approval of a new drug application, or NDA, for a substance is considered adequate evidence of an “accepted medical use” under the CSA. However, United States case law dictates that substances without an FDA-approved new drug application, or NDA, must meet the following criteria to have a “currently accepted medical use” making such substances eligible for listing on Schedules II-V (57 Fed. Reg. 10,499, 10,504-06 (Mar. 26, 1992):
 

1. | The drug product’s chemistry is known and reproducible 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------


-15-
----


2. | There are adequate studies demonstrating the drug’s safety 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | There are adequate and well-controlled studies proving the drug’s efficacy 
4. | The drug is accepted by qualified experts 
5. | Relevant scientific evidence on the drug is widely available 

 
The FDA has not approved marijuana for any medical indication and has not yet approved any drug product derived or isolated from botanical marijuana. However, the FDA has previously approved two drug products containing a chemically synthesized version of a substance present in the marijuana plant and one drug product containing a synthetic substance that is not found in the marijuana plant but that has chemical activity similar to compounds derived from marijuana.
 
In April 2018, a FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex, made by GW Pharmaceuticals, an epilepsy medication made with an ingredient found in marijuana.
 
If approved by the FDA, we anticipate that our products will be listed by the DEA as a Schedule II or III controlled substance. Consequently, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use of our future products will very likely be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA.
 
In addition to federal scheduling and control, individual states have enacted controlled substance laws and regulations. Although state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule certain products. In the case of marijuana, while United States federal law totally prohibits the use, distribution, growing, and possession of marijuana, individual states have enacted laws permitting the use and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes. To date, a total of 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have laws allowing medical use of marijuana and 20 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico have enacted comprehensive public medical cannabis programs, meaning that they (1) provide protection from criminal penalties related to medical use of marijuana, (2) provide access to marijuana via home cultivation, dispensaries, or other system, (3) allow a variety of marijuana strains, and (4) permits smoking or vaporization of the marijuana plant or an extract therefrom. In addition, 17 states allow use of “low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)” products for medical reasons in limited situations. Each state that has established a medical marijuana program (with the exception of California) has also enacted laws restricting participation to patients with specific medical conditions who have received an explicit recommendation or referral for treatment of the condition with medical marijuana from one or more physicians. Common restrictions include patients with cancer, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, or any chronic disease causing cachexia, severe pain, severe nausea, seizures, or persistent muscle spasms (including treatment for such diseases which may cause any of these conditions). In addition, while state laws authorize qualified individuals to smoke or vaporize marijuana for medical purposes, it is not clear that other uses of marijuana or its extracts or derivatives (e.g., topical or edible) are permitted for medical use.
 
As of the date of this filing, we have provided consulting services to a medical marijuana program with locations in Hawaii and Pennsylvania. We do not grow or distribute cannabis. However, our providing of ancillary products and services to state-approved programs could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law. Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws.
 
Enforcement of United States Federal Laws
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of marijuana for medical purposes, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. As discussed above, the CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, 31 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have legalized certain cannabis-related activity. However, with respect to our products, compliance with state laws provides little protection from prosecution under federal laws at the discretion of the various United States Attorney offices, which are part of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
 
From 2009 to 2014, the DOJ issued a series of official memoranda setting the agency’s enforcement policies relative to state programs legalizing medical use of marijuana. The most prominent of these documents was issued by Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the Cole Memo), which reiterated DOJ’s authority to prosecute violations of federal laws relating to marijuana and outlined specific marijuana enforcement priorities, such as preventing distribution to minors and preventing revenues from marijuana sales from reaching criminal organizations. The Cole Memo also outlined a general policy that DOJ would defer on ordinary enforcement matters if a state had established regulatory and enforcement systems addressing potential risks and other law enforcement interests related to marijuana.
 

-16-
----


However, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ rescinded all marijuana enforcement memoranda issued by the agency between 2009 and 2014, including the Cole Memo. The January 4 memorandum states that the CSA prohibits cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana and that such activities can also lead to prosecution under the money laundering statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956-57), the unlicensed money transmitter statute (18 U.S.C. § 1960), and the Bank Secrecy Act or BSA (31 U.S.C. § 5318). In addition, the memorandum directs all United States Attorneys to enforce federal law and to “weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community” (Office of the Attorney General, Memorandum for All United States Attorneys RE: Marijuana Enforcement (Jan. 4, 2018)).
 
The January 4 memorandum demonstrates that DOJ’s current enforcement policy puts all companies with operations relating to the cultivation, distribution, and sale of marijuana and products derived from marijuana at risk of prosecution, even if such companies comply with state laws allowing these activities. However, it is still unclear whether United States Attorneys will aggressively pursue companies operating in states that have legalized certain distribution and sale of marijuana, or how the DOJ’s policy will affect any drug derived from botanical marijuana that is approved by FDA.
 
FinCEN
 
Since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we or our consulting clients may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts in the United States. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the BSA. In general, a financial institutions decision to open, close, or refuse any account or relationship should be based on multiple factors specific to that institution. These factors may include business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering particular products or services, and capacity to manage those risks effectively. The FinCEN guidance describes thorough due diligence as a critical aspect of this assessment for customers with marijuana-related business.
 
FinCEN advises financial institutions to conduct customer due diligence for cannabis-related businesses that includes: (1) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (2) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (3) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (4) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (5) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (6) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in the FinCEN guidance; and (7) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained about such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 
Europe
 
Approximately 250 substances, including cannabis, are listed in the Schedules annexed to the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (New York, 1961, amended 1972), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 1971) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (introducing control on precursors) (Vienna, 1988). The purpose of these listings is to control and limit the use of these drugs according to a classification of their therapeutic value, risk of abuse and health dangers, and to minimize the diversion of precursor chemicals to illegal drug manufacturers. The 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended in 1972 classifies cannabis as Schedule I (“substances with addictive properties, presenting a serious risk of abuse”) and as Schedule IV (“the most dangerous substances, already listed in Schedule I, which are particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value”) narcotic drug. The 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances classifies THC - the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of cannabis - as schedule I psychotropic substance (Substances presenting a high risk of abuse, posing a particularly, serious threat to public health which are of very little or no therapeutic value).

-17-
----


Most countries in Europe are parties to these conventions, which govern international trade and domestic control of these substances, including cannabis. They may interpret and implement their obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining manufacturing and/or marketing approval for our products in those countries or to providing consulting services in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be manufactured and/or marketed, or for us to provide consulting services, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period. While some countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Romania, and Finland have decriminalized cannabis or permit its use for medical purposes, no country has completely legalized it.
 
Regulations Related to the Drug Regulatory Process
 
We operate in a highly controlled regulatory environment. Stringent regulations establish requirements relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of pharmaceuticals. Regulations also cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. Further, many countries have stringent regulations relating to the possession and use of cannabis.
 
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our future product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical products have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. We expect to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, preclinical studies and clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other product candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, as a result of these failures, we may also be unable to obtain additional financing.
 
Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new pharmaceutical product be approved or exempted from approval before it is marketed, and have established high standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some products are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
A summary of the Israeli, U.S. and EU regulatory processes follow below:
 
Israel
 
In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations also require authorization from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and similar trials, an additional authorization of the overseeing institutional ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since, at this time, we intend to perform all of the clinical studies in Israel, we will be required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health.

-18-
----


Israel’s Ministry of Health, which regulates medical testing, has adopted protocols that correspond, generally, to those of the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), making it comparatively straightforward for studies conducted in Israel to satisfy FDA and the EMA requirements, thereby enabling medical technologies subjected to clinical trials in Israel to reach U.S. and EU commercial markets in an expedited fashion. Many members of Israel’s medical community have earned international prestige in their chosen fields of expertise and routinely collaborate, teach and lecture at leading medical centers throughout the world. Israel also has free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.
 
Currently we do not conduct any product-related activities such as research, development, manufacturing or marketing activities outside of Israel, nor do we expect to for the foreseeable future.
 
United States
 
In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the safety and effectiveness standards for our products and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of product candidates on a product-by-product basis.
 
Preclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, testing, a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to begin human testing. Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical testing program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent. In Phase 1, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of product candidates. In Phase 3, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. The time and expense that will be required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing within any specific period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the Institutional Review Board responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk.
 
If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases 1, 2 and 3) are deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the candidate product for its intended use, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA, a New Drug Application, or NDA, seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We have not completed our clinical trials for any candidate product for any intended use and therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filings.
 
The purpose of the NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether it ought to approve the candidate product for marketing for specific intended uses. The fact that the FDA has designated a drug as an orphan drug for a particular intended use does not mean that the drug has been approved for marketing. Marketing and commercialization of a drug is permitted only after FDA approves an NDA for the drug. A request for orphan drug status must be filed before the NDA is filed. The orphan drug designation, though, provides certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity subject to certain exceptions.
 
The NDA normally contains, among other things, sections describing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, microbiology, the results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate product.
 
We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 

-19-
----


Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials (i.e., Phase 4 trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product candidate, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product candidate with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 
Although we currently have no approvals to market our products from the FDA, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product prospects, we will be required to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, including any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as a condition of approval. We will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. We, as well as certain of our partners or subcontractors, will be required to register our facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and will be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing, or cGMP, regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon drug manufacturers. Accordingly, we must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 
Our products may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that we will be required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, we must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and standards or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license 
● | approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
We may also be subject to various federal, state and international laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-kickback law, which governs federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), makes it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Many states have similar laws that are not restricted to federal healthcare programs. Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursement, including claims for the sale of drugs or services, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. If the government or a whistleblower were to allege that we violated these laws there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A finding of liability under these laws can have significant adverse financial implications for us and can result in payment of large penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given their broad reach and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we cannot assure you that some of our activities will not be challenged or deemed to violate some of these laws.
 
European Economic Area
 
Although we are not currently seeking regulatory approval in the EU, we or our potential future licensees may do so in the future. As such, a summary of the EU regulatory processes follows below.
 
A medicinal product may only be placed on the market in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), composed of the 27 EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, when a marketing authorization has been issued by the competent authority of a member state pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC (as recently amended by Directive 2004/27/EC), or an authorization has been granted under the centralized procedure in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 or its predecessor, Regulation 2309/93. There are essentially three community procedures created under prevailing European pharmaceutical legislation that, if successfully completed, allow an applicant to place a medicinal product on the market in the EEA.
 
Centralized Procedure
 
Regulation 726/2004/EC now governs the centralized procedure when a marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, acting in its capacity as the European Licensing Authority on the advice of the EMA. That authorization is valid throughout the entire community and directly or (as to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) indirectly allows the applicant to place the product on the market in all member states of the EEA. The EMA is the administrative body responsible for coordinating the existing scientific resources available in the member states for evaluation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. Certain medicinal products, as described in the Annex to Regulation 726/2004, must be authorized centrally. These are products that are developed by means of a biotechnological process in accordance with Paragraph 1 to the Annex to the Regulation. Medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes must also be authorized centrally. Starting on May 20, 2008, the mandatory centralized procedure was extended to autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. Finally, all medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 must be authorized under the centralized procedure. An applicant may also opt for assessment through the centralized procedure if it can show that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization centrally is in the interests of patients at the community level. For each application submitted to the EMA for scientific assessment, the EMA is required to ensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), is given within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. This 210 days period does not include the time that the applicant to answer any questions raised during the application procedure, the so-called ‘clock stop’ period. If the opinion is positive, the EMA is required to send the opinion to the European Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft decision granting a marketing authorization. This draft decision may differ from the CHMP opinion, stating reasons for diverging for the CHMP opinion. The draft decision is sent to the applicant and the member states, after which the European Commission takes a final decision. If the initial opinion of the CHMP is negative, the applicant is afforded an opportunity to seek a re-examination of the opinion. The CHMP is required to re-examine its opinion within 60 days following receipt of the request by the applicant. All CHMP refusals and the reasons for refusal are made public on the EMA website. Without a centralized marketing authorization it is prohibited to place a medicinal product that must be authorized centrally on the market in the EU.

Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures
 
With the exception of products that are authorized centrally, the competent authorities of the member states are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for medicinal products placed on their national markets. If the applicant for a marketing authorization intends to market the same medicinal product in more than one member state, the applicant may seek an authorization progressively in the community under the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure. Mutual recognition is used if the medicinal product has already been authorized in a member state. In this case, the holder of this marketing authorization requests the member state where the authorization has been granted to act as reference member state by preparing an updated assessment report that is then used to facilitate mutual recognition of the existing authorization in the other member states in which approval is sought (the so-called concerned member state(s)). The reference member state must prepare an updated assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. This report together with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) (which sets out the conditions of use of the product), and a labeling and package leaflet are sent to the concerned member states for their consideration. The concerned member states are required to approve the assessment report, the SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet within 90 days of receipt of these documents. The total procedural time is 180 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is used in cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorization in the EU at the time of application. The applicant requests a member state of its choice to act as reference member state to prepare an assessment report that is then used to facilitate agreement with the concerned member states and the grant of a national marketing authorization in all of these member states. In this procedure, the reference member state must prepare, for consideration by the concerned member states, the draft assessment report, a draft SmPC and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. As in the case of mutual recognition, the concerned member states are required to approve these documents within 90 days of their receipt.
 
For both mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, if a concerned member state objects to the grant of a marketing authorization on the grounds of a potential serious risk to public health, it may raise a reasoned objection with the reference member state. The points of disagreement are in the first instance referred to the Co-ordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures, to reach an agreement within 60 days of the communication of the points of disagreement. If member states fail to reach an agreement, then the matter is referred to the EMA and CHMP for arbitration. The CHMP is required to deliver a reasoned opinion within 60 days of the date on which the matter is referred. The scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP forms the basis for a binding European Commission decision.
 
Irrespective of whether the medicinal product is assessed centrally, de-centrally or through a process of mutual recognition, the medicinal product must be manufactured in accordance with the principles of good manufacturing practice as set out in Directive 2003/94/EC and Volume 4 of the rules governing medicinal products in the European community. Moreover, community law requires the clinical results in support of clinical safety and efficacy based upon clinical trials conducted in the European community to be in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC, which implements good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. Clinical trials conducted outside the European community and used to support applications for marketing within the EU must have been conducted in a way consistent with the principles set out in Directive 2001/20/EC. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU requires, pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC, authorization by the relevant national competent authority where a trial takes place, and an ethics committee to have issued a favorable opinion in relation to the arrangements for the trial. It also requires that the sponsor of the trial, or a person authorized to act on his behalf in relation to the trial, be established in the community.

National Procedure
 
This procedure is available for medicinal products that do not fall within the scope of mandatory centralized authorization and are intended for use in only one EU member state. Specific procedures and timelines differ between member states, but the duration of the procedure is generally 210 days and based on a risk/efficacy assessment by the competent authority of the member state concerned, followed by determination of SmPC, package leaflet and label text/layout and subsequently grant of the marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations granted on this basis are not mutually recognized by other member states.
 
There are various types of applications for marketing authorizations:
 
Full Applications. A full application is one that is made under any of the community procedures described above and “stands alone” in the sense that it contains all of the particulars and information required by Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83 (as amended) to allow the competent authority to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the product and in particular the balance between benefit and risk. Article 8(3)(l) in particular refers to the need to present the results of the applicant’s research on (i) pharmaceutical (physical-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, (ii) preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) studies and (iii) clinical trials in humans. The nature of these tests, studies and trials is explained in more detail in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. Full applications would be required for products containing new active substances not previously approved by the competent authority, but may also be made for other products.
 
Abridged Applications. Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC contains exemptions from the requirement that the applicant provide the results of its own preclinical and clinical research. There are three regulatory routes for an applicant to seek an exemption from providing such results, namely (i) cross-referral to an innovator’s results without consent of the innovator, (ii) well established use according to published literature and (iii) consent to refer to an existing dossier of research results filed by a previous applicant.
 
Cross-referral to Innovator’s Data
 
Articles 10(1) and 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC provide the legal basis for an applicant to seek a marketing authorization on the basis that its product is a generic medicinal product (a copy) of a reference medicinal product that has already been authorized, in accordance with community provisions. A reference product is, in principle, an original product granted an authorization on the basis of a full dossier of particulars and information. This is the main exemption used by generic manufacturers for obtaining a marketing authorization for a copy product. The generic applicant is not required to provide the results of preclinical studies and of clinical trials if its product meets the definition of a generic medicinal product and the applicable regulatory results protection period for the results submitted by the innovator has expired. A generic medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product:

● | having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance as the reference medicinal product; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | having the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product; and 
● | whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. 

 
Applications in respect of a generic medicinal product cannot be made before the expiry of the protection period. Where the reference product was granted a national marketing authorization pursuant to an application made before October 30, 2005, the protection period is either 6 years or 10 years, depending upon the election of the particular member state concerned. Where the reference product was granted a marketing authorization centrally, pursuant to an application made before November 20, 2005, the protection period is 10 years. For applications made after these dates, Regulation 726/2004 and amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC provide for a harmonized protection period regardless of the approval route utilized. The harmonized protection period is in total 10 years, including eight years of research data protection and two years of marketing protection. The effect is that the originator’s results can be the subject of a cross-referral application after eight years, but any resulting authorization cannot be exploited for a further two years. The rationale of this procedure is not that the competent authority does not have before it relevant tests and trials upon which to assess the efficacy and safety of the generic product, but that the relevant particulars can, if the research data protection period has expired, be found on the originator’s file and used for assessment of the generic medicinal product. The 10-year protection period can be extended to 11 years where, in the first eight years, post-authorization, the holder of the authorization obtains approval for a new indication assessed as offering a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing products.

If the copy product does not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product or if certain types of changes occur in the active substance(s) or in the therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration in relation to the reference medicinal product, Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC provides that the results of the appropriate preclinical studies or clinical trials must be provided by the applicant.
 
Well-Established Medicinal Use
 
Under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a product have a well-established medicinal use within the community with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate that the constituent or constituents of the product have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However, use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance as a medicinal product in the EU. Even after 10 years’ systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider among other factors the period over which a substance has been used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason, different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years. If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use compared with that to which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results would have to be provided.
Informed Consent
 
Under Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the grant of a marketing authorization the holder of such authorization may consent to a competent authority utilizing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation that it submitted to obtain approval for a medicinal product to assess a subsequent application relating to a medicinal product possessing the same qualitative and quantitative composition with respect to the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form.
Law Relating to Pediatric Research
 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 (as amended by Regulation (EC) 1902/2006) was adopted on December 12, 2006. This Regulation governs the development of medicinal products for human use in order to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the pediatric population. It requires any application for marketing authorization made after July 26, 2008 in respect of a product not authorized in the European Community on January 26, 2007 (the time the Regulation entered into force), to include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, unless the product is subject to an agreed waiver or deferral or unless the product is excluded from the scope of Regulation 1902/2006 (generics, hybrid medicinal products, biosimilars, homeopathic and traditional (herbal) medicinal products and medicinal products containing one or more active substances of well-established medicinal use). Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances where pediatric studies are not required or desirable. Deferrals can be granted in certain circumstances where the initiation or completion of pediatric studies should be deferred until appropriate studies in adults have been performed. Moreover, this regulation imposes the same obligation from January 26, 2009 on an applicant seeking approval of a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a product already authorized and still protected by a supplementary protection certificate granted under Regulation EC 469/2009 and its precursor (EEC) 1768/92 or by a patent that qualifies for the granting of such a supplementary protection certificate. The pediatric Regulation 1901/2006 also provides, subject to certain conditions, a reward for performing such pediatric studies, regardless of whether the pediatric results provided resulted in the grant of a pediatric indication. This reward comes in the form of an extension of six months to the supplementary protection certificate granted in respect of the product, unless the product is subject to orphan drug designation, in which case the 10-year market exclusivity period for such orphan products is extended to 12 years. If any of the non-centralized procedures for marketing authorization have been used, the six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is only granted if the medicinal product is authorized in all member states.

Post-authorization Obligations
 
In the pre-authorization phase the applicant must provide a detailed pharmacovigilance plan that it intends to implement post-authorization. An authorization to market a medicinal product in the EU carries with it an obligation to comply with many post-authorization organizational and behavioral regulations relating to the marketing and other activities of authorization holders. These include requirements relating to post-authorization efficacy studies, post-authorization safety studies, adverse event reporting and other pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising, packaging and labeling, patient package leaflets, distribution and wholesale dealing. The regulations frequently operate within a criminal law framework and failure to comply with the requirements may not only affect the authorization, but also can lead to financial and other sanctions levied on the company in question and responsible officers. As a result of the currently on-going overhaul of EU pharmacovigilance legislation the financial and organizational burden on market authorization holders will increase significantly, such as the obligation to maintain a pharmacovigilance system master file that applies to all holders of marketing authorizations granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Marketing authorization holders must furthermore collect data on adverse events associated with use of the authorized product outside the scope of the authorization. Pharmacovigilance for biological products and medicines with a new active substance will be strengthened by subjecting their authorization to additional monitoring activities. The EU is currently in the process of issuing implementing regulations for the new pharmacovigilance framework.
 
Any authorization granted by member state authorities, which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorized product in the authorizing member state ceases to be valid. When an authorized product previously placed on the market in the authorizing member state is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorization for that product shall cease to be valid. The same two three year periods apply to authorizations granted by the European Commission based on the centralized procedure.
 
Employees
 
We presently have 3 full-time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer is employed under a service agreement with us. Our officers are expected to dedicate approximately 60% of their professional time to our business until such time that we receive regulatory approval of any Cannabis-Based Medical Products. Our subsidiary currently has six employees and conducts our medical research through collaboration agreements with third parties.
