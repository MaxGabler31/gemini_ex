 Item 1. Business
 Background
 Preformed Line Products Company together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead, ground-mounted and underground networks for the energy, telecommunication, cable operators, information (data communication) and other similar industries. The Company’s primary products support, protect, connect, terminate and secure cables and wires. The Company also provides solar hardware systems and mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications. The Company’s goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the research, innovation, development, manufacture and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy, communications and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets.
 The Company serves a worldwide market through strategically located domestic and international manufacturing facilities. Each of the Company’s domestic and international manufacturing facilities have obtained an International Organization of Standardization (“ISO”) 9001:2015 Certified Management System Certificate. The ISO 9001:2015 certified management system is a globally recognized certified quality standard for manufacturing and assists the Company in marketing its products throughout the world. The Company’s customers include public and private energy utilities and communication companies, cable operators, financial institutions, governmental agencies, contractors and subcontractors, distributors and value-added resellers. The Company is not dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues.
The Company’s products include:
 •Energy Products
 •Communications Products
 •Special Industries Products
 Energy Products are used to support, protect, terminate and secure both power conductor and fiber communication cables and to control cable dynamics (e.g., vibration). Formed wire products are based on the principle of forming a variety of stiff wire materials into a helical (spiral) shape. Advantages of using the Company’s helical formed wire products are that they are economical, dependable and easy to use. The Company introduced formed wire products to the power industry over 70 years ago and such products enjoy an almost universal acceptance in the Company’s markets. Related products include hardware for supporting and protecting transmission conductors, spacers, spacer-dampers, stockbridge dampers, corona suppression devices and various compression fittings for dead-end applications. Energy products were approximately 61%, 66% and 67% of the Company’s revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Communications Products, including protective closures, are used to protect fixed line communication networks, such as fiber optic cable or copper cable, from moisture, environmental hazards and other potential contaminants. The protective closures also support Fiber-to-the-Premises ("FTTP") applications by carrying fiber optic technology into homes and businesses. In addition to closures, the Company supplies the communication industry with formed wire products to hold, support, protect and terminate the copper wires and cables and the fiber optic cables used by that industry to transfer voice, video or data signals. Communications products were approximately 30%, 24% and 22% of the Company’s revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Special Industries Products include hardware assemblies, pole line hardware, resale products, underground connectors, solar hardware systems, guy markers, tree guards, fiber optic cable markers, pedestal markers and urethane products. They are used by energy, renewable energy, communications, cable and special industries (i.e., metal building, tower and antenna industries, the agriculture and arborist industries, and marine systems industry) for various applications and are defined as products that complement the Company’s core line offerings. Special industries products were approximately 9%, 10% and 11% of the Company’s revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
International Operations
 The international operations of the Company are essentially the same as its domestic ("PLP-USA") business. The Company manufactures similar types of products in its international plants as are sold domestically, sells to similar types of customers and faces similar types of competition (and in some cases, the same competitors). Sources of supply of raw materials are not significantly different internationally. See Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information and financial data relating to the Company’s international operations that represent reportable segments.
Sales and Marketing
 Domestically and internationally, the Company markets its products through a direct sales force and manufacturing representatives. The direct sales force is employed by the Company and works with manufacturers’ representatives, as well as key direct accounts and distributors who also buy and resell the Company’s products. The manufacturer’s representatives are independent organizations that represent the Company as well as other complimentary product lines. These organizations are paid a commission based on the sales amount they generate.
Research and Development
 The Company is committed to providing technical leadership through scientific research and product development in order to continue to expand the Company’s position as a supplier to the communications and power industries. Research is conducted on a continuous basis using internal experience in conjunction with outside professional expertise to develop state-of-the-art materials for several of the Company’s products. These products capitalize on cost-efficiency while offering exacting mechanical performance that meets or exceeds industry standards. The Company’s research and development activities have resulted in numerous patents being issued to the Company (see “Patents and Trademarks” below).
 Early in its history, the Company recognized the need to understand the performance of its products and the needs of its customers. To that end, the Company developed a 38,000 square foot Research and Engineering Center located at its corporate headquarters in Mayfield Village, Ohio. Using the Research and Engineering Center, engineers and technicians simulate a wide range of external conditions encountered by the Company’s products to ensure quality, durability and performance. The work performed in the Research and Engineering Center includes advanced studies and experimentation with various forms of vibration and environmental changes.
The Research and Engineering Center is one of the most sophisticated in the world in its specialized field. The Research and Engineering Center also has an advanced prototyping technology machine on-site to develop models of new designs where intricate part details are studied prior to the construction of expensive production tooling. Today, the Company’s reputation for vibration testing, tensile testing, fiber optic cable testing, environmental testing, field vibration monitoring and third-party contract testing is a competitive advantage. In addition to testing, the work performed at the Company’s Research and Development Center continues to fuel product development efforts. For example, the Company estimates that approximately 17.9% of 2021 revenues were attributed to products developed by the Company in the past five years. In addition, the Company’s position in the industry is further reinforced by its long-standing leadership role in many key international technical organizations which are charged with the responsibility of establishing industry-wide specifications and performance criteria, including IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), CIGRE (Counsiel Internationale des Grands Reseaux Electriques a Haute Tension), and IEC (International Electromechanical Commission). Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs for new products were $3.3 million in 2021, $2.8 million in 2020 and $3.0 million in 2019.
 Patents and Trademarks
The Company applies for patents in the U.S. and other countries, as appropriate, to protect its significant patentable developments. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had in force 49 U.S. patents and 131 international patents in 21 countries and had 37 pending U.S. patent applications and 47 pending international applications. While such domestic and international patents expire from time to time, the Company continues to apply for and obtain patent protection on a regular basis. Patents held by the Company in the aggregate are of material importance in the operation of the Company’s business. The Company, however, does not believe that any single patent, or group of related patents, is essential to the Company’s business as a whole or to any of its businesses. Additionally, the Company owns and uses a substantial body of proprietary information and numerous trademarks. The Company relies on nondisclosure agreements to protect trade secrets and other proprietary data and technology. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had obtained U.S. registration on 32 trademarks and 4 trademark application remained pending. International registrations amounted to 240 registrations in 35 countries, with 25 pending international registrations.
 U.S. patents are issued for terms of 20 years beginning with the date of filing of the patent application. Patents issued by international countries generally expire 20 years after filing. U.S. and international patents are not renewable after expiration of their initial term. U.S. and international trademarks are generally perpetual, renewable in 10-year increments upon a showing of continued use. To the knowledge of management, the Company is not subject to any significant allegation or charges of infringement of intellectual property rights by any organization.
 In the normal course of business, the Company occasionally makes and receives inquiries with regard to possible patent and trademark infringement. The extent of such inquiries from third parties has been limited generally to verbal remarks or letters to Company representatives. The Company believes that it is unlikely that the outcome of these inquiries will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.


Competition
 All of the markets that the Company serves are highly competitive. In each market, the principal methods of competition are price, performance, and service. The Company believes, however, that several factors (described below) provide the Company with a competitive advantage.
 •The Company has a strong and stable workforce. This consistent and continuous knowledge base has afforded the Company the ability to provide superior service to the Company’s customers and representatives.
 •The Company’s Research and Engineering Center in Mayfield Village, Ohio and the engineering departments at the Company’s subsidiary operations around the world maintain a strong technical support function to develop unique solutions to customer problems.
 •The Company is vertically integrated both in manufacturing and distribution and is continually upgrading equipment and processes.
 •The Company is sensitive to the marketplace and provides an extra measure of service in cases of emergency, storm damage and other supply delivery situations. This high level of customer service and customer responsiveness is a hallmark of the Company.
 •The Company’s 30 sales and manufacturing locations ensure close support and proximity to customers worldwide.
 Domestically, there are several competitors for formed wire products. Although it has other competitors in many of the countries where it has plants, the Company has leveraged its expertise and is very strong in the global market. The Company believes that it is the world’s largest manufacturer of formed wire products for energy and communications markets. However, the Company’s formed wire products compete against other pole line hardware products manufactured by other companies.
 The fiber optic closure market is one of the most competitive product areas for the Company, with the Company competing against, among others, CommScope and Corning. There are a number of primary competitors and several smaller niche competitors that compete at all levels in the marketplace. The Company believes that it is one of four leading suppliers of fiber optic closures.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by the Company are galvanized wire, stainless steel, aluminum covered steel wire, aluminum rod, plastic resins, glass-filled plastic compounds, neoprene rubbers and aluminum castings. The Company also uses certain other materials such as fasteners, packaging materials and fiber communications devices. The Company believes that it has adequate sources of supply for the raw materials used in its manufacturing processes and it regularly attempts to develop and maintain sources of supply in order to extend availability and encourage competitive pricing of these products.
 Most plastic resins are purchased under contracts to stabilize costs and improve delivery performance and are available from a number of reliable suppliers. Wire and aluminum rods are purchased in standard stock diameters and coils under contracts from a number of reliable suppliers. Contracts have firm prices except for fluctuations of base metals and petroleum prices, which result in surcharges when global demand is greater than the available supply.
 The Company also relies on certain other manufacturers to supply products that complement the Company’s product lines, such as ferrous castings, fiber optic cable and connectors and various metal racks. The Company believes there are multiple sources of supply for these products.
 The Company relies on sole source manufacturers for certain raw materials used in production. The current state of economic uncertainty presents a risk that existing suppliers could go out of business or be unable to meet customer demand. However, there are other potential sources available for these materials, and the Company believes that it could relocate the tooling and processes to other manufacturers if necessary.
 Raw material costs increased throughout 2021, partially as a result of supply chain constraints. The Company expects prices on metals and plastics to continue to increase throughout 2022. Throughout 2021, the Company experienced significant raw material and transportation cost inflation that negatively affected its earnings. To offset these increased costs, the Company implemented several price increases in the U.S. and internationally in 2021. Due to the large volume in the Company's backlog, tailwinds from these increases are expected in 2022, however, continued cost inflation in these areas may require further price adjustments in future periods to maintain profit margin. Any price increases could have a negative effect on demand.


Backlog Orders
 The Company’s order backlog is incredibly strong and was approximately $242.9 million at the end of 2021 and $115.1 million at the end of 2020. All customer orders entered are firm at the time of entry. Substantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2021 is expected to be shipped to customers in 2022.
Seasonality
 The Company markets products that are used by utility maintenance and construction crews worldwide. The products are marketed through distributors and directly to end users, who maintain stock to ensure adequate supply for their customers or construction crews. As a result, the Company does not have a wide variation in sales from quarter to quarter.
 Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
The Company is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws, including laws and regulations that (i) relate to air and water quality, (ii) impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, (iii) establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous waste, and (iv) require proper storage, handling, packaging, labeling, and transporting of products and components classified as hazardous materials. Stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with these environmental laws. In addition, environmental laws could impose liability for costs associated with investigating and remediating contamination at the Company’s facilities or at third-party facilities at which the Company has arranged for the disposal treatment of hazardous materials.
 The Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects, with all applicable environmental laws and the Company is not aware of any noncompliance or obligation to investigate or remediate contamination that could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability. The Company does not expect to make any material capital expenditures during 2022 for environmental control facilities. The environmental laws continue to be amended and revised to impose stricter obligations, and compliance with future additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays. However, the Company does not believe that these expenditures will ultimately result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company cannot predict the precise effect such future requirements, if enacted, would have on the Company. The Company believes that such regulations would be enacted over time and would affect the industry as a whole.
Climate change may impact the Company’s business by increasing operating costs due to damage to its facilities and distribution systems and disruptions to its manufacturing processes due to the increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, fog, mist, freezing conditions, sea-level rise and other climate-related events. As discussed above, climate change-related regulatory activity and developments may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results by requiring the Company to reduce its emissions, make capital investments to modernize certain aspects of its operations, purchase carbon offsets, or otherwise pay for its emissions. The Company seeks to address these potential risks in its business continuity planning; however, such events could make it difficult for the Company to deliver products and services to its customers and cause it to incur substantial expense.
 The Company is committed to supporting environmental, social and governance ("ESG") initiatives and to its efforts to being a responsible and sustainable contributor to the environment, its employees, and the communities in which it operates. The Company is committed to reducing harmful air emissions, improving gas, electric and water usage efficiency while implementing alternative energy sources. The Company’s locations are also focused on efforts to reduce its waste, water and energy consumption through the implementation of such programs as pollution prevention, recycling waste materials in both manufacturing and office facilities, reducing solid waste disposal, reducing harmful air emissions, and implementing alternative energy sources. An example of this commitment is through solar power installations at some of the Company’s locations around the globe which are currently generating 1.4 megawatts of power. The Company has also installed more efficient LED lighting at many of its operations to further reduce energy usage. Some locations have also achieved the ISO-14001: Environmental Management Systems Certification. The Company has adopted several policies, including the Code of Conduct, which stresses the importance of adhering to the laws and contributing to society.
In addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, the Company is also committed to sustainability and environmental protection initiatives. For example, the Company is committed to protecting wildlife by working with utility companies to design and manufacture wildlife protection products that aid in reducing wildlife mortalities from interaction with electric power distribution lines, structures, and equipment. Its Wildlife Protection line of products includes the BIRD-FLIGHT Diverter, RAPTOR PROTECTOR Platform and a Squirrel Deterrent System. The Company is also committed to partnering with its customers to develop innovative products, technologies, and services that meet their needs while mitigating risk to the environment and natural resources.


Additionally, the Company's product offerings further enhance global climate sustainability by bolstering grid reliability and efficiency, strengthening resilience to climate events, enabling transitions to renewable energy and upgrading aging infrastructure. The Company also quickly provides repair products to customers in the event of emergencies or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods or ice storms.
The Company has always supported numerous charitable organizations and promotes community involvement. It makes donations to various organizations and encourages employees to do the same by offering matching donations. The Company shares its successes with the communities in which it operates at both a corporate and local level. Donations and investments in enhancing the lives of the people within the communities it impacts are an integral part of who the Company is and how it intends to represent its values.
 Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, the Company had 2,927 employees, the overwhelming majority of which are full-time employees. Approximately 28% of the Company’s employees are located in the U.S.
The Company views its employees and culture as keys to its success and believes that its employees are its greatest asset. The Company aims to attract and retain employees who will be empowered to have the freedom to make decisions and take actions in the best interest of the Company, while being recognized and accountable for those decisions and actions. The Company focuses on innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety and engagement to develop the best talent.
The Company’s goal is to create a work environment that enables employees to perform in an environment where they feel respected and valued.
