Item 1.  BusinessReorganization Agreement
 On September 6, 2016, BlackRidge Technology International, Inc. and BlackRidge Technology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, or “BlackRidge”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement") originally dated as of September 6, 2016 and amended on February 22, 2017 to update the number of common shares, warrants, and options granted and outstanding as of the closing date.

On February 22, 2017, we completed the actions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement and merged with and into BlackRidge with BlackRidge continuing as the surviving corporation (“Reorganization”). Upon completion of the Agreement, we issued 3,783,791 shares of our newly designated Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares of Common Stock to the stockholders of BlackRidge in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock of BlackRidge.  Additionally, certain stockholders of the Company returned for cancellation a total of 16,284,330 shares of our Common Stock.  Upon the completion of the Reorganization, BlackRidge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company had a total of 3,783,791 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 21,790,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding, with the former BlackRidge stockholders owning 3,783,791 shares or 100% of Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares or approximately 58.9% of Common Stock.  Upon completion of the Reorganization, we also had outstanding warrants entitling the holders to acquire a total of 18,541,579 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an average exercise price of $0.46 per share.  The Reorganization resulted in a change of control of the Company.  For accounting purposes, BlackRidge will be treated as the acquirer and the historical financial statements of BlackRidge will become the Company's historical financial statements.  The acquisition is intended to constitute a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 At the closing of the Reorganization, Robert Graham was appointed as President, and John Bluher was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary.  In addition, Bruce Crane resigned from his position as a director and Robert Graham was appointed as a director of the Company to fill the vacancy created by such resignation.  John Hofman, our remaining director, resigned from such position effective following our compliance with rule 14f-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and John Hayes and Robert Lentz were appointed as directors of the Company effective at such time as Mr. Hofman's resignation became effective. 
On March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of substantially all assets, other than cash, used in or connection with the Company's home grain mill and kitchen mixer business to John Hofman and Bruce Crane, former officers and directors of the Company, in consideration for the assumption by such persons of substantially all the liabilities incurred by the Company in connection with such business.  The assets divested consisted of the non-cybersecurity assets of the Company and included accounts receivable, inventory, deposits, property and equipment and intangible assets.  The liabilities divested included the non-cybersecurity liabilities of the Company and included accounts payable and accrued expenses and long and short-term notes payable and accrued interest thereon.  
On July 2, 2017, the Company filed Restated Articles with the Secretary of State of Nevada to, among other things, change the Company’s name to BlackRidge Technology International, Inc.

Overview
 BlackRidge Technology International Inc., a Nevada company, headquartered in Reno Nevada, was incorporated in April 2010 under the name “Grote Molen, Inc.” to commercialize its military grade and patented network security technology.
BlackRidge develops and markets next generation cyber defense solutions that enables our customers to deliver more secure and resilient business services in today’s rapidly evolving cyber threat environments. Our network, server, IoT and cloud security products are based on our patented Transport Access Control technology and are designed to isolate, cloak and protect cloud services, enterprise servers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and segment and segregate enterprise Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks from cyber-attacks and unauthenticated access. BlackRidge products are used in enterprise and government computing environments, the industrial IoT, critical infrastructure and other cloud service provider and network systems. 
The general telephone number for BlackRidge is 1-855-807-8776 and our website is www.blackridge.us.
Business 
The Company develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide a next generation cyber security solution for protecting enterprise networks and cloud services, and more recently, healthcare, industrial controls and critical infrastructure systems. With our patented technology, network connected devices and server resources located in the enterprise and datacenters, factory and hospital floors, and cloud systems are better protected, less expensive to protect, and less vulnerable to compromise from cyber-attacks and insider threats. We believe that our identity-based approach to cyber defense offers superior performance compared to legacy network security approaches and greatly reduces business risk and operational costs for organizations by eliminating malicious and unwanted traffic from their networks and systems.
 BlackRidge and our partners sell network security products and solutions based on our proprietary BlackRidge Transport Access Control (TAC) software. BlackRidge “TAC” provides high throughput and low latency network security that operates pre-session, in real time, before other security defenses engage. BlackRidge products can be deployed inside an IT or OT network or a cloud to cloak and protect servers and IoT devices and segment networks, in front of existing security stacks to filter anonymous traffic, or as part of cloud or managed service provider or OEM (as defined below) solutions. 
The Company believes its technology is first to market with an authenticated identity-based approach of addressing this implicit trust problem in networks, that is now commonly called “zero trust” network environments. BlackRidge TAC authenticates identity before allowing a network connection to proceed to ensure that only identified and authorized users are allowed to establish network connections.
 Technology and Products 
Our proprietary and patented technology, TAC, authenticates user or device identity and applies security policies across networks and cloud services before application sessions are established. Underlying BlackRidge TAC is our patented First Packet Authentication™ which conveys and authenticates identity in the "first packet" of a TCP network session request. This fundamental invention addresses the trust model in how the Internet operates: the inability to authenticate network traffic sources and network connections. Without authentication, unidentified and unauthorized users and devices can scan, probe and access networks and cloud services. This implicit trust security gap is exploited in all cyber-attacks through the process of network scanning and reconnaissance, and it has been further exposed and magnified by cloud services, mobile connectivity, and the IoT. 
BlackRidge products provide advanced identity-based cyber defense capabilities compared to advanced firewalls and VPNs in applications such as network segmentation, software defined networks, and protecting cloud services, IoT, and critical infrastructure devices. BlackRidge conceals network resources from network mapping, reconnaissance and other forms of unauthorized access and attacks which cannot be blocked by advanced firewalls or malware detection systems. This significantly reduces their cyber-attack surface which is the ability for their systems to be found and attacked. Furthermore, unlike VPN and tunneling technologies that encrypt network traffic, our solution enables customers to continue to use their advanced analytical and machine learning tools. This is also important for Industrial Control Systems and IIoT environments that need to deploy advanced IoT analytics tools to support digital transformation and automation initiatives such as condition-based monitoring.

For Industrial IoT and critical infrastructure environments, BlackRidge products effectively let organizations establish end-to-end trust by transporting authenticated identity through the stack – across already installed sensors to clouds and IoT analytics servers – cost effectively and with minimal latency added to the network. This ability to add security to legacy or brownfield environments addresses the risk of the increasing attack surface from the convergence of Operational Technology with IT networks. Organizations tasked with operating and managing factory automation or critical infrastructure systems can now secure legacy equipment long shelf life and known vulnerabilities. 
The BlackRidge solution is available in the following product configurations, with additional platform support and endpoints under development: 

● | 1U rack-mountable 1GbE or 10GbE network appliance; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 1GbE fanless desktop appliance; 
● | VMware ESXi™, KVM, and IBM z/VM® virtual appliances; 
● | Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure cloud virtual appliances; and
● | Windows and Linux software endpoints; and 
● | IoT endpoints and devices. 

 
 BlackRidge products are priced and licensed per gateway appliance or endpoint device, and on the total number of user and device identities supported in an implementation. We offer annual subscription pricing at a preferred rate with perpetual, enterprise site and Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) licensing also available. BlackRidge gateways can support up to 100,000 identities and 4,000,000 sessions, providing a highly scalable enterprise solution that operates with low latency and high throughput compared to current network security devices. Network and cloud deployments options include deploying in-line as a network protection or segmentation device or logically inline for cloud deployments. BlackRidge’s software and systems are designed to be highly resilient and can be configured for high availability and failover. Deployment risk is addressed by monitoring and verifying security policies during deployment with progressive modes of bridge, monitor and audit, and then enforce policy; and by logging all policy enforcement actions.
 Our products are protected by multiple U.S. Patents including "First Packet Authentication," "Concealing a Network Connected Device," "Digital Identity Authentication," and "Statistical Object Identification," and "Method for Directing Requests to Trusted Resources."

Markets, Customers and Distribution Channels
The BlackRidge network security and adaptive cyber defense solution is broadly applicable to virtually all enterprise, government and industrial control, and critical infrastructure or utility market segments. Whether deployed directly in a customer's environment or embedded as part of partner’s cloud service or solution, BlackRidge products provide a new level of cyber defense not available in the market today. 
BlackRidge markets and sells its products to government and commercial users through multiple channels, including direct sales, integrator and reseller channel partners, cloud and managed service providers, and through strategic OEM partners. The initial sales focus and market entry strategy for BlackRidge was the U.S. Department of Defense, which is a key leverage point for the company's current commercial, government, and international sales efforts. Our customers and strategic technology partners include Cisco, Federal Resources, healthcare providers such as ImagineMed, IBM, I-NET, Marist College, Microsoft, National Instruments, Oracle, PTC, SafeLogic, Splunk, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, and VMware. Our global channel partners include Atrion, B&D Consulting, LRS IT Solutions, Network Runners, Nihon Cornet Technology, NTT AT, and Presidio. 
Within the commercial markets, BlackRidge sells both direct and through our strategic partners to large enterprise accounts, and indirect through certain channel partners to specific verticals and international market segments. Our initial market entry strategy for the commercial market is to sell direct in order to establish customer references with large enterprises that have high security and compliance requirements.  These include more complex regulated enterprises such as Financial Services, Healthcare, Insurance, Manufacturing and Utility companies. Our channel partners are recruited to expand enterprise sales, commercializing specific vertical markets, and penetrating the international markets. Revenue from commercial sales includes subscription and perpetual product licensing fees, installation services, and annual support based on a standard price list. 
In the government markets, BlackRidge sells its standard commercial products through a wholly owned subsidiary, BlackRidge Technology Government, to government resellers, integrators and contractors who resell to the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies. BlackRidge’s government revenue is net of government discounts, contracting fees, and channel and service partner discounts. BlackRidge has been involved with the DOD for over nine years, including our initial product development funding which was provided by the U.S. DOD. The BlackRidge products have been designed for several large DOD programs and they have been extensively tested and validated for use by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) labs and other agencies. 
In 2018 we achieved several significant product milestones with the DOD including receiving Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) certification, and our TAC gateway was certified and added to the Department of Defense Information Network Approved Products List (DoDIN APL). This DoDIN APL designation identifies products that have completed interoperability and cyber security certification via a rigorous testing process, and it allows the DoD both domestic and abroad to purchase and operate BlackRidge products within DoD networks.
 The BlackRidge OEM and service provider partnership strategy is to make targeted investments to capitalize on opportunities in specific market segments such as the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain networks, and cloud solution providers. For these markets and our partners, BlackRidge TAC can be deployed as an integrated or embedded capability in the partners' equipment and vertical market solutions and sold and supported by our partner. BlackRidge provides unique, integrated identity-based cyber defense for these OEM products or service offerings that provides their end user customer with a competitive market advantage in the face of today's advanced cyber threats. Revenue from OEM offerings flows from embedded product licensing fees and support fees and add-on product sales that are somewhat unique to each OEM offering.

Competition
BlackRidge TAC operates at the Transport Layer to provide a highly scalable, non-interactive authentication protocol that does not rely on signatures, sandboxing, or deep packet inspection of content. This provides key competitive differentiators including high through-put with very low latency, compatibility with existing network and security technologies, address and topology independent, ability to work with encrypted content, and it supports cloud environments with network address translation (NAT). 
 We compete with other technology research and development, and sales companies for enterprise security spending and for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing companies in our field of endeavor may impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or further acquisitions, if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their technologies, or the advanced stage of marketing or development or the price of the investment opportunity. We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and products) obsolete.

These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 
● | significantly greater name recognition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | established distribution networks; 
● | more advanced technologies and product development; 
● | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives; and 
● | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, and obtaining regulatory approval for products.

    Our commercial success depends on our ability to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to, safety, price, marketing and distribution. There can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing products that are more effective than our cyber security technology, therefore rendering our products obsolete and noncompetitive.  Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we believe we need to create a public relations/advertising program designed to establish our “brand” name recognition; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts.
Our strategy drives the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development.  Competition with respect to our technologies is and will be based, among other things, on effectiveness, latency, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any new versions of the software or development of new products and cyber security solutions new markets such industrial control systems (ICS) and the Industrial IoT.
 Accordingly, the speed with which we can distribute and sell products and the speed to market with new or updated versions of the existing software, complete testing and proof of concept processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of our products to the market and channels is expected to be an important competitive factor.
 Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often-substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.

Cybersecurity Enterprise Risk Management
The BlackRidge cybersecurity Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is an Office of Information Security (OIS) program comprised of established policies, procedures and controls.  The backbone of the program applies approved techniques to measure cyber risk and respond with controls to mitigate those risks.   Measurement of risk is executed by trained cyber security staff.  Each risk is calculated using industry norm values (Severity, Occurrence, Detection) which produces a Risk Priority Number (RPN).  The entire portfolio of risks is organized into a four-block configuration visibly denoting actions to Improve, Optimize, Monitor or Accept each individual risk.  The aggregate of risk visualization data is a dynamic representation for review by various corporate constituencies. 
Current consumers of BlackRidge aggregated corporate cybersecurity program are Audit / Finance, CVP Internal Audit, CEO, BlackRidge ERM management team and the engineering group.  Each entity in turn provides specific feedback relative to the consumption of the data.  The feedback is used to normalize the data and subsequently provide inputs to design and implementation of controls to maintain risk at an acceptable corporate level.  As controls are applied continually, measurements and reevaluations are taken by the OIS team at various intervals across the spectrum of risk to ensure applied controls are effective and stabilizing to the agreed corporate risk tolerance.  The evolution of the OIS ERM program strives for the right balance of control to maintain security, while also providing continuous improvement to the BlackRidge Governance, Risk, Compliance and Security Programs.
