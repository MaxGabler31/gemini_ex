COMPANY OVERVIEW
At Alliance One, we believe everything we do is to transform people’s lives so that together we can grow a better world. A 145-year-old agricultural company, Alliance One provides responsibly-produced, independently verified, sustainable and traceable agricultural products, ingredients and services to businesses and customers. Headquartered in the Research Triangle Park region of North Carolina, we contract with growers across five continents to help them produce sustainable, compliant crops. 
We are committed to responsible crop production which supports economic viability for the grower, provides a safe working atmosphere for those involved in crop production and minimizes negative environmental impact. Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with growers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. Throughout the entire production process, from seed through processing and final shipment, our traceability systems provide clear visibility into how products are produced at every step of the supply chain, supporting product integrity. 
Historically, Alliance One’s core business has been as a tobacco leaf merchant, purchasing, processing, packing, storing and shipping tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products throughout the world. Through our predecessor companies, we have a long operating history in the leaf tobacco industry with some customer relationships beginning in the early 1900s. In an increasing number of markets, we also provide agronomy expertise for growing leaf tobacco. Our contracted tobacco grower base often produces a significant volume of non-tobacco crop utilizing the agronomic assistance that our team provides. Alliance One is working to find markets for these crops as part of our ongoing efforts to improve farmer livelihoods and the communities in which they live. 
As we announced in February 2018, we began a transformation process that would allow the Company to diversify its products and services by leveraging its core strengths in agronomy and traceability. In addition to our existing 50% interest in Purilum, LLC, a U.S. company that develops, produces, and sells consumable e-liquids to manufacturers and distributors of e-vapor products, on August 21, 2017, the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Nicotine River, LLC, a manufacturer, retailer and wholesale supplier of compounds used for e-liquid production. On April 2, 2018, we purchased a 51% interest in Humble Juice, LLC, a manufacturer and distributor of e-liquids. On December 18, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Criticality LLC ("Criticality"), a North Carolina-based industrial hemp company to engage in cannabidiol ("CBD") extraction and other applications for industrial hemp in accordance with a pilot program authorized under the federal Agriculture Act of 2014 and applicable North Carolina law. On January 25, 2018, a Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired a 75% equity position in Canada’s Island Garden Inc. (“CIG”). CIG is fully licensed to produce and sell medicinal cannabis in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. CIG sells its products in Canada directly to patients and through distributors. In January, 2018, CIG signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the province of Prince Edward Island to be one of three suppliers under the provincial Cannabis Board. On January 29, 2018, the same Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired an 80% equity position in Goldleaf Pharm Inc. ("Goldleaf"), a late-stage applicant to produce and sell medicinal cannabis located in the Canadian province of Ontario. In general, our diversification focuses on products that are value-added, require some degree of processing and play well to our strengths as well as offering higher margin potential than our core tobacco leaf business.
To support these business lines, we have broad geographic processing capabilities, a diversified product offering, an established customer base for our core business and a growing customer base for our new business lines. We intend to continue broadening our business portfolio over the next three to four years by focusing on consumer-driven agricultural products. Because certain of these diversification investments are accounted for under the equity method and others were made only recently and involve early-stage businesses, our core leaf tobacco operations continued to account for almost all of our revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. It is our plan that, as these new businesses further develop and we pursue other diversification opportunities, these business lines will begin to meaningfully contribute to future years’ revenues with a more significant impact toward profitability.

Leaf Tobacco Operations. Our tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to these manufacturers of tobacco products. Processing and other revenues are less than 5% of our total revenues. We deal primarily in flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos that are used in international brand cigarettes. 
Tobacco is purchased in more than 35 countries and shipped to approximately 90 countries. Tobacco is primarily purchased directly from suppliers with small quantities still purchased at auction. In non-auction markets, we purchase tobacco directly from suppliers and we assume the risk of matching the quantities and grades required by our customers to the entire crop we must purchase under contract. In other non-auction markets, such as China, we buy tobacco from local entities that have purchased tobacco from suppliers and supervise the processing of that tobacco by those local entities. Principal auction markets include India, Malawi and Zimbabwe and our network of tobacco operations and buyers allows us to cover the major auctions of flue-cured and burley tobacco throughout the world. In the United States and other locations, a number of our customers purchase tobacco directly from the suppliers in addition to the leaf merchants. Although our facilities process the tobacco purchased directly from suppliers by these customers, we do not take ownership of that tobacco and do not record sales revenues associated with its resale. Our arrangements with suppliers vary from locale to locale depending on our predictions of future supply and demand, local historical practice and availability of capital. In certain jurisdictions, we purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and other products related to growing tobacco and advance them to suppliers, which represents prepaid inventory. The suppliers then utilize these inputs to grow tobacco, which we are contractually obligated to purchase. The advances of inputs for the current crop generally include the original cost of the inputs plus a mark-up and interest as it is earned. Where contractually permitted, we charge interest to the suppliers during the period the current crop advance is outstanding. We generally advance inputs at a price greater than our cost, which results in a mark-up on the inputs. We account for our advances to tobacco suppliers using a cost accumulation model, which results in us reporting our advances at the lower of cost or recoverable amounts excluding the mark-up and interest. The mark-up and interest on our advances are recognized when the tobacco is delivered as a decrease in our cost of the current crop. Upon delivery of tobacco, part of the purchase price paid to the supplier is paid in cash and part through a reduction of the advance balance. The advances applied to the delivery are reclassified out of advances and into unprocessed inventory. We advance inputs only to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. For example, in Brazil, we generally contract to purchase a supplier's entire tobacco crop at the market price per grade at the time of harvest based on the quality of the tobacco delivered. Pursuant to these purchase contracts, we provide suppliers with fertilizer and other materials necessary to grow tobacco and may guarantee Brazilian rural credit loans to suppliers to finance the crop. Under longer-term arrangements with suppliers, we may advance or guarantee financing on suppliers' capital assets, which are also recovered through the delivery of tobacco to us by our suppliers.
In these jurisdictions, our agronomists maintain frequent contact with suppliers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. As a result of various factors including weather, not all suppliers are able to settle the entire amount of advances through delivery of tobacco in a given crop year. Throughout the crop cycle, we monitor events that may impact the suppliers’ ability to deliver tobacco. If we determine we will not be able to recover the original cost of the advances with deliveries of the current crop, or future crop deliveries, the unit cost of tobacco actually received is increased when unrecoverable costs are within a normal range which is based on our historical results or expensed immediately when they are above a normal range based on our historical results. We account for the unrecoverable costs in this manner to ensure only costs within a normal range are capitalized in inventory and costs that are above a normal range are expensed immediately as current period charges.
Alliance One has developed an extensive international network through which we purchase, process and sell tobacco and we hold a leading position in most tobacco growing regions in the world. We purchase tobacco in more than 35 countries. During the three years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 25%, 24%, and 24%, respectively, of our purchases of tobacco were from the North America operating segment and approximately 75%, 76%, and 76%, respectively, were from the Other Regions operating segment. Within the Other Regions operating segment, approximately 61%, 60%, and 61% of our total purchases for the three years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, were from China, Brazil, Turkey, and the Africa Region.
We process tobacco to meet each customer's specifications as to quality, yield, chemistry, particle size, moisture content and other characteristics. Unprocessed tobacco is a semi-perishable commodity that generally must be processed within a relatively short period of time to prevent fermentation or deterioration in quality. The processing of leaf tobacco facilitates shipping and prevents spoilage and is an essential service to our customers because the quality of processed leaf tobacco substantially affects the quality of the manufacturer’s end product. Accordingly, we have located our production facilities in proximity to our principal sources of tobacco.
We process tobacco in more than 34 owned and third-party facilities around the world including Argentina, Brazil, China, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Guatemala, India, Tanzania, the United States, Malawi, Thailand, Germany, Indonesia, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey. These facilities encompass all leading export locations of flue-cured, burley and oriental tobaccos. In addition, we have entered into contracts, joint ventures and other arrangements for the purchase of tobacco grown in substantially all other countries that produce export-quality flue-cured and burley tobacco.
Upon arrival at our processing plants, flue-cured and burley tobacco is first reclassified according to grade. Most of that tobacco is then blended to meet customer specifications regarding color, body and chemistry, threshed to remove the stem from the leaf and further processed to produce strips of tobacco and sieve out small scrap. We also sell a small amount of processed but unthreshed flue-cured and burley tobacco in loose-leaf and bundle form to certain customers. Oriental tobaccos are handled and processed in a similar manner other than that the tobaccos are not threshed to remove stems.

Leaf Tobacco Operations (continued). Processed flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco is redried to remove excess moisture so that it can be held in storage by customers or us for long periods of time. After redrying, whole leaves, bundles, strips or stems and scrap where applicable are separately packed in cases, bales, cartons or hogsheads for storage and shipment. Packed flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco generally is transported in the country of origin by truck or rail, and exports are moved by ship. Prior to and during processing, steps are taken to ensure consistent quality of the tobacco, including the regrading and removal of undesirable leaves, dirt and other non-tobacco related material. Customer representatives are frequently present at our facilities to monitor the processing of their particular orders. Throughout the processing, our technicians use quality control laboratory test equipment to ensure that the product meets all customer specifications.
Key Customers. In our leaf tobacco business, our primary customers are major tobacco product manufacturers. The consumer tobacco business is dominated by a relatively small number of large multinational cigarette manufacturers and by government controlled entities. Including their respective affiliates, accounting for more than 10% of our revenues were each of Philip Morris International, Inc. ("PMI"), China Tobacco International, Inc. and Imperial Brands, PLC for the year ended March 31, 2018 and PMI and China Tobacco International, Inc. for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
In the 2018 fiscal year, Alliance One delivered approximately 39% of its tobacco sales to customers in Europe and approximately 16% to customers in the United States. One customer directs shipments to its Belgium storage and distribution center before shipment to its manufacturing facilities in Europe and Asia. In the 2018 fiscal year, these Belgium sales accounted for 7% of total sales. The remaining sales of leaf tobacco are to customers located in Asia, Africa and other geographic regions of the world.
Competition. Alliance One is one of only two global, publicly held leaf tobacco merchants, each with similar global market shares. We hold a leading position in most major tobacco growing regions in the world, including the principal export markets for flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco and, as a result of our scale, global reach, and financial resources, we believe we are well-suited to serve the needs of all manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products. The leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive and competition is based primarily on the price charged for products and services as well as the merchant's ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, residue compliance and financing of tobacco. In addition to the primary global independent leaf tobacco merchants, there are a number of other independent global, regional or national competitors. Local independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead also supply cigarette manufacturers. Recent vertical integration initiatives and other changes in customer buying patterns have resulted in a more dynamic and competitive operating environment. There is also competition in all countries to buy the available leaf tobacco and, in many areas, total leaf tobacco processing capacity exceeds demand.
Competition in our new business lines continues to evolve, but is generally based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer and customer preferences.
Seasonality. The purchasing and processing activities of our agricultural business are seasonal. With regards to tobacco, purchases vary by market and tobacco variety. Flue-cured tobacco grown in the United States is purchased, processed and marketed generally during the five-month period beginning in July and ending in November. U.S. grown burley tobacco is purchased, processed and marketed usually from late November through January or February. Tobacco grown in Brazil is usually purchased, processed and marketed from January through July and in Africa from April through September.
Other tobacco markets around the world have similar purchasing periods, although at different times of the year. During the purchasing, processing and marketing seasons, inventories of unprocessed tobacco, inventories of redried tobacco and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession. Current liabilities, particularly advances from customers and short-term notes payable to banks, normally reach their peak in this period as a means of financing the seasonal expansion of current assets. At March 31, the end of our fiscal year, the seasonal components of our working capital reflect primarily the operations related to foreign-grown tobacco.
Reportable Segments. For our leaf tobacco business, the purchasing, processing, selling and storing of tobacco is similar throughout our business. However, we maintain regional operating and financial management in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia to monitor our various operations in these areas. In reviewing these operations, we have concluded that the economic characteristics of North America are dissimilar from the other operating regions. Based on this fact, we disclose North America separately and aggregate the remaining four operating segments, Africa, Asia, Europe and South America into one reportable segment “Other Regions.” Our financial performance is reviewed at this level and these regions represent our operating segments. The investments in new business lines as part of our transformation process (other than our investments in entities accounted for under the equity method) are being reported in the Other Regions reportable segment. See Note 14 “Segment Information” to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial information attributable to our reportable segments.

OTHER
Research and Development. We routinely cooperate with both our customers and the manufacturers of the equipment used in our processing facilities to improve processing technologies. However, no material amounts are expended for research and development, and we hold no material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.
Alliance One Employees. Alliance One's consolidated entities employed approximately 3,450 persons, excluding seasonal employees, in our worldwide operations at March 31, 2018. In the Other Regions operating segment, Alliance One's consolidated entities employed approximately 2,854 employees at March 31, 2018, excluding approximately 5,377 seasonal employees. Most seasonal employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the North America operating segment, Alliance One's consolidated entities employed approximately 596 employees at March 31, 2018, excluding approximately 171 seasonal employees. Most seasonal employees, as well as approximately 222 full-time factory personnel in the United States, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider Alliance One's employee relations to be satisfactory. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Compliance.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of government regulation. Currently, there are no material estimated capital expenditures related to environmental control facilities. In addition, there is no material effect on capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position anticipated as a result of compliance with current or pending federal or state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment.
