ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
General Description of the Business
 
mPhase Technologies, Inc. (“mPhase” or the “Company”) is a publicly-held New Jersey corporation. The Company has approximately 23,000 shareholders and approximately 17,772,643,845 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The Company was founded in 1996 and its common stock is traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol XDSL. The Company had offices in Clifton, New Jersey as well as Norwalk, Connecticut during fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Beginning in July of 2017 the Company moved its office to Staten Island, New York.
 
The Company has faced a very challenging environment since March of 2016. Lack of available funds to pay its outside auditors and other transaction costs associated with timely filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) of its periodic financial statements has resulted in the Company being delinquent with respect to such filings starting with its Form 10Q for the 3-month period ended March 31, 2016. The Company is using its best efforts to secure funding required to complete all of its delinquent SEC filings and thereafter remain current with respect to such filings.
 
mPhase is a company specializing in the research, development and fabrication of “smart surfaces” using materials science engineering, and enabled by breakthroughs in nanotechnology science and the principles of microfluidics and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). The Company is developing products for both commercial and military applications. To date the Company has concentrated its efforts in Smart Surface Technology on research and development of its Smart Nanobattery.
 
As of June 30, 2017 the Company has a patent portfolio of 16 patents (licensed, solely and jointly owned), including patent applications pending or subject to reinstatement, in the United States. The patents cover our battery products and our Smart Surfaces Technology –an innovative platform to control the flow of fluids by manipulating the ways liquids behave when in contact with a solid or porous surface.
 
The Company’s first application, using its Smart Surface technology, is a Smart NanoBattery providing Power On Command™. The patent pending and patented battery technology, based on the phenomenon of electrowetting, offers an innovative way to store energy and manage power. Features of the Smart NanoBattery include potentially infinite shelf life prior to initial activation, environmentally friendly design, fast ramp to power, programmable control, and direct integration with microelectronic devices. The platform technology behind the Smart NanoBattery is a porous nanostructured material used to repel and precisely control the flow of liquids. The material has a Smart Surface that can potentially be designed for other innovative products such as a transdermal smart drug delivery system. 
 
mPhase completed a Phase I and Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) grant, part of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, with the U.S. Army for development of a reserve Smart NanoBattery for a critical computer memory application. Such reserve battery can be activated by an electronic pulse. The Army has also successfully tested the Smart NanoBattery as an energy source activated by g forces to provide power to a telemetry system for guidance of small munitions.
 
The Smart NanoBattery and Smart Surface technology is still in development and has not reached a commercialization stage.
 
In a separate effort, mPhase introduced, through mPower Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, a product line of four emergency portable jumpstarters for the automotive/marine industries. The following products of mPower Technologies, Inc. generated totals of $20,516 and $523,116 in revenue for the Company in the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2017 & 2016.
 
In April of 2016, the Company began to wind-down and discontinue this entire product line of Jump Starters and Related Products sold through its subsidiary mPower Technologies, Inc. due to increased competition, contracting margins, and lack of funds to purchase substantial inventory, resulting in purchase volume discounts (See “Subsequent Events” describing the Company’s termination of its entire line of mPower Technologies, Inc products in order to conserve financial resources).

Description of Operations
 
Microfluidics, MEMS, and Nanotechnology
 
In February of 2004, mPhase entered the business of materials science engineering developing new products based on materials whose properties and behavior are controlled at the micrometer and nanometer scales. (For reference, a micrometer or micron is equal one millionth (10-6) of a meter and a nanometer is one billionth (10-9) of a meter – the scale of atoms and molecules. A human hair is approximately 50 microns in diameter, or 50,000 nanometers thick.)
 
The Company has expertise and capabilities in microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and nanotechnology. Microfluidics refers to the behavior, precise control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically micrometer scale. MEMS is the integration of mechanical elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a common silicon substrate through microfabrication technology. Nanotechnology is the creation of functional materials, devices and systems through control of matter (atoms and molecules) on the nanometer length scale (1-100 nanometers), and exploitation of novel phenomena and properties (physical, chemical, biological, mechanical, electrical) at that length scale.
 
In its Smart NanoBattery, mPhase exploits the physical phenomenon of electrowetting by which a voltage is used to change the wetting properties of a liquid/solid interface at the nanometer scale. Through electrowetting, mPhase can change a surface from what is referred to as a hydrophobic (“liquid repelling”) state to a hydrophilic (“liquid attracting”) state. In the hydrophobic state, the liquid beads up or is repelled by the surface. In the hydrophilic state, the liquid spreads out or is absorbed by the surface. The ability to electronically control the wetting characteristics of a surface at the nanometer scale is the core of mPhase’s nanotechnology operations and intellectual property portfolio.
 
In the Smart NanoBattery application, mPhase uses electrowetting as a new technique to activate or literally “turn on” a battery once it is ready to be used for the first time. At the heart of the Smart NanoBattery is a porous, nanostructured superhydrophic or superlyophobic membrane designed and fabricated by mPhase. The so-called superhydrophobic membrane applies to water and the superlyophobic membrane applies to nonaqueous or organic liquids such as ethanol or mineral oil. The difference between the two membrane types lies in the nanoscale architecture at the surface. By virtue of its superhydrophobic or superlyophobic character, the membrane, although porous, can physically separate the liquid electrolyte from the solid electrodes so that the battery remains dormant or inactive, thus providing no voltage, or current until called upon.
 
This electrolyte-electrode separation gives the battery the feature of potentially unlimited shelf life and the benefit of being always ready when needed, which is not necessarily the case for conventional batteries. Electrowetting alters the liquid/membrane interface so that the liquid is now able to flow over the membrane’s surface and rapidly move through the pores where it can contact the solid electrode materials located on the other side of the membrane. mPhase uses MEMS, to precisely control the machining of silicon-based materials at the micrometer and nanometer scales. This ability has led to the Company’s proprietary membrane design that controls the wetting and movement of liquids on a solid surface. mPhase uses microfluidics to control the flow of liquid electrolyte through the porous membrane and is also the basis for other possible applications such as drug delivery and water filtration systems.
 
History of Nanotechnology Operations
 
Smart NanoBattery
 
mPhase Technologies, along with Bell Labs, jointly conducted research from February 2004 through April of 2007 that demonstrated control and manipulation of fluids on superhydrophobic and superlyophobic surfaces to create a new type of battery or energy storage device with power management features obtained by controlling the wetting behavior of a liquid electrolyte on a solid surface. The scientific research conducted set the ground work for continued development of the Smart NanoBattery and forms a potential path to commercialization of the technology for a broad range of market opportunities. The Company began its efforts by entering into a $1.2 million 12-month Development Agreement in February of 2004 with the Bell Labs division of Alcatel/Lucent for exploratory research of control and manipulation of fluids on superhydrophobic surfaces to create power cells (batteries) by controlling wetting behavior of an electrolyte on nanostructured electrode surfaces. The goal was to develop a major breakthrough in battery technology creating batteries with longer shelf lives as the result of no direct electrode contact (meaning no power drain prior to activation). During 2005 and 2006, the battery team tested modifications and enhancements to the internal design of the battery to optimize its power and energy density characteristics, as well as making engineering improvements that were essential in moving the battery from a zinc-based chemistry to a commercial lithium-based chemistry that can be manufactured on a large scale. The Company extended its development effort twice for an additional 2-year period ending in March of 2007 and for two additional periods thereafter through July 31, 2007. During this time, the technical focus shifted from trying to separate the liquid electrolyte from nanostructured electrodes to developing a nanostructured membrane that could physically separate the liquid electrolyte from the solid electrodes. Future development of the Smart NanoBattery is subject to the Company obtaining additional financing in the capital markets.

In addition beginning in February of 2005, mPhase contracted with Bell Labs to develop a magnetometer using the science of nanotechnology. The Company suspended development of this product in 2007 in order to conserve financial resources and focus its nanotechnology efforts primarily on development of innovative battery products.
 
mPhase also began working with the Rutgers University Energy Storage Research Group (ESRG) in July of 2005 to conduct contract research in advanced battery chemistries involving lithium. This work involved characterizing and testing materials that could be used in the mPhase battery. In July of 2007, the relationship shifted to a collaboration focused on developing a memory backup battery needed by the U.S. Army. The work was funded through a Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) grant.
 
The Company decided in September of 2007 to transfer its development work out of Bell Labs (Alcatel/Lucent) in order to accelerate and broaden its nanotechnology product commercialization efforts. Bell Labs had engaged in its battery research and development for the Company for zinc-based batteries and was limited since it did not have facilities capable of handling lithium chemistry. mPhase shifted its work to Rutgers ESRG which had facilities capable of handling lithium-based batteries and also engaged in work with foundries and other companies to supply essential components, fabricate prototypes, and plan manufacturing approaches. These companies included Silex, a well-respected silicon foundry in Sweden, and Eagle Picher, a well-known battery designer and manufacturer that focuses on high-end batteries for military applications located in Joplin, Missouri.
 
In February of 2008, the Company announced that a prototype of its Smart NanoBattery was successfully deployed in a gun-fired test at the Aberdeen Proving Ground at Maryland. The test was conducted by the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) of Picatinny, New Jersey. The battery not only survived the harsh conditions of deployment at a gravitational force in excess of 45,000 g, but was also flawlessly activated in the process.
 
In March of 2008, mPhase announced that it had been invited to submit a proposal for a Phase II STTR grant based upon the successful work it had performed on the Phase I grant to develop a version of the Smart NanoBattery referred to as the multi-cell, micro-array reserve battery for a critical memory backup application. The Phase II grant in the gross amount of $750,000 (shared with Rutgers University which netted $500,000 to mPhase) was granted to the Company in the middle of September of 2008. In March of 2008, the Company also announced the successful transfer to a commercial foundry of certain processes critical to the manufacturing of its Smart NanoBattery. This enabled fabrication of the porous membranes for the multi-cell, micro-array reserve battery mentioned above. The Company successfully manufactured nanostructured membranes at the foundry that are essential to commercial production of the battery. By achieving a series of delayed activations, the shelf-life and continuous run-time of such battery can be increased to a period of time in excess of twenty years. In April of 2008, the Company announced that it had successfully activated it first Smart NanoBattery prototype by electrowetting using a hard-wired configuration and a remotely-activated device. Remote activation plays a key role in providing power to wireless sensors systems and radio frequency identification tags.
 
Also, in April of 2008, the Company announced that it had successfully produced its first lithium-based reserve battery with a soft or pouch package and breakable separator (in place of the electrowettable membrane) that relies on mechanical rather than electrical activation to provide Power On Command™. The Company believed that was a significant milestone in moving from a low energy density zinc-based battery to a higher energy density lithium-based battery.
 
In fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, the Company focused upon further development of its Smart NanoBattery under a Phase II STTR grant from the U.S. Army as a potential reserve battery for a back-up computer memory application. The Company has completed such Phase II Army grant. On November 12, of 2010, the Company announced that it had successfully triggered and activated its first functional multi-cell smart nanobattery. Triggering and activation of the cells of the battery were achieved by using the technique of electrowetting or programmable triggering. Triggering was accomplished by applying a pulse of electrical energy to a porous, smart surface membrane located inside each cell in the battery causing the electrolyte to come in contact with the cell’s electrodes, creating the chemical reaction to produce voltage inside of the multi-cell battery. The multi-cell battery consists of a matrix of 12 individual cells populated with an electrode stack consisting of lithium and carbon monofluoride materials with each rated at 3.0 volts. Using a custom designed circuit board for testing, each of the cells in the battery were independently triggered and activated without affecting any of the non-activated cells in the multi-cell configuration. Each cell in the battery has a very long shelf-life prior to triggering.
 
On February 9, 2011, the Company announced that it had signed a 3-year Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny, New Jersey, to continue to cooperatively test and evaluate the mPhase Smart NanoBattery, including new design features functionally appropriate for DoD based systems requiring portable power sources. The army researchers are evaluating the prototypes using the Army’s testing facilities at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey in order to determine applicability of the technology to gun fired munitions and potentially to incorporate the technologies into research and development and other programs sponsored by Picatinny. The Research Agreement is supported by the Fuze & Precision Armaments Technology Directorate.
 
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company completed work on its Phase II STTR grant for the U.S. army for a nano-reserve battery for a back-up computer memory application. In addition, the Company engaged First Principals, Inc. to perform an evaluation of each of its patents in order to identify a strategic partner whose products line will need the Company’s SmartNanoBattery as a compelling solution.

On March 6, 2012, the Company announced that it is exploring the printing of its Smart NanoBattery on graphene and other new advanced materials. Graphene is a very strong material that has been described as the most conductive material known, making it a vast improvement over silicon. Graphene has the potential to lead to faster, cheaper and more flexible devices including power sources. mPhase has suspended its exploration of the printing of its Smart NanoBattery on graphene. 
 
On August 16, 2012, the Company announced that it had received a notice of allowance for a patent from the U.S. patent office for a reserve battery utility patent. The techniques described in the patent are for creating a battery system that is easily activated via a low energy mechanical force, thus allowing the reserve battery to be used in a wide variety of consumer related and non-consumer related electrical devices. The invention generally relates to a reserve battery, which includes a battery case having an electrolyte compartment at a first end and an electrode compartment at a second end, a first terminal having an external button connected to the case at the first end, and a second terminal connected to the case at the second end. A movable ampoule is movably positioned within the electrolyte compartment. A bias member is located within the case between the external button and the ampoule, and a porous cutter is positioned within the case between the electrodes and the ampoule and supported by an inverted U-shaped support structure. When an external force is applied to the external button, the bias member transfers an internal force to the ampoule to cause the ampoule to engage the cutter and allow the electrolyte to release thus activating the battery.
 
On August 23, 2012, the Company announced that, subject to the availability of sufficient funding, it will engage in further development of its Smart NanoBattery to make it rechargeable.
 
On September 13, 2012, the Company announced that it had received a notice of allowance of a new patent from the U.S. patent office for a modular device. The invention generally relates to a handheld, powered device containing at least one power module having at least one battery, wherein the power module is removable and separately connects to each of the load modules. The patent covers a modular device for providing multiple modular components that may be interchanged as desired. A system for providing a modular device for use in emergency or everyday applications and having a plurality of modular components that are interchangeable with one another depending on the particular desired use.
 
On October 26, 2012, the Company announced the development of a prototype of a new product “the mPower Jump” designed by Porsche Design Studio and Porsche Engineering as an automatic jump starter for a dead car battery. The device is portable, light in weight and small in size designed to fit in the glove compartment of most cars.
 
On January 24, 2013, the Company announced that it had received a notice of allowance from the U.S. patent office of a patent covering a device for fluid spreading and transport. The invention relates to a single porous substrate formed from a network of filaments wherein the network of filaments is comprised of a first plurality of filaments and a second plurality of filaments is exposed to a surface modification treatment and the second plurality of filaments is covered with a conformal coating. A wetting region comprised of the first plurality of filaments extends through a first portion of the porous substrate and is permeable to fluid transport and a non-wetting region comprised of the second plurality of filaments which is operable to switch between a wetting and non-wetting state by an electrical source coupled to the second plurality of filaments. The invention protects a porous substrate with integrated wetting and non-wetting regions and is a key patent win for the Company relative to the protection of its intellectual property in the area of microfluid dynamics.
 
On January 30, 2013, the Company announced that it had received a patent from the U.S. patent office for a reserve battery system. The invention patented generally relates to a battery system that is easily activated via low mechanical force thus allowing a reserve battery to be used in a wide variety of consumer related and non-consumer related electrical devices.
 
On February 12, 2013, the Company announced that it has filed a United States Letter Patent application for a novel drug delivery system based on its Smart Surface technology. The drug delivery patent is based on mPhase’s Smart Surface technology electronically or manually enabling the precise control of a fluid on a nano-structured surface. The drug delivery system generally relates to a drug delivery system for automatically dispensing a preset dosage of a drug agent or medication.
 
On June 18, 2013, the Company announced that it had received the Frost & Sullivan award for its Innovative nanobattery technology.  Frost& Sullivan noted that the smart nanobattery is sustainable, cost-effective, easy to handle, and possesses a long shelf life, all of which clearly differentiate it from competing battery technologies. Frost & Sullivan further noted that this positions the technology to enhance the effectiveness of conventional batteries and encourage widespread use of reserve batteries.
 
On March 27, 2014 the Company entered into a three-year renewal of the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal of February of 2011. This agreement provides for further joint research and development of the Smart Nanobattery as a power source for smart munitions. The continuation of actual research and development under the CRADA is dependent upon the Company securing additional funding from either the capital markets or from various grant programs to be identified and applied for from the United States government.

On November 17, 2014 the Company announced an update on the drug delivery system patent application filed on February 12, 2013. In December of 2013 the patent office examiner indicated that a significant portion of the claim was patentable. On June 26, 2015 the USPTO issued a new Office Action rejecting the claims. A timely response was filed on September 28, 2015 making minor amendments to the claims to avoid newly cited prior art. The Company is seeking to have all of the claims patented. The drug delivery system utilizes the Company’s Smart Surface Technology.
 
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the Company, through its consumer subsidiary mPower Technologies, Inc., (“mPower”), successfully increased sales of the mPower Jump product as well as the mPower Mini Jump product. The mPower Jump is a rechargeable, compact device designed to jump start a dead battery in an automobile with engines up to 5 liters. The mPhase Jump is rechargeable in a significantly shorter period of time than lead acid jumpstarters and has a much smaller footprint, enabling it to fit in the glove compartment in most cars. The mPower Mini Jump, a smaller version of the product, about the size of a smart phone, is a multipurpose charger of batteries. It is designed to start dead batteries in recreational toys, such as all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, motorcycles and jet skis-even a full-size car with engines up to 2.5 liters. It is versatile enough to also charge small electronic devices including cell phones.
 
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, mPower began sales of the Jump Plus, a very powerful version of the Jump product line, powerful enough to jumpstart 12-volt vehicles with engines up to 6 liters. In addition, mPower introduced to the market and commenced sales of its mPower Truck Jump product designed to start dead batteries in most 12-volt battery systems, including trucks with engines up to 12 liters.
 
During the fiscal year beginning in July 2015 the Company experienced a significant decline in revenues and margins with respect of its jump starter products due to increased competition. The Company did not have purchasing power and financial strength significant enough to (a) obtain significant discounts from its main vendor of such products to lower cost, (b) carry a large volume on inventory of such products compared to its competitors or (c) maintain exclusivity of such products with its main vendor. As a result, the Company’s financial position became weaker and in April of 2016 the Company closed its office in Norwalk, Connecticut that had housed both inventory storage and distribution in order to conserve financial resources.
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 the Company received $12,500 for the sale of a patent and $18,000 from the sale of a vehicle to Mr. Dotoli and Debt cancellation of $18,000.
 
The Company has been unable to file its quarterly and annual reports with the SEC commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 owing to its overall lack of capital to pay its outside auditors and bear the various transaction costs associated with such filings. In the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017 the Company has begun an effort to become current in its SEC filings. The ability of the Company to successfully complete such filings will depend on its ability to raise sufficient funds to engage its outside auditors estimated to be $100,000 and related costs estimated to be $5,000.

DISCONTINUED BUSINESS-
 
Discontinuance of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) during Fiscal Year 2010
 
Historically, the Company, since its inception, had focused upon developing innovative solutions for the delivery of Broadcast Television as part of a “triple play” of services that would include voice and high-speed internet for telephone service providers globally. The Company, however, was not able to derive any significant revenue from its TV+ solution and no active development of the product has occurred since fiscal year 2007. The Company determined to discontinue this line of business and all inventory has been written off. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the Company formally elected, for financial reporting purposes to treat its IPTV product line as a discontinued business.
Discontinuance of Jump Stater Products during Fiscal Year 2016
 
As noted above, in April of 2016 the Company began discontinuing its operations in its wholly-owned subsidiary mPower Technologies, Inc. which was focused primarily on its line of jump starters for automotive and marine batteries in addition to its line of home generating battery products and its electric illuminator product developed with Porsche Design Studio. The Company is selling off its remaining inventory of such products in order to raise additional funds for working capital purposes and its presently very limited operations. (See Commencing in April of 2016, the Company began discontinuing its line of Jump Starter products owing to increased competition and declining margins. The Company continues the wind-down of its remaining inventory of such products estimated to have a value of $3,477 as of June 30, 2017 (See Note 3 caption- “discontinued operations”). 
Nanotechnology Products
 
Platform Technology
 
The surface is an important part of virtually every physical object and often plays an overriding role in many processes, beyond mere connectivity and structural support, but more deeply into areas involving chemical and biological interactions. In some instances, the surface provides an easy entry into the chemical or biological systems; in others it protects the internal elements of the object, surrounded by the surfaces.
 
mPhase’s current flagship platform technology is the Smart Surface. By being able to control the surface properties of materials down to the nanometer scale, new and improved devices can be designed and built that may lead to compelling business opportunities. One type of smart surface of particular interest allows properties to be changed in response to an external stimulus. 
 
Initially, mPhase’s development focused on Micro Electronic Mechanic Systems (MEMS) devices by manipulating the surface of silicon materials – the same material used to make microelectronic materials and devices. Using physical and chemical processes, the surface of the silicon is modified to make solid porous structures known as membranes. This is where microfluidics comes into play. These membranes can be used to selectively control the flow of liquids through the pores or openings at the micrometer length scale.
 
Surfaces may be characterized as hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on whether or not they attract or repel water (or other liquids). A hydrophilic surface can be wet and adsorbs water. A hydrophobic surface, on the other hand, cannot be wet. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are abundant in nature and in synthetic materials, both organic and inorganic in chemical composition. A familiar example of a hydrophilic surface is a sponge that readily soaks up water. By contrast, many plant leaves and flower petals are hydrophobic, as are insect parts and bird feathers. Synthetic hydrophobic surfaces include Scotchgard™ treated fabric, Teflon® coated metal, or Rain-X® coated glass. On a hydrophobic surface, water beads up and can move around without being absorbed by the solid material that it is resting on.
 
So-called superhydrophobic surfaces are also found in nature and can now be replicated in the lab. The lotus leaf and rose petal, for example, exhibit superhydrophobicity. Here water droplets form almost perfect spheres with hardly any contact with the underlying solid surface. This makes the liquid even easier to move and manipulate.
 
The synthesis of superhydrophobic surfaces has recently been made possible by advances in nanotechnology and mPhase is leading the way to better understand and create materials and devices incorporating these unique surface properties.
 
As mPhase’s research and development efforts evolve, in addition to silicon materials, the ability to control the surface properties of materials can be extended to other substances such as polymers, ceramics, metals, and fibers providing opportunities for our platform technology to be used in a range of potential applications such as energy storage and power management for portable electronics and microelectronics, self-cleaning surfaces, filters for water purification or desalination systems, materials for environmental remediation that separate liquids or solvents, and other situations where the control of the interaction of a solid surface exposed to a liquid is vitally important.

Smart NanoBattery
 
Battery technology has changed little in its fundamentals over the past 150 years. As a result, ordinary batteries begin dissipating energy as soon as they are assembled and therefore have limited shelf life. Chemistries are fixed inside the package so the user cannot interact with the contents to program functionality. The size and form of batteries have not kept pace with the miniaturization of electrical components, microprocessors and integrated circuits. As a result, the optimal implementation of an electronic device is not always achieved. Some batteries contain chemicals that are not considered safe or environmentally friendly (“green”). This makes disposal a potential issue.
 
mPhase is challenging this convention by using their proprietary superhydrophobic porous silicon membrane technology as the basis to build the Smart NanoBattery, a reserve battery providing Power On Command™ prior to initial activation.
 
Superhydrophobicity initially keeps the liquid electrolyte physically separated from the solid electrodes of the battery, thus preventing the chemical reactions from occurring that cause the battery to provide power. This gives the Smart NanoBattery the benefit of potentially infinite shelf life.
 
A conventional battery loses some capacity while sitting on the shelf in its package or stored in an electronic or electrical device, even before being used for the first time. On the other hand, the Smart NanoBattery is built so that it is inactive and remains that way indefinitely until it is turned on. No power is lost to self-discharge or leakage current prior to activation. When needed, the Smart NanoBattery can be activated on command via the phenomenon of electrowetting. The surface properties of the porous silicon membrane are selectively controlled to shift instantly from a superhydrophobic to hydrophilic state. In other words, electrowetting acts as the triggering mechanism.
 
mPhase has successfully fabricated and demonstrated its first 3-volt lithium-based Smart NanoBattery, based on a design allowing either manual or remote activation by the user, the feature known as Power on Command™.
 
By incorporating the phenomenon of electrowetting on nanostructured surfaces into a revolutionary way of storing energy, the Smart NanoBattery provides power to portable electronic and microelectronic devices exactly when and where it is needed. As a reserve batteru it is an augmentation to conventional primary batteries. The nanobattery converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy, but in a way that is potentially more reliable, more versatile, more environmentally friendly, and less expensive than conventional primary batteries.
 
Applications
 
mPhase is exploring military and commercial applications of smart surfaces in which the properties can be accurately and precisely controlled down to the nanometer scale. Electrowetting allows the switching from a hydrophobic to hydrophilic state as a result of an electronic stimulus.
 
The Smart NanoBattery, mPhase’s first smart surface product, has a unique architecture that enables a shelf life of decades, remote activation, programmable control, scalable manufacturing, and adaptability to multiple configurations. The value proposition to the end user is to have a source of energy or power that is literally always ready - reliable, convenient, low cost - a battery guaranteed to work at full capacity when and where you need it.
 
The Smart NanoBattery can conceivably supply power “on command” to a wide variety of portable electronic and microelectronic devices used in military, medical, industrial, and consumer applications.
 
mPhase has demonstrated that the battery works in lab tests as well as in a significant field test conducted for the U.S. Army as part of a guided munitions project. The relationship with the Army also included an $850,000 funded project to develop a battery for a mission critical computer memory backup application. The target was a small footprint, 3-volt lithium battery with a minimum shelf life of 20 years and uninterruptible power output during this time period. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, no other battery technology available today can deliver the long-term performance requirements specified by the U.S. Army for this application.
 
The Smart NanoBattery can potentially be designed to accommodate a variety of sophisticated portable electronic and microelectronic devices including next-generation cell phones, handheld gaming devices, wireless sensor systems, radio frequency identification tags, high-tech flashlights and beacons, health alert alarms, and non-implantable and implantable medical devices such as pacemakers.
 
Initial applications will address the need to supply emergency and backup power to a range of products for defense and security, with future applications in the commercial and consumer arenas.

Strategic Alliances
 
The Company continues togerther with Picatinny Arsenal, to jointly seek federal funding under SBIR grants to develop additional new products for military small munitions applications. The Company has a strong historic cooperative relationship for product development and testing. The Company continues to seek opportunities with various potential academic partners to obtain further STTR grants for new product research and development.
 
In 2007 the Company entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with Picatinny Arsenal to test the single cell version of the Smart NanoBattery suitable for future research and development programs for projectile launched munitions. From 2007 through the first quarter of calendar year 2010, numerous internal laboratory air gun simulation tests were performed, including a live-air gun and live gun fired test at the United States Army’s facility at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland. A prototype of the Smart NanoBattery was the subject of a live fire test as part of a projectile fired out of an Abrams Tank. The results of the test indicated that the battery was activated by 10,000 G forces indicating that it could supply energy necessary to operate a guidance system for small munitions. In addition, the Smart NanoBattery demonstrated extreme resiliency to shock and acceleration since, it survived tests that subjected it to high acceleration of over 30,000 G forces.
 
On February 9, 2011, the Company announced that it had signed a 3-year CRADA with the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny, New Jersey, to continue to cooperatively test and evaluate the mPhase Smart NanoBattery, including new design features functionally appropriate for DoD based systems requiring portable power sources. The army researchers are evaluating the prototypes using the Army’s testing facilities at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey to determine applicability of the technology to gun fired munitions and potentially to incorporate the technologies into research and development and other programs sponsored by Picatinny. The Research Agreement is supported by the Fuze & Precision Armaments Technology Directorate. In order for significant further research and development to be performed with respect to the Smart Nano Battery the Company will have to be successful in obtaining additional congressional funding specifically designated for this type of battery. This CRADA was renewed on March 27, 2014 for an additional three-year period by the Army. The Company is currently seeking to enter a new CRADA with the U.S. Army, subject to availability of funding.

Products& Services
 
Since its inception in 1996, mPhase has been company focused on the development of intellectual property involving high technology innovative solutions and products with high-growth potential. The Company has served as an incubator for exploratory research and initial development for products that are best characterized as having a high risk/high reward profile since they involve exploratory research to achieve significant scientific breakthroughs from existing products that can have a substantial economic impact and benefit upon successful commercialization.
 
Smart NanoBattery
 
The Smart NanoBattery is an outgrowth of the science of nanotechnology that the Company began in February of 2004 with the entry into a Project Development Agreement with the Bell Labs Division of Lucent Technologies, Inc. The Company has historically outsourced its Research and Development of new products to larger companies or institutions with significant scientific resources and experience in exploratory research. mPhase Technologies along with Alcatel/Lucent/Bell Labs jointly conducted research from February 2004 through April of 2007 that demonstrated control and manipulation of fluids on superhydrophobic surfaces to create power cells by controlling wetting behavior of electrolytes on nano structured electrode surfaces. This scientific research set the ground work for continued exploration in the development of intelligent nanotechnology power cells (nano-batteries) and formed a path to commercialization of the technology for a broad range of market opportunities. During 2005 and 2006, the battery team tested modifications and enhancements to the internal design of the battery to optimize its power and energy density characteristics, as well as engineering improvements that were essential in moving the battery from a zinc based chemistry to a design using lithium based chemistry The Company established a strategic research working relationship with the Energy Storage Research Group (ESRG), a center of excellence in Rutgers University that has lab research facilities capable of handling lithium based battery development.
 
mPhase’s current flagship product is its Smart NanoBattery that has a significantly longer shelf life prior to initial activation than that of conventional batteries. The Smart NanoBattery has potentially significant applications for critical mission power sources that must be reliable and available upon command by the electronic device it is powering. Such applications involve emergency flashlights and beacons, back-up power sources for computers and life support products, as well as significant military applications where critical mission backup power is essential for weapons control computers and electronic warfare equipment used in combat. Other potential military applications include power sources activated by g-forces for guided munitions.
 
The Smart NanoBattery utilizes a proprietary technology developed over a period of 11 years. The battery design, prior to initial activation, has a membrane that separates the electrolyte and electrodes used to generate power. Conventional batteries do not provide for such separation and therefore their power begins to dissipate prior to the first time they are activated causing them to lose capacity. Conventional batteries have significant limits on how long they can be stored prior to their first activation and in providing a reliable source of power needed for critical applications requiring portable power supplies.

Competitive Business Conditions
 
Battery Segment
 
The Company believes that the design and functionality of the mPhase lithium Smart NanoBattery make it unique to the portable electronics battery market segment. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing product that directly competes with the Smart NanoBattery in terms of its combination of small size and reserve design. As a reserve battery, the Smart NanoBattery remains dormant until it is activated on command. It does not self-discharge or die prior to its first activation, thereby offering extremely long shelf life prior to use as either a primary or backup battery in a device. Shelf life is projected to be in excess of twenty years.
 
There are numerous thin film batteries based on lithium metal, lithium ion and lithium polymer, as well as other chemistries, used in military devices, portable electronics, RFID tags and wireless sensor networks, that are similar in size to the Smart NanoBattery, often referred to as microbatteries. None of these designs is based on reserve battery architectures. Thin film batteries are manufactured by companies including Cymbet Corporation, Front Edge Technology, Infinite Power Solutions, ITN Energy Systems, Johnson Research and Development Company, KSW Microtec, Lithium Technology Corporation, MPower Solutions, Oak Ridge Micro-Energy, Power Paper, Solicore, VoltaFlex Corporation. Large companies such as Energizer, Ultralife, Varta and Proctor & Gamble are also involved with developing thin film batteries. Thin film battery markets are anticipated to grow substantially as the result of a wide expansion of portable devices in that time frame. With 3.5 billion cell phone users and 67 billion RFID tags per year anticipated during year 2012, it is expected that there will be substantial commercial demand for thin film batteries.
 
Traditional reserve batteries are distinct from the mPhase Smart NanoBattery in terms of size and activation mechanism. The market for reserve batteries has largely been limited to the military for supplying power to munitions and other mission-critical electronic devices. The traditional reserve battery tends to be larger and certain types are built by hand and contain mechanical parts to activate the battery. The Smart NanoBattery relies on the phenomenon of electrowetting to initiate activation or a mechanical barrier that can be broken, in the case of the breakable barrier design. Traditional reserve batteries for military applications have been supplied by companies such as EaglePicher, Yardney and Storage Battery Systems, Inc. The Company believes that it may be able to significantly reduce the cost of its Smart Nanobattery with the recent discovery of the potential of “printing” the battery on a form of graphite rather than traditional silicon surface. The Company, through its working relationship with Stevens Institute, began in fiscal year 2012 to investigate the feasibility of the use of graphite which is much stronger, flexible and inexpensive than traditional silicon.
 
Outsourcing
 
Research and Development
 
The Company practices an outsourcing model whereby it contracts with third party vendors to perform research and development rather than performing the bulk of these functions internally. For current development of its SmartNano battery, the Company has outsourced the majority of the work. From February of 2004 through March of 2007, the Company engaged Lucent/Bell Labs (now Nokia) to develop, using the science of nanotechnology, micro power cell arrays creating a structure for zinc batteries that separated the chemicals or electrolytes prior to initial activation. This was done by suspending on nano grass or small spoke-like pieces of silicon a liquid electrolyte taking advantage of a superhydrophobic effect that occurs as a result of the ability to manipulate materials of a very small size or less than 1/50,000 the size of a human hair. The Company has, as a result of outsourcing, been able to have access to facilities, equipment and research capabilities that the Company would not be able to develop on its own given the financial resources and time that would be required to build or acquire such research capabilities. The Company has also been able to achieve key strategic alliances with the U.S. Army to successfully test, under military combat conditions, its SmartBattery design, leading to further validation of its path to product development under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). In addition, the Company has formed a relationship with Energy Storage Research Group, a center of excellence at Rutgers University, in New Jersey, that has enabled the Company to expand its battery development from a zinc to a lithium battery capable of delivering significantly more power. During fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the Company outsourced considerable foundry work for final development of the Smart NanoBattery to Silex, a Swedish company.
 
During the period from March of 2005 to April of 2007, the Company engaged the Bell Labs division of Lucent Technologies, Inc. to develop a magnetometer or electronic sensor also using the science of nanotechnology. Although the Company has, in order to conserve financial resources, currently suspended further development of its magnetometer product line, we believe that the intellectual property developed from the research to date could be resumed to develop viable military and industrial products depending upon future financial resources of the Company and future competitive market conditions.
 
Commencing in fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the Company has not engaged in any further outsourcing for product development of its Smart NanoBattery in order to conserve resources. During fiscal year 2014 the Company began purchasing a cost reduced version of a battery jump starter products. Such purchasing increased significantly in fiscal year 2015 as a result of the roll-out of the mPower Jump products.

Research and Development
 
From March of 2005 through March of 2007, the Company had engaged Bell Labs under separate Development Agreements for the development of a new generation of ultra-magnetic sensors (magnetometers) using the science of nanotechnology with a total cost of $2.4 million. The Company did not renew such its engagement with Bell Labs upon expiration and did not incur any further costs with respect to its magnetometer since the Company has discontinued further development of the product to conserve financial resources. 
 
Our Smart NanoBattery and power cell technology research and development was performed by the Bell Labs division of Alcatel/Lucent from February of 2004 through March of 2007 at an aggregate cost of $3.8 million. The Company paid Bell Labs $300,000 covering the period from April 27, 2007 through July 30, 2007, at which time it determined that, in order to develop a lithium battery for higher density energy than zinc, it required facilities capable of handling lithium battery research that Bell Labs does not have. The Company engaged a number of small foundries during fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 for commercialization of its Smart NanoBattery at a cost of approximately $150,000. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company engaged Eagle Picher at a cost of $75,000 to design and engineer a prototype of its manually-activated lithium reserve battery and Porsche Design studio at a cost of $79,123 for design of its emergency flashlight product. In addition, the Company secured a Co-Branding Agreement with Porsche Design Studio for its emergency flashlight product. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the Company paid $950,018 in connection with producing and bringing this product to market, and in fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company incurred $33,254 of expenses in connection with this product. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company engaged Silex, a silicon foundry in Sweden, at a cost of $21,200 for further development of its Smart NanoBattery; payments to Silex for fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 in connection with the Smart NanoBattery amounted to $396,780, and for fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 they were $40,800.
