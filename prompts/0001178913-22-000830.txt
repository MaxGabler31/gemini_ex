Overview
 
Our mission is to power any video experience, for any organization. Our Video Experience Cloud powers live, real-time, and on-demand video for webinars, events, virtual classrooms, and video sites. We also offer robust Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") and Software Development Kits ("SDKs") for developers and industry solutions for education and media and telecom. Our Video Experience Cloud is used by leading brands across all industries, reaching millions of users, at home, at school and at work, for communication, collaboration, marketing, sales, customer care, learning, and entertainment experiences. With our flexible offerings, customers can experience the benefits of video across a wide range of use cases, while customizing their deployments to meet their individual, dynamic needs.
 
Video is everywhere. It has become a driving force for online interactions and engagement, and has revolutionized how we communicate, work, learn, and entertain. For businesses, video sits at the heart of digital transformation, with organizations increasingly embracing video solutions to better engage with customers and employees. Video adoption has been further fueled by the availability of broadband, increased penetration of smartphones, rise of over-the-top streaming (“OTT”) and cloud technologies, consumerization of enterprise technology, elevation of video to strategic and mission-critical use cases, the entry of younger professionals into the workforce and the growth in remote and distributed workforces. Furthermore, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use and adoption of video.
 
Our vision and technology are differentiated in the market, addressing video as a unique data type that can and should be handled by a unified horizontal technology stack that powers all live, real-time, and on-demand video use cases, maximizing engagement, interactivity and the collection of data. Our Video Experience Cloud powers a wide array of video applications across industries and use cases. Our core offerings consist of various Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) products and solutions and a Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) offering, including:
 

• | Video Products – Video Sites, Webinars, Virtual Classroom, and Events. Customers leverage these products for video-based communication, collaboration, training, and customer experience (marketing, sales, and customer care). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Video Industry Solutions – LMS Video (Learning Management System) and Lecture Capture for educational institutions to support and enhance in-class and remote teaching and learning. We also offer a TV Solution for media companies and telecom operators, allowing them to provide OTT advertising and subscription-based live and on-demand TV services for entertainment experiences. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Media Services – Live, real-time, and on-demand video APIs, SDKs, and Experience Components as well as Video and TV Content Management Systems that govern the entire lifecycle of video, enabling customers to build any video experience and workflow. Our Media Services also serve as a foundation for our products and industry solutions. Our APIs and SDKs address: media ingestion, creation, editing, files transcoding, live transcoding, real-time video, publishing, streaming, distribution, recording and scheduling, video enrichment, search, management, monitoring, engagement, video and image transformation, access control, user management, analytics, multi-tenancy, security, digital rights management, and media repurposing at scale. Our Experience Components include video player, video editor, video accessibility tools, video capture tools, large files upload SDKs, interactive video editor, quizzing, hot-spots, polling, native mobile and TV SDKs, video applications framework, embedded live stream app, and embedded WebRTC meeting components.

As of December 31, 2021, we had over 1,000 customers from a wide range of industries, including financial services, high technology, healthcare, education, public sector, media and telecommunications. Among our customers are 28 of the US Fortune 100, more than 50% of U.S. R1 educational institutions, including seven of the eight Ivy League schools and some of the largest global media companies and telecom operators. This subset of customers accounted for approximately 39% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Most of our top customers leverage several Kaltura products for a range of use cases across their organization. Between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2021, we expanded our base of customers with ARR greater than $100,000 from 178 to 294, and the number of customers with ARR greater than $1.0 million from 4 to 21.
 
In 2021, we were recognized as a Visionary in the 2021 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™, and we ranked 4th in the ‘External Presentation’ (4.44/5) Use Case, and 5th in the ‘Learning and Training’ (4.32/5), and ‘Webinars’ (4.16/5) Use Cases in the Gartner 2021 Critical Capabilities for Meeting Solutions Report. We were also recognized as a Representative Vendor in the 2020 Gartner Market Guide for Enterprise Video Content Management. We have been included in Gartner research reports on this since 2013, where we were listed as a Leader for 5 consecutive times in the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Video Content Management report and ranked highest in all Use Cases in the last-published Critical Capabilities for Enterprise Video Content Management report. Gartner discontinued publication of this Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Video Content Management report in 2018 and of the correlating Critical Capabilities report in 2019.
 
We have also received customer recognition. As of January 19, 2022, we ranked 4.6/5 out of 57 reviews for Meeting Solutions and 4.6/5 out of 28 reviews for Enterprise Video Content Management by customers on Gartner Peer Insights.
 
In March 2021, we were also cited as a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave™: B2B Marketing Events Management Solutions, Q1 2021.
 
To date, we have invested primarily in increasing the scope and depth of our offerings. At the same time, we have accelerated our year-over-year revenue growth from 12% in 2018 to 18% in 2019, 24% in 2020 and 37% in 2021. We accomplished this growth without materially increasing our sales and marketing spend over 2019 and 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began investing significantly in sales and marketing expenses to drive revenue growth, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated net losses of $59.4 million and had Adjusted EBITDA of $(12.2) million. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure.
 
Our platform provides a differentiated and comprehensive value proposition for our customers. Additionally, we believe the demand for video offerings has reached an inflection point, with several trends driving strong demand for video applications. We intend to continue expanding our Video Experience Cloud with new Media Services, as well as new products and industry solutions. We have also begun to increase our sales and marketing investment to capture the significant market opportunity ahead of us, including increasing the size and reach of our direct sales team, and investing in self-serve products and channel partnerships to expand our presence with smaller customers across all industries.
 



Key Trends Impacting the Video Market
 
The nature of video consumption has transformed in recent years. Several major trends have played a role in this evolution:
 

• | Availability of Broadband: The availability of internet-based services has increased in recent years, with global telecom operators increasing investment in next-generation mobile networks to reach previously underpenetrated regions and enhance performance in existing ones. This, coupled with the decreasing price of broadband, has accelerated the use of internet-based services such as video across a global audience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Penetration of Smartphones: Billions of people around the world use smartphones today, equipped with sophisticated technology that allows them to create, watch, and transmit video anytime and anywhere. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rise of OTT and Cloud Technologies: Television has left its original home within cable and satellite networks and TV set-top boxes and is now being delivered from the cloud as an internet-based service to any device. OTT video technology has enabled content providers to bypass the traditional distribution value chain and reach consumers directly without relying on network owners as the middleman. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumerization of Enterprise Technology: Employees in today’s businesses expect consumer-like experiences with enterprise technology, expanding their use case of technology at work from simply exchanging information and data, to interacting, socializing, and learning. This has accelerated the use of video for both internal and external use cases. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Shift to Remote Work and Education: The world is shifting to a new normal that includes remote and hybrid work practices that rely heavily on video communication, including virtual meetings and asynchronous communications, each of which require complex, integrated video workflows and analytics, to create comprehensive digital experiences at scale. Additionally, as entire campuses have shifted online, video and virtual classrooms have become a requirement for business continuity and operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Virtual Events: Over the past two years, COVID-19 has forced conference and event organizers to adopt a virtual experience. Such events have proven their ROI in marketing funnels and employee engagement, enabling a scale of events and digital touchpoints with a lower budget. At the core of these events is video – for communication, content, education and more. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COVID-19 Pandemic Accelerating Preexisting Trends: We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of video for numerous use cases, including remote learning, remote work, remote healthcare, consumer communication, e-commerce and online entertainment. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated preexisting trends, with video experiences poised to be a key element of online interactions for decades to come. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of Existing Video Solutions
 
While various video solutions exist in the market today, we believe they are mostly discrete inflexible point solutions that suffer from a lack of modularity, extensibility, and interoperability; offer limited breadth and depth of functionality, data insights, and end user engagement; and do not provide the required cloud-based enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, compliance, and security. As a result, these offerings limit the ability of customers to maximize the benefits of video technology for their businesses and are also too costly and require significant time to value.

• | Discrete Point Solutions: Most existing solution providers lack workflows and experiences connecting different video technologies (live, real-time and on-demand), devices, and use cases. As a result, businesses are faced with the complexity of working with multiple vendors to meet their video needs, often leading to a lack of cohesiveness across offerings, silos of content and disjointed workflows, and security and monitoring concerns. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inflexible Offerings: Many existing video solutions are turnkey applications that provide little by way of integration and customization. Their inflexible architecture often inhibits existing vendors’ ability to innovate quickly and extend the offering to keep up with the rapidly growing and evolving needs for video. Additionally, existing vendors provide few tools for businesses to build their own advanced video workflows and products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited Integration with Ecosystem: Most existing video solution providers have only a few integrations with third-party platforms, and therefore offer limited interoperability and a disjointed end-user experience. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited Analytics Capabilities: Existing solutions often lack the robust analytics tools that enable interactivity and personalization. This limits the ability of businesses to make data-driven business decisions, further translating to limited end user engagement and a lower return on investment. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not Optimized for End Users: The interfaces of existing solutions are often not intuitive, and do not generate an immersive and engaging end user experience across devices. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not Built for the Cloud: Many existing offerings are not cloud-native and instead rely on legacy on-premise deployments to deliver their solutions, limiting their ability to innovate quickly and provide video seamlessly across devices. This also creates operational complexities for customers managing multiple video solutions and limits their ability to leverage economies of scale. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Insufficient Support of Enterprise Standards: Many existing offerings lack the scale, security, and compliance needed by today’s enterprises, and also lack the development, contribution, and support for industry standards that promote openness, interoperability, and accessibility. This creates a growing risk for businesses that are using video for mission-critical use cases at scale. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unnecessary Costs: Existing solutions frequently require extensive implementation, hardware maintenance and custom integrations with other video solutions and adjacent tools, often resulting in excess costs for the customer. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kaltura’s Video Experience Cloud
 
Our Video Experience Cloud powers all types of video experiences: live, real-time, and on-demand. We designed it from the ground up using API-based building blocks that govern the entire video lifecycle and provide the foundation for our video applications. We believe our Video Experience Cloud is differentiated by the following characteristics:

• | Unified Experiences: Our native support for video solutions across the tech stack – live, real-time, and on-demand, enables us to create unified experiences that bridge technologies to create simple, cohesive workflows. This enables us to not only simplify operations, but also create new video experiences and richer content, avoiding the content and data silos generated by having several fragmented and disjointed point solutions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interactive Media Experiences: We provide the complete stack, from video creation tools to playback. By providing tools for creators, we can create more immersive playback experiences, with interactive options for viewers. Live experiences such as webinars and meetings can be translated to interactive on-demand videos, providing not only a better experience for each viewer, but also a longer shelf life for content created. With content-centric experiences, we create engagement around the content, powering learning and collaboration. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Media Services and Extensive Developer Tools: We offer developers extensive APIs, SDKs and media capabilities, enabling them to bring video experiences to any application. With embeddable experience components, application developers can shorten time to market, while bringing a complete and mature experience to their users. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ecosystem: We have built a rich ecosystem of over 125 technology partners, extending our experiences with AI, video creation, and network optimization, among others. We make our partners’ solutions available to our customers through our marketplace, complete with a variety of plugins and out-of-the-box integrations with our platform. This ecosystem further simplifies our customers’ workflows, enabling them to weave video capabilities into non-video workflows and discover new technologies to further enhance their own offerings, ultimately increasing their satisfaction and stickiness with our platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analytics: Our platform offers powerful analytics across multiple dimensions, including insights related to engagement, time and seasonality comparisons, bottleneck identification, and congestion detection. These features help companies maximize the use of the data they are gathering across video channels, and better guide workflows associated with subscription. They also enable us to generate a significant amount of valuable data, which, when coupled with our proprietary AI/ML-powered analytics capabilities, drives further usage of our platform, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cloud-Agnostic: While most of our customers use our public cloud products and solutions, our solutions can be deployed across any private, public, or hybrid cloud environment, as well as on-premise, providing our customers with complete flexibility around their deployment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise-Grade: Our platform offers enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability, allowing us to support mission-critical workflows for experiences of any scale. We also offer proactive monitoring and various tiers of customer support. For customers that rely on Kaltura to power TV experiences, we offer service availability commitments of up to 99.995%, the highest industry benchmark required by major media and telecom customers. Additionally, we are a leader in the market with the development, contribution, and support for industry standards such as MPEG-DASH, LTI, Caliper and Open Video Capture standards by IMS Global Learning Consortium. We maintain compliance with accessibility standards, such as 508, CVAA, and WCAG 2.0 AA, and issued a self-disclosing Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (“VPAT”) to ensure we adhere to the highest standards.

Growth Strategies
 
We intend to drive significant growth by executing on the following key strategies:
 

• | Acquire New Customers: We believe we have a significant opportunity to expand our presence with Fortune Global 2000 companies and other global enterprises. We are in the process of increasing our investment in sales and marketing to capitalize on our significant market opportunity and on the strong sales efficiency unit economics that we have demonstrated. We are growing our base of field sales representatives and customer success managers, which we believe will drive both geographic and vertical expansion. Additionally, we are investing for the first time in inside sales, self-serve offerings, and distribution channels. We believe this will enable us to expand our presence across all industries – beyond enterprises into SMEs, beyond universities into K-12 schools, beyond tier 1 media and telecom companies to tier 2 and 3 media and telecom companies, and beyond providing Media Services to large technology companies to also addressing smaller technology firms and startups.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Augment our Platform Offering through Partnerships and Opportunistic M&A: We plan to increase the breadth of partnerships with our technology partners, further allowing us to provide the most comprehensive video solutions to our customers. Additionally, we intend to continue to explore potential transactions that could enhance our capabilities or increase the scope of our technology footprint.

Our sales organization is primarily comprised of direct sales and account teams that focus mainly on acquisition, retention, and growth of large customers, including Fortune Global 2000 organizations. We currently have four direct sales and account teams, as noted below. Each of our teams sells the following offerings:

• | M&T team, which sells our Media Services and TV Solution to media and telecom companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Education team, which sells our Media Services, Video Products and specialized education industry solutions to universities and K-12 institutions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology team, which sells our Media Services and Video Products to technology companies who want to integrate our offerings into their own video workflows and products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “All Other Enterprises” team, which sells our Media Services and Video Products to all other customers (as well as sells our Video Products to our M&T customers). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, we leverage reseller relationships globally to help market and sell our products to customers worldwide, especially in areas in which we have a limited presence.
 
We are investing in initiatives to more efficiently reach new customers and expand our partnerships with existing ones. For example, we recently launched the option to purchase our Webinars, Virtual Classroom, and Media Services offerings directly from our website, allowing us to reduce our cost of customer acquisition, drive additional opportunities to our direct sales team, reach smaller customers, and broaden our target market.
 
Our marketing efforts are focused on creating preference for our brand, and driving leads to Kaltura through thought leadership, participation in industry events, analyst and press coverage, customer referrals, community work, customer user groups, and Kaltura produced customer and industry events like “Kaltura Connect” and “Kaltura Virtually Live”. We also leverage digital campaigns and make free trials available for many of our products to drive engagement and conversion.
 



Research & Development
 
Our business has been driven by constant innovation, anticipating trends ahead of other participants in the market. We believe we are one of the first organizations to recognize the importance and mission-critical nature of video experiences, and the subsequent need for Media Services that allow both us and our customers to support any video experience and workflow. Our ability to be a leader in our target markets and rapidly introduce new applications depends on the constant expansion of our Media Services, and the development of new products and industry solutions that rely on them.
 
We work closely with our customers to address their growing needs for video experiences across all areas of operation. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of video experiences and have released over 100 new and enhanced features a year, on average for the last several years.
 
Our main research and development facility is located near Tel Aviv, Israel, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to leverage a talented pool of engineers and product experts.
 
Technology & Operations
 
We believe our unique specialized Video Experience Cloud and technology enable a high level of reliability, scalability, performance, and security. Our cloud platform was specifically designed to address the entire lifecycle of video, addressing the need for intense computing resources for encoding, processing, synchronization, and delivery, as well as a higher level of bandwidth and network utilization and performance. We have addressed this in our platform design and development from the start. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are deployed on AWS across several regions, including in Virginia, Oregon, Canada, Ireland, Frankfurt, Singapore, and Australia. In each region we are deployed on several availability zones for improved availability and resilience. We are also in the process of deploying our platform on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which we believe will further enhance the resilience, reach and scale of our operations.
 
Our technology and platform are cloud agnostic, allowing us to also offer private cloud, on-premise, and hybrid deployment options. While the great majority of our customers are deployed on our AWS public cloud infrastructure, some customers are hosted on separate and dedicated AWS private cloud environments that are also managed by us. Some customers have a hybrid cloud deployment, running our platform from the public cloud alongside a locally hosted Kaltura Enterprise CDN service or with locally hosted content storage. We also cater to self-hosted on-premise customers that deploy the same Kaltura Video Experience Cloud fully on their own infrastructure, and manage it for themselves.
 
Our cloud operation teams are responsible for maintaining and upgrading our production environments, and for our system availability service-level agreements which vary from 99.9% to 99.995% (depending on the service).
 
Our customer care teams are located around the world and operate on a “follow-the-sun” model, providing 24/7 service and ensuring that issues with our products and platform are addressed quickly, and according to our service level agreements.
 
Our Video Operations Center (“VOC”) is responsible for monitoring our applications and services 24/7, responding to system alerts, and managing incidents.
 


Partner Ecosystem
 
We have built an ecosystem consisting of over 125 partners that have integrated with our solutions, and extend our products and platform capabilities with creation, AI, transcripts, and delivery capabilities. We make our partners’ solutions available to our customers through our marketplace, complete with a variety of plugins and out-of-the-box integrations with our platform. This ecosystem further simplifies our customers’ workflows, enabling them to weave video capabilities into non-video workflows and discover new technologies to further enhance their own offerings, ultimately increasing their satisfaction and stickiness with our platform. It also allows us to test new experiences and components with our customers and determine which of the partnerships or technologies are strategic to our business.
 
We also leverage a network of value-add resellers that add additional services or integrations to our products, helping us drive the acquisition of new customers around the world, notably those in regions in which we do not have significant presence.
 
We also maintain relationships with cloud partners, most notably Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). We are an AWS Technology Partner and certified as an AWS competency partner in Education and Digital Workspace, with validated qualifications in Public Sector. As a member of the AWS ISV Accelerate Program, we are able to co-sell with the AWS sales organization to accelerate sales cycles and drive new business. Additionally, our offerings are available in the AWS marketplace.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 758 employees operating across 34 countries on 5 continents.
 
We aim to provide our employees with a competitive salary and benefits that will enable them to achieve a good quality of life and plan for the future. In addition to competitive base salaries and cash compensation, we maintain equity incentive plans to attract, retain and reward personnel through share-based compensation awards.
 
We are committed to ensuring a culture of diversity and equality. Our culture embraces our employees’ differences in age, race, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation and nationality.
 
Except for certain of our employees in Brazil, our employees are not represented by a labor union in respect to their employment or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
 We have not experienced any work stoppages and largely consider our relationship with our employees to be good and mutually beneficial.
 
Competition
 
We believe our technology positions us well to compete with other video solution providers. Our key competitors vary based on market and industry.
 

• | Our main competitors for Media Services (including Kaltura Video Content Management System) are Microsoft/Azure Media Services, Amazon/AWS Media Services, and Twilio 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitors for Video Sites are Microsoft and Vimeo
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitors for Webinars are Zoom and Cisco
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitors for Events are Cvent, Intrado and Hopin
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitor for Virtual Classroom is Adobe Connect
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitors for our Education Solutions (Kaltura LMS Video and Lecture Capture) are Zoom, Microsoft, and Cisco 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our main competitors for our Media & Telecom Solution are Synamedia (formerly under Cisco), MediaKind (formerly under Ericsson), and Comcast Technology Solutions (part of Comcast) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include, but are not limited to:
 

• | breadth and scale of products, solutions, and Media Services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to provide a cross-organization video platform with multiple interoperable video solutions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to support converging experiences across live, real time, and on-demand video;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | flexibility to build and support custom workflows using video technology;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of customization and integration with other products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | quality of service and customer satisfaction;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | flexibility of deployment options;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ability to innovate quickly;
--+-----------------------------


• | data capabilities, including advanced analytics and AI;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | cost of implementation and ongoing use;
--+----------------------------------------


• | brand recognition; and
--+-----------------------


• | corporate culture.
--+-------------------

 
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources; relationships with large vendor partners; larger global presence; larger customer bases; longer operating histories; greater brand recognition; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Furthermore, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The markets in which we compete are nascent and highly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, some of whom have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.”
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business and we seek protection for our intellectual property rights as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, know-how and continuing innovation, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and intellectual property assignment agreements.
 



As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine issued U.S. patents and eleven non-U.S. patents and patent applications. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2035.
 
We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark registrations in the United States and in some other jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, we owned five registered trademarks in the United States and three registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and Brazil, that we consider material to the marketing of our products, including the “Kaltura” name and logo.
 
We generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and consultants and to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. However, we cannot guarantee that all applicable parties have executed such agreements. Such agreements can also be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach.
 
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform and many of our products and services incorporate software components licensed to the general public under open-source software licenses. We obtain some components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open-source components of our platform. Open-source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute certain components of our platform. As a result, open-source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our proprietary software assets.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and services with the same functionality as our platform. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies like ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products and services incorporating those technologies. For more information regarding the risks relating to intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Data Privacy and Security.”
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, we have experienced seasonality in bookings and collections from customers within the education market, with a pattern of higher sales and new academic customers in the second and third quarters of the year as a result of school procurement periods, resulting in lower sequential sales and customer growth in other quarters of the year. We also experience increased usage by these customers during periods when school is in session, leading to higher cost of revenue during the first and fourth quarters of the year. Because the agreements for certain of our solutions do not limit usage or increase pricing for usage in excess of a specified amount, these additional costs may not result in a corresponding increase in revenue.
 
The rapid growth we have experienced in recent years may have masked the full effects of these seasonal factors on our business to date, and as such, these factors may have a greater effect on our results of operations in future periods.
