Current Business
 
Effective December 28, 2016 Addentax Group Corp. (“ATXG” or the “Company”) has executed a Sale & Purchase Agreement (“S&P”) for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles. Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd.(“YICG”) is currently a garment manufacturer. Intending to diversify its service portfolio, the Company plans to develop its another branch of business: international supply chain management consulting service, which focuses exclusively on the textile & garments industry. The Company plans to assist clients to open textile and garment sales outlets throughout China. The company will also provide assistance services in plan implementation. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue five hundred million (500,000,000) restricted common shares of the company to the owners of Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd.
 
After the Share Exchange, YICG’s business became our business. We are a garment manufacturer and logistic service provider based in China. We are listed on the OTCQB under the symbol of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into two segments: Garment manufacturing and logistics services.
 
Our garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesaler located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We have our own manufacturing facilities, with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards and timely delivery requirement for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”) and Shantou Chenghai Dai Tou Garments Co., Ltd (“DT”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
 
Our logistic business consists of delivery and courier services covering approximately 20 provinces in China. Although we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd (“XKJ”) and Shenzhen Hua Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“HPF”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.

Business Objectives
 
Garment Manufacturing Business
 
We believe the enduring strength of our garment manufacturing business is mainly due to our consistent emphasis on exceptional quality and timely delivery. The primary business objective for our garment manufacturing segment is to expand our customer base and improve our profit. In the future, we plan to develop our growth opportunities and continued investment initiatives to provide value-added consulting services to the apparel supply-chain companies and retailers in China.
Logistic Business
 
The business objective and future plan for our logistic service segment is to establish an efficient logistic system and to build a nationwide delivery and courier network in China. As of December 31, 2017, we provide logistic service to over 23 cities in approximately 20 provinces. We expect to increase the efficiency of existing logistics points and improve the net income year end of 2018.
Seasonality of Business
 
Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of garment sales in our second and third quarters and higher logistic service revenue in our third and fourth quarters. These trends primarily result from the timing of seasonal garment manufacturing shipments and holiday periods in the logistic segment.
 
Garment manufacturing business
 
For our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by advances or deposits. For our long-term and established customers with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following the delivery of finished goods.
 
Logistic business
 
For logistic service, we generally receive payments from the customers between 30 to 90 days following the date of the register receipt of packages.
 
Future Business
 
In addition to our garment manufacturing business, we also want to kick start our supply chain management consulting service. Our supply chain management consulting service is still under development with no active clients. However, due to the uniqueness of our business model, we have attracted over 30 potential clients strongly interested in our proposed service. All those potential clients are located in China. We plan to put our proposed service into operation in second or third quarter of 2018.
 
To guarantee the quality of our business, we set strict rules for our potential clients and see their qualification.

3. | Have not breached any law or regulation, or have received any administrative penalty from a regulatory body or other department in the past twenty-four months; 

 
Our industry chain service refers to companies meeting the requirement for development and inclusion as a supply chain outlet. Medium and small-sized enterprises all over the world can search for our service, but our current focus is on helping clients in China.
 
Many medium-small sized enterprises in China experience the problem of business maintenance or expansion in the textile and garments industry where increasing operational costs cause decreasing profit. Most seek to employ new business models that can increase a company’s competitive advantage and bring a powerful sales engine to the company. With possible limitation of resources and information, management of these enterprises find it hard to design a suitable plan for their company’s sustainable development.
