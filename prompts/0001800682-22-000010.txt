Item 1. Business 
Overview
We are a primary care-centric, technology-powered healthcare delivery and population health management platform designed with a focus on clinical excellence. Our mission is simple: to improve patient health by delivering superior primary care medical services while forging life-long bonds with our members. Our vision is clear: to become the national leader in primary care by improving the health, wellness and quality of life of the communities we serve while reducing healthcare costs.
We are one of the largest independent primary care physician groups in the United States. We utilize our technology-powered, value-based care delivery platform to provide care for our members. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 227,005 members across eight states and Puerto Rico, approximately 400 employed providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) and approximately 750 clinical support employees at our 130 owned medical centers, and over 1,000 affiliate providers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics” for how we define our members and medical centers. We predominantly enter into capitated contracts with the nation’s largest health plans to provide holistic, comprehensive healthcare. In 2021, a significant portion of our revenues were from recurring capitated arrangements. We predominantly recognize recurring per member per month capitated revenue, which, in the case of health plans, is a pre-negotiated percentage of the premium that the health plan receives from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"). We also provide practice management and administrative support services to independent physicians and group practices that we do not own through our managed services organization relationships, which we refer to as our affiliate providers. Our contracted recurring revenue model offers us highly predictable revenue and rewards us for providing high-quality care rather than driving a high volume of services. In this capitated arrangement, our goals are well-aligned with payors and patients alike—the more we improve health outcomes, the more profitable we will be over time. CanoPanorama, our proprietary population health management technology-powered platform, is a critical enabler of our efforts to deliver superior clinical care.
We provide access to high-quality care to primarily underserved and dual-eligible (i.e., eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) populations, many of whom live in economically disadvantaged and minority communities, thereby contributing to the revitalization of these communities. We have rapidly expanded to become a nationally-recognized, multi-state provider that is primarily focused on Medicare-eligible beneficiaries where we can have the greatest positive impact on our members and for our payors.
Significant Challenges Facing the Healthcare System Today
The healthcare system in the U.S. today faces many challenges. The U.S. spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country in the world, but its health outcomes are no better and, in many cases, worse than other comparable nations. The current U.S. healthcare model has significant shortcomings, with poor primary care access and experience, a lack of longitudinal engagement and care coordination for patients, poor use of data to effectively drive decision-making and physicians incentivized to provide higher quantities of procedures over quality of care. The U.S. suffers from lower relative spending on primary care, with approximately 6% of U.S. healthcare spending on primary care compared to an average of approximately 14% across the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. The result is inferior health outcomes, with preventive health services used at approximately 55% of the recommended rate, 18 million avoidable visits to U.S. emergency rooms each year, 63% of Medicare Advantage patients and 77% of patients dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid with two or more chronic conditions, and an estimated $850 billion of wasted healthcare spending annually. 
Despite this very actionable opportunity to improve the healthcare ecosystem, the majority of primary care provider groups are not equipped to use their unique positioning to drive better health outcomes. The majority of the primary care provider landscape is made up of solo practitioners, small physician groups and independent practice associations that have limited ability to invest in technology, preventive medicine and population health management strategies to proactively manage risk and improve care coordination.
We Deliver Value-Based Primary Care to the Fastest Growing Market in Healthcare
While seniors have an option to select original fee-for-service Medicare, Medicare beneficiaries also have the option to receive enhanced Medicare benefits through private health plans via Medicare Advantage. In Medicare Advantage, CMS pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating member. This provides the health plans with an incentive to deliver lower-cost, high-quality care. Health plans in turn are incentivized to contract with provider groups that deliver superior patient outcomes and satisfaction levels to their members.
We believe that the traditional fee-for-service model does not optimally incentivize physicians—it incentivizes volume rather than quality, as physicians are paid solely based on the amount of healthcare services they deliver. This leads to less focus on preventive care and care coordination, which often results in inferior long-term health outcomes and ultimately higher healthcare costs for both payors and patients. Value-based care refers to the goal of incentivizing healthcare providers to simultaneously increase quality while lowering the cost of care. Value-based care is viewed by many as a superior payor model, as it aligns the incentives of (i) providers, (ii) payors, and (iii) patients, and drives better care and superior patient experiences. In a value-based care model, providers are able to achieve higher profitability by improving long-term member health outcomes.
As a result, there is a significant shift in Medicare today, from the traditional payment model to value-based care. Medicare Advantage is the fastest growing market in the healthcare industry serving seniors, due in part to an aging population and accelerated healthcare spend. According to the Congressional Budget Office, annual Medicare spending is expected to increase from $830 billion in 2021 to $1,260 billion by 2026. Within Medicare, Medicare Advantage membership is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% to 8%, and penetration of the Medicare beneficiary population is projected to increase from 42% in 2021 to over 50% by 2026. 
The shift toward Medicare Advantage is driven by enhanced plan benefits and the superior cost-efficiency and quality offered relative to original fee-for-service Medicare. Because of increasing evidence that Medicare Advantage delivers better quality and cost outcomes relative to original fee-for-service Medicare, Medicare Advantage has broad bipartisan political support.
While CMS and Medicare Advantage plans seek value-based care providers to deliver care, few providers are able to effectively and efficiently supply this demand. We focus on capitated contracts where we can make the greatest impact. Our value-based model is predominantly driven by contractual arrangements with payors in which we recognize recurring per member per month capitated revenue. These payors include CMS and managed care organizations like Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, CVS (or their respective affiliates) and others contracted by CMS. In return, we are generally responsible for all of the healthcare costs of those members incurred at our primary care locations in addition to all third-party medical expenses (hospital visits, specialist services, surgical services, prescription drug costs, etc.). In this capitated arrangement, our goals are well-aligned with payors and patients—the more we improve health outcomes, the more profitable we will be over time. Ultimately, we aim to keep our members healthy and eliminate waste of healthcare resources while delivering higher quality care with meaningfully differentiated results, all while sustaining very high member loyalty scores.
Well Positioned to Expand Care to Medicare-Eligible Beneficiaries in Underserved Communities
We have over ten years of experience providing care in communities that suffer from poor access to primary care, low quality care and high amounts of unnecessary spending on healthcare. We believe our experience will position us well to expand into similar new markets. Approximately 40% of our Medicare Advantage members are dual-eligible, qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Our value-based care can make the biggest difference when brought into these underserved communities who need it the most. We have been able to serve low-income communities efficiently and are among the only scaled primary care groups making an impact in these communities with a successful track record across multiple markets. 
Many seniors choose Medicare Advantage because it offers superior benefits to members at lower overall cost to them. Value-based Medicare contracts (such as Medicare Advantage and new value-based programs by CMS) are therefore well suited to fixed-income seniors who cannot afford to incur the cost of either 20% co-payments required with fee-for-service Medicare or supplemental insurance coverage to cover such co-payments and certain other benefits that promote access to care and quality of care.
Our Approach
We are entering a new era in healthcare services where value-based care is delivered through an integrated model. We believe that individualization, care coordination, analytics and risk management produce the best healthcare outcomes and results. With this in mind, we believe that we can simultaneously deliver value to patients, providers and payors.
Patients: At our owned medical centers, our members are offered services in modern, clean, contemporary facilities, with same or next day appointments, integrated virtual care, wellness services, ancillary services (such as physiotherapy), home services, transportation, telemedicine and a 24/7 urgency line, all without additional cost to them. This broad-based care model is critical to our success in delivering care to members of low-income communities, including large minority and immigrant populations, with complex care needs, many of whom previously had very limited or no access to quality healthcare. We are proud of the impact we have made in these underserved communities.
Providers: We believe that providers want to be clinicians. Our employed physicians enjoy a collegial, near-academic environment and the tools and multi-disciplinary support they need to focus on medicine, their patients and their families rather than administrative matters like pre-authorizations, referrals, billing and coding. Our physicians receive ongoing training through regular clinical meetings to review the latest findings in primary care medicine. In addition, our physicians are eligible to receive a bonus based upon patient results, including the reduction in patient emergency room visits and hospital admission, among other metrics.
Payors: Payors want three things: high-quality care, membership growth and effective medical cost management. We have a multi-year and multi-geography track record of delivering on all three. Our proven track record of high-quality ratings has increased the premiums paid by CMS to health plans, our quality primary-care has driven membership growth, and our scaled, highly professional value- based provider group has delivered quality care.
We enter into employment agreements with our employed providers to deliver services to patients. We also contract with independent physicians and group practices that we do not own through our managed services organization. We enter into Primary Care Physician Provider Agreements with affiliated physicians pursuant to which we provide administrative services, including payor and specialty provider contract negotiation, credentialing, coding, and managed care analytics. We pay the affiliates a primary care fee and a portion of the surplus of premium in excess of third-party medical costs. The surplus portion paid to affiliates is recorded as direct patient expense. These administrative services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations.
The Cano Health Care Delivery Platform
The key attributes of the Cano Health care delivery platform are:
CanoPanorama: To turn our principles into results that benefit our members, providers and the healthcare system as a whole, we have created a proprietary and scalable population health management platform known as CanoPanorama. Typically, information across the health system is fragmented and providers lack the resources or skills to get a complete picture regarding a patient. CanoPanorama is designed to solve this issue. It is a purpose-built population health management platform that provides analytics, reports and protocols that inform key care management activities by our employees and physicians. Through CanoPanorama, we have developed processes designed to ensure members receive the right care and physicians receive the right support by utilizing dynamic risk stratification and driving proactive member engagement. CanoPanorama efficiently integrates all member data into one consolidated and centralized repository. For more information about CanoPanorama, see “CanoPanorama, Our Proprietary and Scalable Population Health Management Platform.”
Clinical excellence: While our members tend to be sicker than the average Medicare patient, we believe they have better outcomes than comparable Medicare patients. For example, in 2020 our medical center Medicare Advantage members had a mortality rate of 2.4%, 60% lower than the 6.0% mortality rate for traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Similarly, in 2020 our Medicare Advantage members had fewer hospital stays (213 hospital admissions per thousand members as compared to a Medicare benchmark of 275, which represents a 23% improvement) and fewer emergency room visits (512 emergency room visits per thousand members as compared to a Medicare benchmark of 1,061, which represents a 52% improvement). The Medicare mortality rate and benchmarks are derived from an Avalere Health analysis of 2020 CMS data for non-dual and dual 
eligible Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and weighted to mirror Cano Health’s Medicare Advantage population. In 2020, the HEDIS quality score for our members, a tool used by health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service, was 4.7 out of 5.0, as compared to the national average of 4.16.
Patient focus: We focus on the Medicare-eligible population, particularly through the Medicare Advantage program. This population generally has complex needs which, if properly managed, represent the greatest potential for improved health outcomes. Patient satisfaction can be measured by a provider’s Net Promoter Score ("NPS"), which measures the loyalty of customers to a company. We believe our high NPS speaks to our ability to deliver high quality care with superior member satisfaction. In addition to quality medical services and care management programs, we also provide members with social services to keep them active and engaged with others. Dental services and pharmacy delivery are available in many locations.
Relationships with leading health plans: We have established strong relationships with numerous health plans and are an essential component of their provider network. We are capable of delivering membership growth, clinical quality and medical cost management based on our care coordination strategy, differentiated quality metrics and strong relationships with members. We have established ourselves as a top-quality provider across multiple Medicare and Medicaid payors including Humana, Anthem, CVS, Centene, and UnitedHealthcare.
CanoPanorama, Our Proprietary and Scalable Population Health Management Platform
The backbone of our value-based care delivery platform is CanoPanorama, our purpose-built population health management system that provides analytics, reports, and protocols that inform key care management activities by our clinical and non-clinical employees and affiliate physicians. Through CanoPanorama, we have developed processes designed to ensure members receive the right care and physicians receive the right support by acting on dynamic risk stratification and proactive member engagement.
Our proprietary technology-powered model provides the healthcare providers at our medical centers with a 360-degree view of our members along with actionable insights to empower better care decisions and high member engagement. Using CanoPanorama at the time of member enrollment, we are able to identify different patient risk levels, which allows our primary care providers to design and establish more efficient and effective personalized care plans for our members. Following enrollment, CanoPanorama continues to collect data on members from multiple sources and allows our providers to proactively and dynamically deliver individualized care based on changes in the member’s health, all the while allowing us to create targeted campaigns for high- risk members. This allows us to risk stratify our members and apply a highly personalized approach to primary care, chronic care, preventive care and each member’s broader healthcare needs.
CanoPanorama efficiently integrates data from our electronic medical records, care management systems and payors into one consolidated and centralized repository. The population health management platform digests and produces information in a uniform way, providing reports and unique and personalized analytics. The system is designed to cover the entire patient care experience in and outside of our medical center locations and efficiently allows for end-to-end care coordination. For example, CanoPanorama can use social determinants of health to inform care coordination, support the 24/7 urgency line by routing data to other parts of the Company, generate action based on algorithms that push alerts to trigger a visit from our Cano@Home service or home delivery of medication with protocols in place designed to ensure medication compliance, utilize data to encourage participation in our wellness program, Cano Life, and route alerts for hospital visits through connectivity with the hospital information exchange. These alerts allow our care managers to intervene immediately to work on discharge protocols as well as transitions of care.
The CanoPanorama system also enables us to establish rigorous measurement protocols across our Company measuring everything from clinical results and member outcomes, to employee satisfaction, to transportation services and member satisfaction. The most important of these measures are included in the key performance indicator reports regularly monitored by our senior management team. This system enables us to take proactive actions where necessary creating a cycle of continuous improvement. CanoPanorama also provides value to our employees and physicians by enabling efficient onboarding of employees and offers support to physicians to optimize quality and utilization. 
Long-Standing Relationships and Preferred Provider with Leading Health Plans
We have established strong relationships with numerous health plans and are an essential component of their provider networks. In an industry shifting to value-based care, we are a sophisticated and proven solution of scale within a highly fragmented market. Health plans look to achieve three goals when partnering with a provider: membership growth, clinical quality and medical cost management. We are capable of delivering all three based on our care coordination strategy, differentiated quality metrics and strong relationships with members. We have established ourselves as a top-quality provider across multiple Medicare and Medicaid payors including Humana, Anthem, CVS, Centene, and UnitedHealthcare.
In particular, we are an important partner for Humana, a market leader among Medicare Advantage plans. In Florida, Humana’s largest Medicare Advantage market, we were Humana’s largest independent primary care provider serving more than 68,000 Humana Medicare Advantage members, as of December 31, 2021. Pursuant to certain agreements with Humana, as of December 31, 2021, we operated eleven medical centers in Texas and Nevada for which Humana is the exclusive health plan for Medicare Advantage products. Humana has been granted a right of first refusal on any sale, lease, license or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets, businesses, divisions or subsidiaries that constitute 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of, or any equity transaction (including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, exchange offer, spin-off, split-off, reorganization or sale of securities) that results in a change of control of, PCIH, Primary Care (ITC) Holdings, LLC, which is referred to herein as the Seller, or the Company or its subsidiary, HP MSO, LLC. If exercised, Humana would have the right to acquire the assets or equity interests by matching the terms of the proposed sale transaction.
Our Multi-Pronged Growth Strategy
Our flexible, multi-pronged development strategy in both existing and new markets is designed to promote rapid growth primarily through (i) ongoing organic growth in current markets, (ii) continued expansion into new markets across the nation, (iii) execution of our accretive acquisition strategy and (iv) multiple value-based care opportunities.
Organic Growth in Current Markets
We have a proven track record of organic membership growth. Organic membership growth is driven by increasing capacity at existing medical centers, building de novo medical centers, consolidating the best-performing of our existing affiliates and adding small practices whose patients and medical centers are blended with our nearby owned medical centers.
 In medical centers that are approaching full capacity, we are able to augment our footprint by expanding our existing medical centers, and by opening de novo centers or acquiring centers that are more convenient for our members. Importantly, we are able to leverage our affiliate providers to enhance growth in a very capital- efficient manner by acquiring the best-performing affiliates and adding these providers to new or existing medical centers.
Continued Expansion into New Geographies
We have successfully entered into seven new states and Puerto Rico since 2017 and were operating in Florida, Texas, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Illinois, California and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2021. When entering a new market, we tailor our entry strategy to the characteristics of the specific market and provide a customized solution to meet that market’s needs. When choosing a market to enter, we look at various factors, including (i) Medicare population density, (ii) underserved demographics, (iii) existing payor relationships and (iv) specialist and hospital access/capacity. We typically choose a location that is highly visible and accessible and work to enhance brand development pre-entry. Our flexible medical center design allows us to adjust to local market needs by building medical centers that generally range from approximately 7,000 to 20,000 square feet that may include ancillary services such as pharmacies, mental health, and dental services. We seek to grow member engagement through targeted multi-channel marketing, community outreach and use of mobile clinics to expand our reach. When entering a new market, based on its characteristics and economics, we decide whether to buy existing medical centers, build de novo medical centers or to help manage members’ healthcare via affiliate relationships. This highly flexible model enables us to choose the right solution for each market.
Execute on Accretive Acquisitions
We supplement our organic growth through our accretive acquisition strategy, which allows us to enter new markets, and extend our services. We have a successful acquisition and integration track record. For additional information regarding certain of our recent acquisitions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
— Key Factors Affecting Our Performance — Significant Acquisitions.” We have established a rigorous data-driven approach and the necessary infrastructure to identify, acquire and quickly integrate targets. We not only integrate the new medical centers into our population health management system, CanoPanorama, but also invest in marketing, technology and operations for our acquired medical centers, which helps increase enrollment, improve documentation and coding and drive efficient workflows. We have also developed detailed processes and maintain dedicated teams for managing acquisition and integration activities. 
Direct Contracting / ACO REACH
Direct contracting is a new delivery pilot in which CMS contracts directly with providers designated as direct contracting entities ("DCEs") and is part of CMS’ strategy to drive broader healthcare reform and accelerate the shift from original fee-for-service Medicare toward value-based care models. A key aspect of direct contracting is providing new opportunities for a variety of different DCEs to participate in capitated arrangements in Medicare fee-for-service. Relative to existing initiatives, the payment model options also include a reduced set of quality measures that focus more on outcomes and beneficiary experience than on process. Our wholly owned subsidiary, American Choice Healthcare, LLC, was one of 41 unique companies chosen by CMS as a DCE. We are now participating in the Global and Direct Contracting Performance Period, which runs from April 1, 2021 until December 31, 2026. 
On February 24, 2022 the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (the “CMMI”) announced it was sunsetting the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model in its current form, and transitioning certain participants and members into a newly established model, called ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (REACH), beginning next year. Additionally, regulators are shelving the geographic direct contracting model, which was launched in December 2020 and paused in March 2021, effective immediately. CMMI is releasing a Request for Applications (RFA) to solicit a cohort of participants for the Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (ACO REACH) Model. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said it has redesigned the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model (GPDC) in response to Administration priorities, including the commitment to advancing health equity, stakeholder feedback, and participant experience. CMS is renaming the model the ACO REACH Model to better align the name with the purpose of the model: to improve the quality of care for people with Medicare through better care coordination, reaching and connecting health care providers and beneficiaries, including those beneficiaries who are underserved, a priority of the Biden-Harris Administration. 
The new cohort will begin participation in the ACO REACH Model on January 1, 2023. Current GPDC Model participants must maintain a strong compliance record and agree to meet all the ACO REACH Model requirements by January 1, 2023 to continue participating in the ACO REACH Model as ACOs. 
Seasonality to Our Business
Our operational and financial results experience some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. This variability is most notable in the following areas:
Capitated Revenue Per Member 
Excluding the impact of large scale shifts in membership demographics or acuity, our Medicare Advantage capitated revenue per member per month ("PMPM”) will generally decline over the course of the year. As the year progresses, Medicare Advantage PMPM typically declines as new members join us with less complete or accurate documentation in the previous year (and therefore lower current year MRA). 
Medical Costs 
Medical costs vary seasonally depending on a number of factors. Typically, we experience higher utilization levels during the first quarter of the year due to influenza and other seasonal illnesses. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period. Shorter periods will typically have lesser medical costs due to fewer business days. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days compared to another. Additionally, we generally accrue stop loss reimbursements from September through December (as patients reach stop loss thresholds) which can result in reduced medical expenses during the third and fourth quarter due to recoveries. 
Organic Member Growth
We experience organic member growth throughout the year as existing Medicare Advantage plan members choose our 
providers and during special enrollment periods when certain eligible individuals can enroll in Medicare Advantage plans during the year. We experience some seasonality with respect to organic enrollment, which is generally higher during the fourth and first quarters, driven by Medicare Advantage plan advertising and marketing campaigns and plan enrollment selections made during the annual open enrollment period. We also grow through serving new and existing traditional Medicare, Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid, and Commercial patients. 
Governmental Regulations
Our operations and those of our affiliated physician entities are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things; training and education of our employees and contractors on appropriate legal and regulatory requirements; the submission of bills and claims for payment to third-party payors and patients (including appropriate coding for services and items provided); as well as reports to government payment programs; primary care centers and equipment; dispensing of pharmaceuticals, management of centers, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs and patient care. If any of our operations or those of our affiliated physicians are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:
•suspension or termination of our participation in government and/or private payment programs;
•refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;
•loss of our licenses required to operate healthcare medical centers, dispense pharmaceuticals, or provide ancillary services in the states in which we operate;
•criminal or civil liability, fines, damages, exclusion from participating in federal and state healthcare programs and/or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, or the CMPL, the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, the False Claims Act, or the FCA, and/or state analogs to these federal enforcement authorities, or other regulatory requirements;
•enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their health information has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including the regulations implementing the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, or HIPAA;
•mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses or decrease our revenue;
•imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;
•termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, including joint venture arrangements, contracts with payors, real estate leases and provider employment arrangements;
•changes in and reinterpretation of rules and laws by a regulatory agency or court, such as state corporate practice of medicine laws, that could affect the structure and management of our business and its affiliated physician practice corporations;
•negative adjustments or insufficient inflationary adjustments to government payment models including, but not limited to, Medicare Parts A, B, C and D and Medicaid; and
•harm to our reputation, which could negatively impact our business relationships, the terms of payor contracts, our ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, our ability to obtain financing and our access to new business opportunities, among other things.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private payors with whom we contract at any time in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business
—Risks Related to Government Regulation.” Adverse findings from such investigations and audits could bring severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. In addition, private payors could require pre-payment audits of claims, which can negatively affect cash flow, or terminate contracts for repeated deficiencies.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal penalties for the violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment, fines, penalties and exclusion of the provider from future participation in the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include up to $100,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Providers are also subject to permissive exclusion from federal healthcare programs for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute even if not criminally charged. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the statute as amended, the defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the federal Anti- Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti- Kickback Statute are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor may not be subject to sanction under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
We enter into several arrangements that could potentially implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute if requisite intent was present, such as:
•Affiliated Physician Agreements. We enter into a number of different types of agreements with affiliated physicians, including member services agreements, physician leadership agreements, physician services agreements, and recruitment of physicians into our centers. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they do not always satisfy all of the elements of the personal services and management contracts safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and potential whistleblowers.
• Management Services Agreements. We enter into management services agreements with each of our affiliated medical practices. Most of our management services agreements provide for compensation based on a percentage of collections generated by the practice. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they may not always satisfy all of the elements of the personal services and management contracts safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and potential whistleblowers.
•Marketing Arrangements. We enter into arrangements with various individuals and entities to assist us in promoting our services to the public. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they may not always satisfy all of the elements of the personal services and management contracts safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and potential whistleblowers.
•Joint Venture Arrangements. We enter into arrangements with various individuals and entities to jointly operate certain service lines. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they may not always satisfy all of the elements of safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government authorities and whistleblowers.
•Administrative Services Agreements. We enter into arrangements with various entities that provide administrative services to facilitate access to care by our members. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they may not always satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and whistleblowers.
•Acquisitions. Many of our acquisitions are from individuals or entities that will remain in a position to generate referrals to us after the acquisition is complete. Although we endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, they may not always satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor. Although we believe all such agreements are necessary for our legitimate business needs and provide for compensation that is consistent with fair market value, such arrangements could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and whistleblowers.
If any of our business transactions or arrangements were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
As part of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS’s, Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, or Regulatory Sprint, the HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. Specifically, OIG sought to identify ways in which it might modify or add new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute (as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducements provision of the CMPL) in order to foster arrangements that promote care coordination and advance the delivery of value-based care, while also protecting against harms caused by fraud and abuse. Numerous federal agencies have requested comments and information from the public and have published proposed regulations as part of the Regulatory Sprint on areas that have historically been viewed as barriers to innovative care coordination arrangements.
In November 2020, CMS and the OIG issued a final rule adding new exceptions and safe harbors to the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute and made modifications to the CMPL governing inducements provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. OIG identified aspects of the Anti-Kickback Statute and CMPL that posed potential barriers to coordinated care and value-based care and added new safe harbors that attempt to address those barriers. These new Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors allow, among other things, certain outcomes-based payments, care coordination arrangements, the provision of telehealth technologies and arrangements for patient engagement to be structured in such a manner as to be protected from scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although these safe harbors remain new and the healthcare industry is still trying to determine what business models will benefit from such arrangements, we believe these safe harbors give us additional protection as we continue to implement new strategies to better coordinate patient care. Further, we anticipate that the greater flexibility and certainty allowed by the final regulations could give rise to more competition for physicians in our various markets and may make competitors more attractive to our physicians with less integrated and lower-cost business models.
The OIG has expressed concern over the provision of free or discounted items, and services and other remuneration in connection with patient recruitment (including, for example, patient transportation). We attempt to structure any transfer of value to patients in a manner consistent with the Anti-Kickback Statute and related laws, regulations, and guidance issued by OIG.
The civil monetary penalty (CMP) law provision prohibit inducements to beneficiaries (Beneficiary Inducements CMP), 42 U.S.C. § 1320a7a(a)(5). The Beneficiary Inducements CMP provides for the imposition of CMPs against any person who offers or transfers remuneration to a Medicare or State health care program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier for the order or receipt of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by Medicare or a State health care program. Although we endeavor to operate within the confines of the CMP with respect to beneficiary inducements we may not always satisfy all of the elements of applicable safe harbors and, as such, could be subjected to scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and potential whistleblowers for practices such as complimentary transportation, modest meals for patients, wellness programs, our “Cano Life” program or other patient engagement activities.
Additionally, numerous federal agencies have requested comments and information from the public and have published proposed regulations as part of the Regulatory Sprint on areas that have historically been viewed as barriers to innovative care coordination arrangements. Additionally, the HHS Office of Civil Rights ("OCR") OCR is also involved, and has called for information from the public regarding ways that the HIPAA regulations could be modernized to support coordinated, value-based care.
Risk Bearing Provider Regulation
Certain of the states where we currently operate (e.g. California) regulate, and other states we, may choose to operate in the future, regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing providers like us and our affiliated providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, requirements to register as a risk-bearing organization, governance controls and other similar matters. While these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date, as we continue to expand, these rules may require additional resources and capitalization and add complexity to our business.
Stark Law
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing Designated Health Services, or DHS, from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and at least one court have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid. DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. The Stark Law also prohibits self-referrals within an organization by its own physicians, although broad exceptions exist that cover employed physicians and those referring DHS that are ancillary to the physician’s practice to the physician group. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law is a strict liability violation where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated.
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the prohibition, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law prohibition, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and potential exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within 60 days after the date on which 
the overpayment was identified. Furthermore, Stark Law violations and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for FCA liability, as discussed below.
If CMS or other regulatory or enforcement authorities determine that claims have been submitted for referrals by us that violate the Stark Law, we would be subject to the penalties described above. In addition, it might be necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with our physicians. Any such penalties and restructuring or other required actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include outpatient physician services. Since most services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided in our centers are physician services, our services generally do not implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain ancillary services we may provide, including, but not limited to, certain diagnostic testing, outpatient prescription pharmaceutical services and physical therapy, may be considered DHS.
We have entered into several types of financial relationships with physicians, including compensation arrangements. If our centers were to bill for a non-exempted service and the financial relationships with the physician did not satisfy an exception, we could be required to change our practices, face civil penalties, pay substantial fines, return certain payments received from Medicare and beneficiaries or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to payments made pursuant to referrals from these physicians under the Stark Law.
In June 2018, CMS issued a request for information seeking input on how to address any undue regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law. CMS placed the request for information in the context of the Regulatory Sprint and stated that it identified aspects of the Stark Law that pose potential barriers to coordinated care. In November 2020, CMS issued a sweeping set of regulations that introduce significant new value-based terminology, safe harbors and exceptions to the Stark Law. Additionally, CMS made a number of changes to certain existing regulations under the Stark Law, including the definition of group practice. The new regulations became effective January 19, 2021, except for certain changes related to the definition of a group practice which took effect January 1, 2022. The changes may require or allow changes in how our centers compensate affiliated physicians for DHS in certain markets. Although the healthcare industry is still trying to determine what business models will benefit from the changes to the Stark Law, we expect that the new exceptions will give us additional protection as we continue to implement new strategies to better coordinate patient care. Further, we anticipate that the greater flexibility and certainty allowed by the final regulations could give rise to more competition for physicians in our various markets and may make competitors more attractive to our physicians by offering less integrated and lower-cost business models. These or other changes implemented by CMS in the future may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Fraud and Abuse under State Law
Some states in which we operate centers have laws prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical centers to which they refer patients. Some of these laws could potentially be interpreted broadly as prohibiting physicians who hold shares of our publicly traded stock or are physician owners from referring patients to our centers if the centers perform services for their patients or do not otherwise satisfy an exception to the law. States also have laws similar to or stricter than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that may affect our ability to receive referrals from physicians with whom we have financial relationships. Some state anti-kickback laws also include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to our physician relationships or for financial interests limited to shares of publicly traded stock. Some, however, may include no explicit exemption for certain types of agreements and/or relationships entered into with physicians. A violation of such laws could result in a prohibition on billing payers for such services, civil or criminal penalties, and adversely affect any licenses that we or our affiliated physicians hold in the state. If these laws are interpreted to apply to physicians who hold equity interests in our centers or to physicians who hold our publicly traded stock, and for which no applicable exception exists, we may be required to terminate or restructure our relationships with these physicians and could be subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, refund requirements and exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
Similarly, states have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements (e.g., transportation), incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. States also may limit the types of marketing activities that we, our centers, and our affiliated physicians may take targeted 
towards patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
We enter into employment agreements with our employed providers to deliver services to patients. We also contract with independent physicians and group practices that we do not own through our managed services organization relationships. We enter into Primary Care Physician Provider Agreements with affiliated practices pursuant to which we provide administrative and management services, including payor and specialty provider contract negotiation, credentialing, coding, and managed care analytics. We pay the affiliate a primary care fee and a portion of the surplus of premium in excess of third-party medical costs. The surplus portion paid to affiliates is recorded as direct patient expense. . We also enter into certain agreements with providers of administrative services to facilitate services for our members in exchange for a fee. These administrative services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations.
The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state and many states prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. There is often limited regulatory guidance regarding applicable limitations on the corporate practice of medicine. Additionally, these prohibitions are subject to new and more expansive interpretations by the courts and regulatory bodies. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, other parties may assert that, despite the way we are structured, we could be engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee-splitting. Were such allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and we may be required to restructure our contractual arrangements.
Regulations of the corporate practice of medicine vary by state and may result in physicians being subject to disciplinary action, as well as to forfeiture of revenues from payers for services rendered. Violations may also bring both civil and, in more extreme cases, criminal liability for non-professional or "lay" entities engaging in the practice of medicine without a professional license. Some of the relevant laws, regulations and agency interpretations in states with corporate practice of medicine restrictions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. In limited cases, courts have required management services companies to divest or reorganize structures deemed to violate corporate practice restrictions. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Any allegations or findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including adversely impacting our relationship with affiliated physicians and our ability to recruit new physicians into our centers.
The False Claims Act
The federal FCA is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the healthcare delivery system. Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
•knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or
•conspires to commit the above acts.
In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment 
and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. As a result of these provisions, our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments may be subject to greater scrutiny.
The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $11,803 to $23,607 per false claim or statement (as of December 31, 2021, and subject to annual adjustments for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim.
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid, and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage plans. The ACA provides that claims tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The FCA contains so called “qui tam” provisions that permit private citizens known as relators, to file FCA complaints on behalf of the government. Relators are awarded with a percentage of the damages recovery under any action brought by them that results in a settlement or judgment. The majority of FCA claims are initiated by relators. This aspect of the FCA significantly raises the risk that any provider will at some point be the target of a suit under the FCA’s qui tom provision. 
In addition to the FCA, the various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs.
Civil Monetary Penalties and Exclusion Statutes
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, and the Exclusion Statute, 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7, authorize the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
•presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
•offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider;
•arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs;
•violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
•making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program;
•making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program;
•failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government;
•being convicted of fraud, theft, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or any other financial misconduct relating to health care;
•being convicted of illegally manufacturing, distributing, prescribing or dispensing a controlled substance;
•being convicted of any crime related to the Medicare program;
•being convicted of fraud in connection with non-health care programs;
•being convicted of obstructing an audit or investigation;
•having an entity controlled by a sanctioned individual or by a family or household member of an excluded individual where there has been a transfer of ownership/control;
•filing claims for excessive charges, unnecessary services or services which fail to meet professionally recognized standards of health care; and
•making false statement or misrepresentations of material fact.
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.
We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and the Exclusion Statue would apply. We perform monthly checks on our employees, affiliated providers and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual. Likewise, our patient programs, which can include enhancements, incentives and additional care coordination not otherwise covered under traditional Medicare, could be alleged to be intended to influence the patient’s choice in obtaining services or the amount or types of services sought. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and/or the Exclusion Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Privacy and Security
The federal regulations promulgated under the authority of HIPAA require us to provide certain protections to patients and their health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information ("PHI") and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and their business associates, to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In instances where we act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond our status as a covered entity.
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.
Violations of HIPAA by providers like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $60,226 per 
violation and up to $1.807 million per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PHI and other types of personal identifiable information ("PII"). State statutes and regulations vary from state to state, and these laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing interpretations, and we expect new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future. In the event that new data security laws are implemented, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements, or such requirements may not be compatible with our current processes. Changing our processes could be time consuming and expensive, and failure to timely implement required changes could subject us to liability for non-compliance. Some states also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their PII has been misused. This complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and potentially restricts our ability to collect, use and disclose data and exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability.
Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, including bloodborne pathogens standards, require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare medical centers, including primary care centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or offer hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.
Our pharmacies are licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. In addition, our pharmacists and nurses are licensed in those states where we believe their activity requires it. Our various pharmacy facilities also maintain certain Medicare and state Medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs. Participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations, and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs. In addition, several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under Medicare Part D and, as a condition to becoming a participating provider under Medicare Part D, the pharmacies are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to Medicare Part D.
Our operations are subject to various state law requirements for licensure of ancillary services such as lab services and operation of radiological equipment, federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, Drug Enforcement Administration standards for administering and prescribing controlled substances and distributing drug samples, reporting financial relationships with drug, biologicals and medical device companies, and numerous other federal, state and local laws governing the day-to-day provision of medical services by our centers.
Federal and state law also govern the dispensing of prescription medications by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs, among other things the distribution of drug samples. Physicians are required to report relationships they have with the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologics through the Open Payments Program database.
Further, federal and state law in each state where we currently operate are increasingly imposing oversight, reporting requirements, and other safeguards on our providers that prescribe opioids and other pain medicine. Texas, for instance, has 
adopted a number of amendments to existing laws and regulatory changes to limit prescription sizes and frequencies and requires providers to access the Texas Prescription Drug Monitoring Program before prescribing or dispensing controlled substances. In addition, federal and state investigators have increased enforcement efforts relative to inappropriate opioid prescribing patterns by providers.
In addition, while none of the states in which we currently operate have required it, certain states in which we may desire to do business in the future have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or expansion of healthcare medical centers, including primary care centers. These regulations can be complex and time-consuming. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. As we expand into new markets in new states we must comply with a variety of health regulatory and other state laws. In California, for example, pursuant to the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act, a risk bearing organization, or RBO, is an entity that (i) contracts directly with a healthcare service plan or arranges for healthcare services for the healthcare service plan’s enrollees; (ii) receives compensation for those services on any capitated or fixed periodic payment basis; and (iii) is responsible for the processing and payment of claims made by providers for services rendered by those providers on behalf of a healthcare service plan when those services are covered under the capitation or fixed periodic payment made by the plan to the RBO. In California, our business meets the definition of an RBO, which requires registration with the California Department of Managed Health Care, meet certain solvency requirements, submit quarterly and annual financial reports (which will be publicly available), and submit quarterly survey reports.
Any allegations or findings that we or our providers have violated or failed to comply with any of the foregoing or other laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Intellectual Property
Our continued growth and success depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and internally developed technology, including CanoPanorama. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business). We continuously evaluate the needs of our providers and the tools that CanoPanorama can provide and make improvements and add new features based on those needs. We continually assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue additional available protections in the future.
Insurance
We maintain insurance, excess coverage, or reinsurance for property and general liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation, cybersecurity and other coverage in amounts and on terms deemed adequate by management, based on our actual claims experience and expectations for future claims. We also utilize stop-loss insurance for our members, protecting us for medical claims per episode in excess of certain levels. Future claims could, however, exceed our applicable insurance coverage.
Competition
While the U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive, the market in which we operate is vast and remains highly fragmented. We compete directly with national, regional and local primary care providers, which consist of solo practitioners or small physician groups, larger group practices often backed by financial sponsors and health system-affiliated practices. Competitors also include regional providers of primary care services such as ChenMed, Iora Health, and Oak Street Health. Among other things, we compete for contracts with payors, recruitment of physicians and other medical and non-medical personnel and ultimately for members. Importantly, our principal competitors for members and capitated payor contracts vary from market to market, and we have experienced limited overlap with these competitors due to the fragmented nature of the value-based care provider competitive landscape.
There are many other companies and individuals currently providing healthcare services, many of which have been in business longer and/or have substantially more resources. There have been increased trends towards consolidation and vertical integration in the healthcare industry, including an influx of additional capital. Due to low barriers of entry in the primary care market, competition for growth in existing and new markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources, or those that traditionally operate in the primary care market. As an example, payors may (and in some cases, may continue to) acquire or build their primary care and other provider assets and implement disruptive technologies to compete with us. Other companies could enter the healthcare industry in the future and divert some or all of our business. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors, including the number of competing primary care medical centers in the local market and the types of services available at those medical centers, our local reputation for quality care of members, the commitment and expertise of our medical staff, our local service offerings and community programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our medical centers. As such, our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected with increased competition levels. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Risks Related to Competition.”
We believe building a competitive value-based primary care offering is no easy task. Technological expertise (e.g., development of an effective and scalable population health management platform), branding and marketing requirements, payor partnerships, corporate culture, member-care protocols and material start-up costs associated with the build-out process, are significant barriers to entry that may limit direct competition in the near term.
Overall, we believe in improving access to care in underserved communities, enhancing quality of care and promoting wellness results in superior clinical outcomes and high member satisfaction. We believe this combination of factors will allow us to compete favorably in any market.
Human Capital Management
We believe our employed physicians, other clinical professionals and administrative employees are key to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 400 providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) across our 130 owned medical centers, maintained affiliate relationships with over 1,000 physicians and approximately 750 clinical support employees focused on supporting physicians in enabling patient care and experience. Our affiliated providers deliver critical medical care primarily to underserved and dual-eligible (i.e., eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) populations, many of whom live in economically disadvantaged and minority communities.
We believe that our mantra – “together for a healthier, happier you” – is realized by the engagement and empowerment of our affiliated physicians, other clinicians and administrative employees. Our Chief People Officer (“CPO”) is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on our strategy and the design of employee compensation and benefits programs. Our CPO reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and regularly engages with our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee. In addition, our Human Resources department provides us within a core administrative support function. Through its functional experts, our Human Resources team provides support and guidance in the areas of talent acquisition, employee wellness and safety programs, workplace policies and procedures, employee relations, training and development and rewards strategies that include compensation, benefits and other rewards. It is the goal of our Human Resources department to support the needs of our organization and workforce while serving as a trusted strategic partner to our management team.
Training and Leadership Development
We are committed to the continued development of our people and believe in fostering great leaders. Our training and development team is committed to providing an environment that fosters both individual and organizational development. We make available a catalog of over 165 courses to all audiences across subjects including business best practices, leadership and management, office productivity, technical skills, health and wellness and personal development, among others. The courses are designed to develop people into leaders and shape a great company. Our training materials were enhanced with additional resources to support remote work environments required due to COVID-19.
Compliance Program and Training
Fundamental to our core values are people and a culture of integrity. Our Compliance Department is led by our Chief Compliance Officer & General Counsel. The Compliance Program is supported by a written Compliance Plan, which details the components, organizational structure and operational aspects of the Compliance Program. Although the Compliance Program is supported by numerous operational policies and procedures, there are some key elements that are critical to its success. These include a written Code of Conduct; new hire and periodic compliance training for all employees; and exclusion screening, compliance reporting mechanisms. Annual participation in compliance trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses are at 100%.
Health and Well-Being
We care about the health and well-being of our affiliated clinicians, other clinical professionals and our administrative employees and their families and are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We support all of our colleagues in encouraging habits of wellness, increased awareness of factors and resources that contribute to overall well-being and inspire individuals to take responsibility for their own health. When individuals take great care of themselves, we can continue to take great care of our patients and take great care of our business.
We provide all eligible employees and their family members with access to an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal and/or work-related problems. Our EAP addresses a broad and complex body of issues affecting mental and emotional well-being, such as alcohol and other substance abuse, stress, grief, family problems, and psychological disorders. EAP counselors also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs. The EAP is designed to help our colleagues lead happier and more productive lives at home and at work. Our EAP services are available to all eligible employees, their spouses or domestic partners, dependent children, parents and parents-in-law. We encourage all of our employees and their family members to make full use of this resource which is designed to help maintain high employee productivity, health, and well-being in all aspects of life.
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to make diversity, equality and inclusion a priority. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our total headcount was female and approximately 75% of our total headcount identified as part of a minority group. Among our affiliated physicians and other clinical professionals, approximately 71% was female and approximately 86% identified as part of a minority group. Among the executive and senior executive level and manager group, approximately 28% was female and approximately 61% identified as part of a minority group.
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we will continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of any underrepresented population to achieve this goal.
Total Rewards: Compensation and Benefits
We value our colleagues’ contributions to our success and strive to provide all of our colleagues with a competitive and comprehensive total rewards package. This includes robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our affiliated physicians, other clinical professionals and administrative employees.
We take great care to ensure that our compensation packages are reflective of the market value for the work that our colleagues perform. We also understand that providing a comprehensive suite of employee benefits is essential to attracting, retaining and engaging world-class employees. Therefore, we regularly evaluate our benefit offerings to be sure we fully support our employees. In addition to base salaries, these offerings include a combination of annual cash bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, medical, dental, vision and short/long term insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, continuing education, loan repayment assistance program, among other programs.
