Item 1. Description of Business.
 
HMG/Courtland Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries (“HMG”, or the “Company”), is a Delaware corporation organized in 1972. The Company’s business is the ownership and management of income-producing commercial properties and it will consider other investments if they offer growth or profit potential.
 
HMG qualifies under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code for taxation as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), excluding its 95% owned taxable REIT subsidiary Courtland Investments, Inc. (“CII”), which files a separate tax return.
 
As previously reported on Form 8-K dated February 20, 2018, JY-TV Associates, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“JY-TV”) (“Seller”) an entity one-third owned by HMG, completed the sale of its multi-family residential apartments located in Orlando, Florida pursuant to the previously reported Agreement of Sale (the “Agreement”) to Murano 240, LLC (as per an Assignment and Assumption of Agreement of Sale with Cardone Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, an unrelated entity (“Purchaser”). The final sales price was $50,150,000 and the sales proceeds were received in cash and payment of outstanding debt. The gain on the sale to HMG was approximately $5.5 million, net of the incentive fee.
 
The Company invests its idle cash in marketable securities and acquires real estate and other investments utilizing available cash or borrowing funds.
 
The Company’s portfolio of REIT marketable securities consists primarily of preferred equity of large capital publicly traded REITs with a market value of approximately $1.76 million as of December 31, 2018.
 
The Company’s investments in non-REIT marketable securities include equity and debt securities issued primarily by large capital companies or government agencies with readily determinable fair values in varying industries. This includes real estate investment trusts and mutual funds focusing in commercial real estate activities. Substantially all the Company’s marketable securities investments are in companies listed on major national stock markets, however the overall investment portfolio and some of the Company’s investment strategies could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to fluctuations. Consistent with the Company’s overall investment objectives and activities, management classifies all marketable securities as being held in a trading portfolio. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investments in marketable securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable securities are stated at market value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. Information regarding the amounts and types of investments in marketable securities is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Company may realize gains and losses in its overall investment portfolio from time to time to take advantage of market conditions and/or manage the portfolio’s resources and the Company’s tax liability. The Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The use of available leverage is guided by the business judgment of management. The Company may also use options and futures to hedge concentrated stock positions and index futures to hedge against market risk and enhance the performance of the Company’s portfolio while reducing the overall portfolio’s risk and volatility.
 
The Company’s other investments consist primarily of nominal equity interests in various privately-held entities, including limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest venture capital funds in growth-oriented enterprises. The Company does not have significant influence over any investee and the Company’s investments typically represent less than 3% of the investee’s ownership. Some of these investments give rise to exposure resulting from the volatility in capital markets. The Company mitigates its risks by diversifying its investment portfolio. Information with respect to the amounts and types of other investments including the nature of the declines in value is set forth in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
