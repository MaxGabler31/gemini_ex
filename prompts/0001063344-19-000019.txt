Item 1. | Business

OVERVIEW
Hersha Hospitality Trust is a self-advised Maryland real estate investment trust that was organized in 1998 and completed its initial public offering in January of 1999. Our common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HT.” We invest primarily in institutional grade hotels in major urban gateway markets including New York, Washington, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, South Florida and select markets on the West Coast. Our primary strategy is to continue to own high quality luxury, upscale, upper midscale and extended-stay hotels in metropolitan markets with high barriers to entry and independent boutique hotels in markets with similar characteristics. We have operated and intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
We strive to create value through our ability to source capital and identify high growth acquisition targets.  We seek acquisition candidates located in markets with economic, demographic and supply dynamics favorable to hotel owners and operators. Through our due diligence process, we select those acquisition targets where we believe selective capital improvements and intensive management will increase the hotel’s ability to attract key demand segments, enhance hotel operations and increase long-term value. To drive sustainable shareholder value, we also seek to recycle capital from stabilized assets in markets with lower forecasted growth rates. Capital from these types of transactions is intended to be and has been redeployed into high growth acquisitions, share buybacks and reduction of debt.
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 38 wholly owned limited and full service properties with a total of 6,104 rooms, 1 hotel owned through a consolidated joint venture with a total of 115 rooms, and interests in 9 limited service properties owned through joint venture investments with a total of 1,425 rooms. These 48 properties, with a total of 7,644 rooms, are located in California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington and operate under leading brands owned by Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”), Hilton Worldwide, Inc. (“Hilton”), InterContinental Hotels Group (“IHG”), Hyatt Corporation (“Hyatt”), and Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts (“Pan Pacific”). In addition, some of our hotels operate as independent hotels.
We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, and we own our hotels and our investments in joint ventures through our operating partnership, Hersha Hospitality Limited Partnership (the "Partnership"), for which we serve as the sole general partner. As of December 31, 2018, we owned an approximate 91.3% partnership interest in our operating partnership including all of the general partnership interest.
The majority of our wholly-owned hotels are managed by Hersha Hospitality Management, L.P. (“HHMLP”), a privately held, qualified management company owned by certain of our trustees and executive officers and other unaffiliated third party investors. Other third party qualified management companies manage certain hotels that we own through joint venture interests. We lease our wholly-owned hotels to 44 New England Management Company (“44 New England”), our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Each of the hotels that we own through a joint venture investment is leased to another TRS that is owned by the respective joint venture or an entity owned in part by 44 New England.
Our principal executive office is located at 44 Hersha Drive, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17102. Our telephone number is (717) 236-4400. Our website address is www.hersha.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this report.

INVESTMENT IN HOTEL PROPERTIES
Our operating strategy focuses on increasing hotel performance for our portfolio. The key elements of this strategy are:

• | working together with our hotel management companies to increase revenue per available room, or RevPAR, and to maximize the average daily rate, or ADR, and occupancy levels at each of our hotels through active property-level management, including intensive marketing efforts to tour groups, corporate and government extended stay customers and other wholesale customers and expanded yield management programs, which are calculated to better match room rates to room demand; and


• | maximizing our hotel-level earnings by managing hotel-level costs and positioning our hotels to capitalize on increased demand in the high quality, upper-upscale, upscale and extended-stay lodging segments, which we believe can be expected to follow from improving economic conditions, and maximizing our operating margins.

ACQUISITIONS
We selectively acquire high quality branded luxury upper-upscale, upscale, upper-midscale and extended-stay hotels in metropolitan markets with high barriers-to-entry and independent boutique hotels in similar markets. Through our due diligence process, we select those acquisition targets where we believe selective capital improvements and intensive management will increase the hotel’s ability to attract key demand segments, enhance hotel operations and increase long-term value. In executing our disciplined acquisition program, we will consider acquiring hotels that meet the following additional criteria:

• | nationally-franchised hotels operating under popular brand families, such as Marriott, Hilton, IHG, Hyatt, Accor, and Four Seasons;


• | hotels in locations with significant barriers-to-entry, such as high development costs, limited availability of land and lengthy entitlement processes;


• | hotels in our target markets where we can realize operating efficiencies and economies of scale; and


• | independent boutique hotels in similar markets.

All asset acquisitions are comprehensively reviewed by the Acquisition Committee of our Board of Trustees, which consists solely of independent trustees.
Since our initial public offering in January 1999 and through December 31, 2018, we have acquired, wholly or through joint ventures, a total of 120 hotels, including 28 hotels acquired from entities controlled by certain of our trustees and executive officers. Of the 28 acquisitions from entities controlled by certain of our trustees and executive officers, 25 were newly constructed or substantially renovated by these entities prior to our acquisition. We utilize our relationships with entities that are developing or substantially renovating hotels, including entities controlled by certain of our trustees and executive officers, to identify future hotel acquisitions that we believe may be attractive to us. We intend to continue to acquire hotels from entities controlled by certain of our trustees and executive officers if approved by a majority of our independent trustees in accordance with our related party transaction policy.
DISPOSITIONS
We evaluate our hotels and the markets in which they operate on a periodic basis to determine if these hotels continue to satisfy our investment criteria. We may sell hotels opportunistically based upon management’s forecast and review of the cash flow potential of each hotel and re-deploy the proceeds into debt reduction, acquisitions of hotels and share buybacks. We utilize several criteria to determine the long-term potential of our hotels. Hotels are identified for sale based upon management’s forecast of the strength of each hotel’s cash flows, its ability to remain accretive to our portfolio, and the expectations for the market in which the hotel operates. Our decision to sell a hotel is often predicated upon the size of the hotel, strength of the franchise, property condition and related costs to renovate the property, strength of market demand generators, projected supply of hotel rooms in the market, probability of increased valuation and geographic profile of the hotel. All asset sales are comprehensively reviewed by the Acquisition Committee of our Board of Trustees. Since our initial public offering in 1999 through December 31, 2018, we have sold a total of 78 hotels, including certain hotels contributed to joint ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest.
For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and Note 2, “Investment in Hotel Properties”.

FINANCING
We intend to finance our long-term growth with common and preferred equity issuances and debt financing with staggered maturities. Our debt includes unsecured debt in the aggregate of $951 million which is comprised of a $457 million senior unsecured credit facility (which includes a $207 million unsecured term loan and $250 million unsecured revolving line of credit), and two unsecured term loans totaling $493.9 million.  Our debt also includes secured mortgage debt on our hotel properties.  We intend to use our revolving line of credit capacity to pay down mortgage debt, repurchase common shares subject to market conditions, and fund future acquisitions, as well as for capital improvements and working capital requirements. Subject to market conditions, we intend to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility from time to time with proceeds from periodic common and preferred equity issuances, long-term debt financings and cash flows from operations. When purchasing hotel properties, we may issue common and preferred limited partnership interests in our operating partnership as full or partial consideration to sellers.
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS
Franchisors provide a variety of benefits for franchisees, which include national advertising, publicity and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous review of quality standards and centralized reservation systems. Most of our hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel franchisors, including:
໿
Franchisor | Franchises 
Marriott International | Ritz-Carlton, Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott, TownePlace Suites, Sheraton Hotels
Hilton Hotels Corporation | Hilton Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn 
IHG | Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn Express & Suites, Candlewood Suites 
Hyatt Hotels Corporation | Hyatt House, Hyatt Place, Hyatt 
Pan Pacific Hotel Group | Pan Pacific 

We anticipate a majority of the hotels in which we invest will be operated pursuant to franchise licenses.
The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. The franchise licenses generally obligate our lessees to comply with the franchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to training of operational personnel, safety, maintaining specified insurance, the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided by our lessees, display of signage, and the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. In general, the franchise licenses require us to pay the franchisor a fee typically ranging between 6.0% and 9.3% of such hotel’s revenues annually.
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
We work closely with our hotel management companies to operate our hotels and increase hotel performance for our portfolio.
Through our TRS and our investment in joint ventures, we have retained the following management companies to operate our hotels as of December 31, 2018:
໿
﻿ | Wholly Owned | Joint Ventures | | Total 
Manager | Hotels | Rooms | | Hotels | Rooms | Hotels | | Rooms
Hersha Hospitality Management, L.P. | 37 | | 6,018 | | 7 | | 1,087 | | 44 | 7,105
South Bay Boston Management, Inc. | — | | — | | 2 | | 338 | | 2 | 338 
Marriott Management | 1 | | 86 | | 1 | | 115 | | 2 | 201 
Total | 38 | | 6,104 | | 10 | | 1,540 | | 48 | 7,644

Each management agreement provides for a set term and is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of defaults and certain other events described therein. As required under the REIT qualification rules, all managers, including HHMLP, must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” during the term of the management agreements.
8

Under the management agreements, the manager generally pays the operating expenses of our hotels. All operating expenses or other expenses incurred by the manager in performing its authorized duties are reimbursed or borne by our applicable TRS to the extent the operating expenses or other expenses are incurred within the limits of the applicable approved hotel operating budget. Our managers are not obligated to advance any of their own funds for operating expenses of a hotel or to incur any liability in connection with operating a hotel.
For their services, the managers receive a base management fee, and if a hotel meets and exceeds certain thresholds, an additional incentive management fee. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these thresholds were met for one management agreement and incentive management fees of $98 thousand were earned. The base management fee for a hotel is due monthly and is generally equal to 3% of the gross revenues associated with that hotel for the related month.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, RENOVATION AND REFURBISHMENT
Under certain loan agreements, we have established capital reserves for our hotels to maintain the hotels in a condition that complies with their respective requirements. These capital reserves typically range from 3% to 5% of each hotel’s gross revenues. In addition, we may upgrade hotels in our portfolio in order to capitalize on opportunities to increase revenue, and, as deemed necessary by our management, to seek to meet competitive conditions and preserve asset quality. We will also renovate hotels when we believe the investment in renovations will provide an attractive return to us through increased revenues and profitability and is in the best interests of our shareholders. We maintain a capital expenditures policy by which replacements and renovations are monitored to determine whether they qualify as capital improvements. All items that are deemed to be repairs and maintenance costs are expensed and recorded in Hotel Operating Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
OPERATING PRACTICES
Our hotel managers utilize centralized accounting and data processing systems, which facilitate financial statement and budget preparation, payroll management, quality control and other support functions for the on-site hotel management team. Our hotel managers also provide centralized control over purchasing and project management (which can create economies of scale in purchasing) while emphasizing local discretion within specific guidelines.
DISTRIBUTIONS
We have made 80 consecutive quarterly distributions to the holders of our common shares since our initial public offering in January 1999 and intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to our shareholders as approved by our Board of Trustees.
The following table sets forth distribution information for the last two calendar years.

Our Board of Trustees will determine the amount of our future distributions in its sole discretion and its decision will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of funds from operations, our partnership’s financial condition, debt service requirements, capital expenditure requirements for our hotels, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the trustees deem relevant. Our ability to make distributions will depend on the profitability of and cash flow available from our hotels. There can be no assurance we will continue to pay distributions at the rates above or any other rate. Additionally, we may, if necessary and allowable, pay taxable distributions of our shares or debt securities to meet the distribution requirements. There are no assurances we will be able to continue to make quarterly distributions at the current rate.
SEASONALITY
Our hotels’ operations historically have been seasonal in nature, reflecting lower revenues and occupancy rates during the first quarter of each year when compared to the remaining three quarters. This seasonality causes fluctuations in our quarterly operating revenues, profitability, and cash flow.
COMPETITION
The U.S. hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, location, quality of accommodations, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, service levels and amenities, and level of customer service. In addition to traditional hotels, our properties also compete with non-traditional accommodations for travelers such as online room sharing services. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under premium brands in the focused-service and full-service segments. We believe that hotels, such as our hotels, that are affiliated with leading national brand families, such as the Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, or Pan Pacific will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands. Increased competition could harm our occupancy and revenues and may require us to provide additional amenities or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results and liquidity.
The upper-upscale and upscale limited service segments of the hotel business are highly competitive.  There are many competitors in our markets and new hotels are routinely being constructed. Additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms.
10

We also compete for hotel acquisitions with entities that have investment objectives similar to ours. We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds, private equity funds, REITs, hotel companies and others who are engaged in the acquisition of hotels. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us, increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had 54 employees who were principally engaged in managing the affairs of the Company unrelated to property operations.  We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
TAX STATUS
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. As long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our income that is currently distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax for the years prior to 2018) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.  Additionally, we will generally be unable to qualify as a REIT for four years following the year in which qualification is lost.  Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
We own interests in several TRSs. We may own up to 100% of the stock of a TRS. A TRS is a taxable corporation that may lease hotels from our operating partnership and its subsidiaries under certain circumstances. Overall, no more than 20% of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRS. In addition, no more than 25% of our gross income for any year may consist of dividends from one or more TRS and income from certain non-real estate related sources.
A TRS is permitted to lease hotels from us as long as the hotels are operated on behalf of the TRS by a third party manager that qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." To qualify for that treatment, the manager must satisfy the following requirements:

1. | such manager is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating “qualified lodging facilities” for any person unrelated to us and the TRS;


2. | such manager does not own, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of our shares;


3. | no more than 35% of such manager is owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons owning 35% or more of our shares; and


4. | we do not, directly or indirectly, derive any income from such manager.

The deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to us is limited to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation, and in certain circumstances, other limitations on deductions of interest may apply. A 100% excise tax is imposed on transactions between a TRS and us that are not on an arm’s-length basis.
Additional Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of certain additional material U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to the ownership of our shares. This summary supplements and should be read together with “Federal Income Tax Consequences Of Our Status As A REIT” in the prospectus dated February 28, 2017 and filed as part of our registration statement on Form S-3ASR (No. 333-216317).
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. As of January 1, 2018, (1) the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is reduced to 21%, (2) the highest marginal individual income tax rate is reduced to 37%, (3) the corporate alternative minimum tax is repealed, (4) the backup withholding rate for U.S. shareholders is reduced to 24%, and (5) the maximum rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. shareholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests is also reduced from 35% to 21%. In addition, under proposed Treasury regulations, withholding under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) will not apply to proceeds from the sale of our capital shares by non-U.S. shareholders. FATCA withholding continues to apply to our dividends paid to non-U.S. shareholders if those shareholders do not meet certain disclosure requirements.

REGULATION
General
Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our hotels must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1993, or ADA, to the extent that such hotels are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters
Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability or materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance.
Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
INSURANCE
We require comprehensive insurance to be maintained by our hotel management companies, including HHMLP, on each of our hotels, including liability and fire and extended coverage in amounts sufficient to permit the replacement of the hotel in the event of a total loss, subject to applicable deductibles. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and acts of terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impracticable to use insurance proceeds to replace the applicable hotel after such applicable hotel has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received by us might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the applicable hotel. If any of these or similar events occur, it may reduce the return from the attached property and the value of our investment.
12

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
We allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels and consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment.  No operating segment, individually, meets the threshold for a reportable segment as defined within ASC Topic 280 – Segment Reporting, nor do they fully satisfy the requisite aggregation criteria therein.  As a result, the Company does not present separate operating segment information within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for segment financial information.
