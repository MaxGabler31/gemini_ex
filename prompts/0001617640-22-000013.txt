Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to give people the power to unlock life’s next chapter. As the most visited real estate website in the United States, Zillow and its affiliates help high-intent movers find and win their home through digital solutions, first class partners and easier buying, selling, financing and renting experiences. Millions of people visit our mobile applications and websites every month to begin their journey. Traffic to our services reached an annual monthly high of 234 million unique users in July 2021, with more than 10.2 billion visits to our mobile applications and websites in 2021, primarily to Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy.
At the core of Zillow is our living database of more than 135 million U.S. homes and our differentiated content, most notably the Zestimate, our patented proprietary automated valuation model through which we provide home value estimates. With the launch of the Zestimate in 2006, we introduced important transparency to residential real estate in order to empower consumers to make better decisions. Our improved Zestimate currently has a median absolute percent error of 2.65% for homes listed for sale and 7.26% for off-market homes. Our data and content has helped the Zillow brand become synonymous with residential real estate. Today, more people search for “Zillow” than “real estate,” according to a 2021 Google Trends report, and Zillow is the most visited brand in the online real estate industry according to a 2021 Comscore Media Metrix® report.
Our position as the leading online residential real estate company in the United States today has afforded us the opportunity to significantly expand our strategy over the past several years. We have evolved from an advertising lead generation model to a transactional model that is more directly involved with our customers’ moving journeys. With that, our strategic expansion has dramatically increased our Total Addressable Market (“TAM”) from $19 billion in residential real estate related advertising (according to a 2019 Borrell Associates report) to approximately $300 billion of the $2 trillion residential real estate market, derived from transaction fees from our real estate partners, advertising from rental professionals, and revenue earned from mortgage originations and title and escrow service fees (according to the National Association of REALTORS® U.S. Economic Outlook published in November 2021, Fortune Business Insights 2021 Property Management Market Size Report and the Mortgage Bankers Association® 2020 Production Volume Report, respectively).
We meet our customers primarily on our mobile applications and websites, where we help them find their next home and make their moving experience easier. We do this through a combination of trusted partners – Premier Agents, property managers, lenders, and homebuilders – as well as directly-owned transaction services including Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services. As a company, going forward we plan to focus on growing customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction, which we define as Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services revenue divided by the number of customer transactions during the relevant period, excluding those customer transactions and revenue attributable to Zillow Offers. We believe excluding transactions and revenue attributable to Zillow Offers enables management and investors to better understand and monitor the health and performance of Zillow Group’s continuing transaction-based lines of business while controlling for impacts from Zillow Offers. For purposes of calculating revenue per customer transaction, a “customer transaction” includes each unique purchase or sale transaction in which the home buyer or seller uses Zillow Home Loans, Zillow Closing Services and/or involves a Premier Agent that they connected with through Zillow Group. We expect to provide additional information about customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction in future periods as it becomes relevant to investors and others’ assessment of our financial condition and results of operations following the wind down of Zillow Offers. This focus allows us to build closer relationships with our customers to help them find and move into the places they call home, which is at the core of our mission. As we move forward, we plan to continue to build on the strong foundation of our established real estate marketplaces as we strive to grow customer transactions and revenue per transaction.
We have organized our business into three segments, the Homes segment, the Internet, Media & Technology (“IMT”) segment and the Mortgages segment. These segments reflect the way we evaluate business performance and manage our operations. The Homes segment includes the financial results from our purchase and sale of homes directly through Zillow Offers and the financial results from the title and escrow services provided through Zillow Closing Services. On November 2, 2021, we made the determination to wind down Zillow Offers operations within the Homes segment. As a result of this decision, we plan to report Zillow Offers as a discontinued operation beginning with the period during which disposition of the business is complete. The IMT segment includes the financial results for the Premier Agent, rentals and new construction marketplaces, dotloop, ShowingTime, display and other advertising and business software solutions. The Mortgages segment

primarily includes financial results for mortgage originations through Zillow Home Loans and advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals.
Customer Offerings
To deliver on our mission, we strive to provide a seamless, integrated transaction experience for movers through Zillow, our network of trusted partners, and affiliated brands. We do this through a range of services designed to help our customers in whatever stage(s) of home they may be in. This typically includes the need for multiple services simultaneously. According to the Zillow Group 2021 Consumer Housing Trends Report, nearly two-thirds of sellers are also buying at the same time, and among renters with plans to move within the next year, two in five plan to buy their next home.
Our services are primarily designed for the following:
For Buyers and Sellers – When a buyer or seller is ready to meet with a local real estate professional after searching for a home on our mobile applications and websites, we connect them with a Premier Agent partner. For customers who are focused on buying new construction homes, we connect them with our home builder partners. Our customers can also facilitate a seamless transaction with financing through Zillow Home Loans and adjacent title and escrow services through Zillow Closing Services. 
For Renters – Over 32% more households move to a new rental than homes are sold in the U.S. annually, (over 9.2 million leases executed, according to the 2020 American Community Survey versus 6.9 million homes sold, derived of 6.1 million existing homes sold and 763 thousand new homes sold, according to 2021 economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), and we connect prospective renters with our property management and landlord partners in the Zillow Rental Network, which provides renters access to the largest collection of rental properties in the U.S., according to a 2021 Comscore Media Metrix® report. We also provide renters with the ability to easily submit applications, sign leases and make rental payments through our platform. 
For Borrowers – According to the March 2021 National Association of REALTORS® “2021 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends Report,” approximately 87% of homes purchased in the U.S. are financed with mortgage debt. We provide our customers with multiple ways to pursue mortgage financing for their transaction. We provide customers with the option to finance directly with Zillow Home Loans or to connect with our mortgage partners through our mortgage marketplace for both purchase and refinance opportunities. Zillow Home Loans, which is currently available in 46 states and jurisdictions, originates mortgage loans and then sells the loans on the secondary market. 
Competitive Advantages
We believe we have the following competitive advantages:
•Large and trusted brand. The Zillow Group portfolio attracted an annual monthly high of 234 million unique users in July 2021 and more than 10.2 billion visits in 2021. Our master brand “Zillow” is searched more often than “real estate,” according to a 2021 Google Trends report, and has become the most trusted brand in the online real estate industry, according to the Comscore Media Metrix® . Our large and engaged audience and brand trust keeps our customer acquisition costs low.
•Living database of homes and superior data science and technology advantages. Our living database of more than 135 million U.S. homes is the result of substantial investment, sophisticated economic and statistical analysis and complex data aggregation of multiple sources of property, transaction and listing data, including user updates to more than 38 million property records. This data is the foundation of our proprietary Zestimate, Rent Zestimate, Zestimate Forecast and Zillow Home Value Index. In 2021, we launched significant upgrades to our Zestimate home valuation model. The changes allowed the Zestimate algorithm to react more quickly to current market trends and improved the national median error rate of 2.65% for homes listed for sale and 7.26% for off-market homes. The algorithm now leverages neural networks, the latest machine learning approach, and incorporates deeper history of property data such as sales transactions, tax assessments and public records, in addition to home details such as square footage and location. In 2021, Zillow also became a licensed brokerage, giving us access to higher-quality, real-time data from multiple listing services (“MLSs”) around the U.S. via a significantly lower number of data feeds.

•Superior industry partnerships. Zillow Group partners with thousands of the most productive names in real estate, maintaining strong partnerships with leading real estate agents, brokers, mortgage professionals, property managers, landlords, home builders, regional MLSs and more. Our partnership with the MLSs was enhanced in 2021 when Zillow became a licensed brokerage entity. As we focus on real estate transaction-related services, we work to partner with high-performing and service-focused industry partners who share our interests in providing the best-possible services to our shared customers.
•Engaged customers. Zillow is the leader in online residential real estate in the United States today, with the largest brand awareness and audience and the highest level of customer trust, and is uniquely positioned to address customer needs. With an annual average of approximately 200 million average monthly unique users, successful Premier Agent network and integrated residential housing and rental platform, Zillow is number one in brand awareness and audience trust. Of the estimated 6.1 million home buyers each year we estimate that approximately 4.1 million shopped using Zillow.
•Experienced, Proven Management Team. We have a highly experienced management team who have successfully built Zillow and other brands into category leaders. We have added executive talent with deep experience in building transaction-focused real estate, mortgage and e-commerce businesses as well as sophisticated capital market financing. The skills and experiences of our management team provide strategic insights and abilities to deliver a seamless real estate transaction experience for our customers.
•Strong Culture of Innovation and Inclusion. Zillow Group has built an award-winning culture of collaboration and innovation that is committed to employee equity and creating an environment where employees feel valued, supported and that they belong. Zillow Group has been recognized for our commitment to these efforts, being named on the “Corporate Equality Index 2021” with a score of 100 and “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Additionally, in 2021, Zillow Group was named one of the Best Workplaces in the technology industry for Millennials, for Parents, for Women, in the Bay Area and in New York by Great Place to Work®. Zillow Group was also named one of the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2021 and was included on Bloomberg’s “2021 Gender Equality Index”.
•Solid Financial Position. Zillow has a flexible balance sheet and a large and growing IMT business that generates substantial cash flow to help finance the expansion of our transaction-related businesses. We also have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our investments.
Total Addressable Market
We participate in large addressable markets of buying, selling, renting and financing residential real estate in the U.S. As we continue to move towards a transactional model focused on helping customers move, we estimate our TAM has expanded from $19 billion in U.S. residential real estate related advertising in 2019 (according to a Borrell Association report) to nearly $300 billion. Our TAM includes Zillow’s estimate of over $100 billion in referral fees derived from participating in real estate transactions with our partners (based on the 2021 National Association of REALTORS® U.S. Economic Outlook published in November 2021). In addition, we provide important adjacent services, including mortgages through Zillow Home Loans and title and escrow closing services through Zillow Closing Services. U.S. mortgage origination revenue represents a $155 billion annual opportunity (according to a 2021 Mortgage Bankers Association Report), while title and escrow represents a combined $26 billion annual opportunity (according to an American Land and Title press release dated April 7, 2021 and a report by Doma Holdings, Inc. published in May 2021). 
With nearly half of all people looking to buy also considering renting (according to the Zillow Group 2021 Consumer Housing Trends Report), our TAM also includes our complementary rentals marketplace which we estimate participates in nearly $11 billion of estimated annual rentals advertising spend. We also participate in the nearly $5.0 billion annual property management software industry (according to a May 2021 report published by Fortune Business Insights). Our rentals marketplace assists our partners with listings, advertising and leasing services in a market of nearly 47 million rental units in the U.S. (according to the 2021 U.S. Census’ Current Population Survey).
We also may explore additional opportunities in the future, including but not limited to home insurance ($119 billion TAM according to an IBISWorld report published in August 2021), home renovation services ($595 billion TAM according to a 2021 report published by Angi Inc.), moving services (nearly $18 billion TAM according to an IBISWorld report published in September 2021) and home appraisal services (over $9 billion TAM according to IBIS World in May 2021). The amounts listed represent the estimated total industry size associated with these opportunities.

Seasonality
Portions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. Traffic to our mobile applications and websites has historically peaked during the spring and summer months, consistent with peak residential real estate activity. For further discussion on seasonality, see our Quarterly Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Our business depends on our ability to successfully attract, retain and provide customers with products and services that make real estate transactions faster, easier and less stressful. 
The residential real estate landscape is highly fragmented and competitive from the beginning of the search process through the closing of a transaction, typically with single point service providers and new entrants joining at a rapid pace. According to the Federal Reserve Economic Data, 6.9 million existing and new homes were sold in the U.S. in 2021, with over 202 thousand real estate brokerages (according to the National Association of REALTORS®) and over 57 thousand mortgage lenders (according to the 2021 Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System Industry Report) providing their services across the 597 different Multiple Listing Services that span the country (according to the Real Estate Standards Organization in 2021). Zillow Home Loans currently makes up less than 0.1% of the mortgages originated in the U.S. 
We compete for customers with companies that provide technology, products, and services for real estate focused customers. Factors that may influence customer decisions include the quality of the experience, value and utility of the services offered, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information available, and brand awareness and reputation. For example, our Premier Agent business competes for customers based on price, visibility and level of service provided by companies selling online advertising in the real estate industry. For customers shopping for a mortgage, Zillow Home Loans competes with other mortgage originators based on a combination of interest rates, origination fees, product selection and the level of service we provide.
In addition, our business depends on our ability to attract and retain leading industry partners to advertise and provide services to our customer base. We compete for real estate partners based on the perceived transaction readiness of customers, return on investment, price and product offerings and the effectiveness and relevance of our products and services. Based on these and other factors, real estate partners could select other companies dedicated to providing real estate, rental, new construction and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals, local brokerage sites and major internet portals, general search engines, e-commerce and social media sites. We also compete for a share of our partners’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media as well as word-of-mouth referrals and leads from yard signs and other marketing. 
Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property as a key differentiator that is critical to our success and rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade-secret protection, and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary technology and data. 
Our Zestimate, which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage with respect to customer engagement, leverages patented, proprietary, automated valuation models to provide real-time home value estimates. As of December 31, 2021, we have 62 patents of varying lengths issued and 109 patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally. These patents cover a variety of proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services, including determining a current value for real estate property and the collection, storage and display of home attribute values and creating Zillow 3D home tours and floor plans. 
In addition, awareness and loyalty to our brand enables us to effectively attract and retain our customers. To support our brand, we have registered, or applied for the registration of, trademarks, service marks and copyrights in the U.S. and several other jurisdictions, including “Zillow,” “Zestimate,” and the Z in a house logo. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names. We have licensed in the past, and we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
To further protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. We control the use of our proprietary technology, data and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use and other restrictions on our mobile applications and websites.

Government Regulation
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are affected by a continually expanding and evolving range of local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations. For additional information on government regulation refer to Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
At Zillow, we believe that our long-term success is dependent upon attracting, developing and retaining talented employees, and maintaining a culture that allows each employee to do their best work. We value integrity, accountability, collaboration, creativity, respect and transparency as central to our core values.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 8,005 full-time employees. Our internal data shows that 51% of our workforce self-identified as men and 49% self-identified as women, with women representing 37% of our leadership team (defined as director level and above). The ethnicity of our workforce was 59% White, 18% Asian, 9% LatinX, 9% Black and 4% for all other races. For leadership, the breakdown was 74% White, 15% Asian, 5% Black, 3% LatinX and 3% for all other races. The diversity of our workforce and leadership team continues to be an area of focus. 
In connection with the wind down of Zillow Offers operations announced on November 2, 2021, we expect to reduce our workforce by approximately 25%, which reductions will primarily go into effect during the first half of 2022. 
Zillow as a Flexible Workforce    
Our focus on employees throughout 2021 has been critically important in light of the unique challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are redefining the employee experience and the future of flexible work, beginning with our announcement of a permanent move to a flexible workforce in late 2020. In addition, we updated our compensation philosophy to view our roles competitively nationally and not just locally, connecting to our flexible work philosophy of employees being able to work from anywhere. In 2021, to better align with Zillow’s movement to a flexible workforce, we updated our base pay compensation frameworks to prioritize performance over geographic location when making pay decisions. As we have transitioned to a flexible workforce, we are also using this opportunity to diversify our workforce, as we are no longer bound by the geographic limits of our physical workspaces. 
We expect that our offices will continue to be a place for teams to come together to enable productivity and collaboration, though on a far less frequent basis. In 2021, we redesigned our physical workspaces to provide more space for collaboration and engagement, especially to support team gatherings.
We are also restructuring our flexible work model to more effectively use our time together, provide more opportunities to work asynchronously, and allow all employees to thrive regardless of location. By implementing company-wide core collaboration hours and flexible working hours to enable employees to build their work life around their home life, we are resetting the expectation of availability and providing greater flexibility in how we work. In 2022, our focus will be on developing additional working norms that increase productivity while also supporting mental and physical health.
Equity and Belonging
We are committed to creating a workplace where diversity of gender, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, military status and religion are represented, embraced and respected. Our dedicated Equity and Belonging team empowers Zillow employees to build a strong community, amplify underrepresented voices, and foster a company culture where everyone can learn, grow and thrive. We maintain equity and belonging programs that include unconscious bias training, nine employee-led affinity networks for community members and allies, and support diversity in our recruitment practices and inclusive job descriptions.
Pay Equity
Zillow Group is committed to ensuring all employees in similar roles with similar qualifications are paid equitably regardless of their identity. In support of this commitment, we complete a comprehensive annual evaluation with the commitment to disclose results publicly on our corporate website. Based on our assessment of compensation in 2021, we have found that women and men with similar skills are paid within approximately 1% of each other when we control for job title, function and location. In 2021, White women, Black men and LatinX men at Zillow Group had controlled pay of $0.99 and 
Table of Contents

Black and LatinX women had controlled pay of $0.98. Asian women and men at Zillow Group had pay equity of $1.01 and $1.02, respectively. 
While intersectionality of gender and ethnicity in our pay equity data is something we began assessing in 2020 and progress has been shown, we cannot ignore the disparities and recognize our work is far from over. We will continue our commitment and comprehensive reviews of pay equity and will look to expand our data collection and analysis to include LGBTQ+ data in the future. We were included in the 2021 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, which measures equality across internal company statistics, employee policies and practices and external community support and engagement.
Career and Leadership Development 
At Zillow Group, we believe each of our employees should have the tools and support they need to grow their careers through experiences, resources and connections. We have a dedicated Talent Success team, which creates educational resources and conducts training on a wide range of topics including job-specific onboarding, effective communication, collaboration, as well as sophisticated leadership training programs and experiences with focused learning tracks for both new managers and experienced leaders. In 2021, we offered over 1,100 online learning opportunities through Zillow University. Zillow Group employees have completed nearly 92,000 hours of content in the past year on Zillow University and LinkedIn Learning.
A key piece in development is cultivating a learning culture where learning is a habit, and learning agility is at the forefront. This means creating the right learning resources for our employees for their current and future roles. We have developed a robust Learning & Development portfolio that includes a number of key career development programs that support our employees to equip them with the knowledge and experience to grow their careers. Below is a summary of certain of these programs:
•Leadership Entrance Experience Program (LEEP) is designed for individual contributors who want to explore people management and develop their leadership skills. 
•Career Pathways Program provides employees with access to skills, connections and experiences aimed at creating development opportunities through cross-functional roles. 
•Professional skills development through courses like Crucial Conversations, Insights Discovery® workshops, and access to virtual coaching. 
Our people managers play a critical role in moving our business forward by coaching their team, developing their talent and providing strong communication to create team engagement. To help achieve this goal, we utilize our Leadership Blueprint, a leadership development guide that outlines our Leadership Philosophy, our expectations for leaders and the behaviors that are essential to create a consistent leadership experience at Zillow Group. The Blueprint provides the foundation of our leadership development programs. Twice a year, employees are given the opportunity to provide valuable information about how their manager is demonstrating our Leadership Expectations and the feedback provided is incorporated into their manager’s overall performance evaluation for the year. 
In 2021, we launched programming for Zillow Group women executives, which aims to build better relationships and connections and provide additional professional and leadership development. To ensure an even smoother transition from Senior Director roles to Vice President, we are now providing new executives with additional support, including an executive coach and access to senior executive leadership roundtable discussions. Externally hired executives are also provided with extra tools and support to ensure their success. We are working to instill strong, consistent leadership that will lead us into the workplace of the future.
Total Rewards
Zillow’s competitive, market-based compensation program focuses on pay-for-performance, instilling ownership by utilizing a broad-based equity approach. In 2021, we continued to refine our rewards program in support of a flexible workforce, launching new base pay frameworks which mitigated pay impacts to employees choosing to move locations within a given country. In addition, our robust benefits are reflected in investments in physical, family, mental and financial wellness programs to meet the needs of our diverse base of employees. These benefits include remote workplace flexibility, competitive health care coverage, fully paid maternity and paternity leave, a sabbatical program, wellness reimbursements, tuition support and COVID-19 caregiver resources.
