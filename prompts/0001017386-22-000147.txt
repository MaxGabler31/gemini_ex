Item 1. Description of Business
GENERAL 
 
Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas; the rental of oilfield equipment; and through one of its subsidiaries, the gathering and marketing of natural gas. The terms the "Company", "We", "Us" or “Spindletop” are used interchangeably herein to refer to Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. (“Spindletop”, “SOG”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Spindletop Drilling Company ("SDC"), and Prairie Pipeline Co. (“PPC”).
 
The Company has focused its oil and gas operations principally in Texas, although we operate properties in six states including: Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas. We operate a majority of our projects through the drilling and production phases. Our staff has numerous years of experience in the operations area. We have traditionally leveraged the risks associated with drilling by obtaining industry partners to share in the costs.
 
In addition, the Company, through PPC, owns several miles of pipelines associated with Company operated oil and natural gas properties in Texas which are used for the gathering of natural gas. These gathering lines are located primarily in the Fort Worth Basin and are being utilized to transport the Company's natural gas as well as natural gas.

Information on our website is not a part of this report.
Operating Approach
 
We believe that a major attribute of the Company is its long history with, and extensive knowledge of, the Fort Worth Basin of Texas. Our technical staff has extensive oil and gas experience in the Fort Worth Basin, and other geological basins in which the Company has operations.
 
One of our strengths has been the ability of the Company to look at cost effective ways to grow our production. We have traditionally increased our reserve base in one of two ways. Initially, in the 1970s and 1980s, the Company obtained its production through an exploration and development drilling program focused principally in the Fort Worth Basin of North Texas. Today, the Company has retained many of these wells as producing properties and holds a large amount of acreage by production in that Basin.
 
From the 1990s through 2003, the Company took advantage of the lower product prices by cost effectively adding to its reserve base through value-priced acquisitions. We found that through selective purchases we could make producing property acquisitions that were more cost effective than drilling.
 
During this time period, the Company acquired a large number of operated and non-operated oil and gas properties in various states.
 
From 2003 through 2008, we returned our focus to a strategy of development drilling with an emphasis on our Barnett Shale acreage. Since 2009, the Company’s focus has evolved to seek value-priced acquisitions combined with the development of economically feasible drilling prospects. Currently we are continuing our efforts to acquire producing properties, develop our leasehold acreage, and acquire selective additional leasehold acreage for development purposes. We are pursuing growth primarily through acquisitions of good quality producing properties, participating in drilling projects with other operators, and selective drilling and recompletion activities. Post Covid demand for oil and natural gas products along with boycotts of oil and natural gas from other countries have caused dramatic increases in the prices of oil and natural gas recently. Supply chain shortages along with labor shortages have caused rapidly rising costs for the Company to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. We believe that it is prudent to carefully evaluate all our options and consider whether each transaction can be supported in today’s price environment.

Strategic Business Plans
 
One of our key strategies is to attempt to maintain shareholder value through implementation of plans for selective drilling projects and value priced acquisitions to the extent the economics of such projects work in the current environment. The Company's long-term focus is to grow its oil and natural gas production through a strategic combination of selected property acquisitions, divestitures, participating in drilling projects with other operators, and a development program primarily based on developing its leasehold acreage. Additionally, the Company plans to continue to rework existing wells to increase production and reserves when feasible.
 
The Company's primary area of operation has been in the State of Texas. We plan to continue to focus on operations in Texas, and we want to capitalize on our strengths which include an extensive knowledge of the various reservoirs in Texas, experience in operations in this geographic area, development of lease holdings, and utilization of existing infrastructure to minimize costs.
 
The Company will continue to generate and evaluate prospects using its own technical staff and outside consultants. The Company intends to fund operations primarily from cash flow generated by its operations.
 
On July 26, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to attempt to enhance shareholder value. The strategic alternatives being considered include a possible sale of all or a material portion of assets, either in one transaction or a series of transactions, a merger of the Company or other form of business combination involving the Company and a third party, the purchase of additional assets, the outright sale of the Company, or recapitalization of the Company.
 
No definitive timeline exists for the process, and there can be no assurance that the results of the review process will result in a transaction or other change. It is not expected that there will be further disclosure of developments in the review process unless and until the Board of Directors has approved the specific course of action or has otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required.
 
Areas of Operations
 
The Company owns various interests in wells located in numerous states and the Company’s operations are currently located in 6 of those states which include Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas.
 
The Company holds approximately 76,785 gross acres under lease in the states listed below. The majority of the leases are held by production. A breakout of the Company’s leasehold acreage by geographic area is as follows:

North Texas - Fort Worth Basin & Bend Arch
 
The Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province has been a focal point of the Company since its inception. Our technical personnel have numerous years of exploration, drilling, completing, and production experience extracting natural gas and oil from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon deposits found across the basin. Furthermore, the Company maintains comprehensive and extensive dossiers of geologic and engineering data gathered from the province.
 
The Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province is a major United States onshore natural gas-prone expanse containing multiple pay zones that range in depth from one thousand to nine thousand (1,000-9,000) feet. Improved technical advances in fracturing and stimulation technologies have helped unlock natural gas and oil reserves from the hydrocarbon bearing Barnett Shale Formation; and thus, continue to bolster vigorous exploration and development activities that target these conventional and unconventional reservoir reserves throughout the province.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
 
The Company’s net proved oil and natural gas reserves have been estimated by Company personnel. (See applicable footnote to the financial statements). No separate independent reserve report analysis has been prepared by an independent third party.
 
The net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of the Company as of December 31, 2021, based on SEC guidelines, were classified as follows:
 

 | Barrels of Oil | | BCF Gas
-------------------------------+----------------+---------+--------
Proved Developed Producing | | 186,690 | | 5.184
Proved Developed Non-Producing | | — | | — 
Proved Undeveloped | | — | | — 
Total Proved Reserves | | 186,690 | | 5,184

 


Only reserves that fell within the Proved classification were considered. Other categories such as Probable or Possible Reserves were not considered. No value was given to the potential future development of behind pipe reserves, untested fault blocks, or the potential for deeper reservoirs underlying the Company's properties. Shut-in, uneconomic wells, and insignificant non-operated interests were excluded.
 
On a BOE (barrel of oil equivalent) basis (6 MCF/BOE), the net reserves are:
 


 | Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) | 
-------------------------------+---------------------------------+----------
Natural Gas Reserves | | 863,955 | 82 | %
Oil Reserves | | 186,690 | 18 | %
Total Reserves | | 1,050,645 | 100 | %
Proved Developed Producing | | 1,050,645 | 100 | %
Proved Developed Non-Producing | | — | 0 | %
Proved Undeveloped | | — | 0 | %
Total Proved Reserves | | 1,050,645 | 100 | %

The Company has operational control over the majority of these reserves and can therefore to a large extent control the timing of development and production.
 

 | Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) | 
-------------------+---------------------------------+----------
Operated Wells | | 840,398 | 80 | %
Non-Operated Wells | | 210,247 | 20 | %
Total | | 1,050,645 | 100 | %

Financial Information Relating to Industry Segments
 
The Company has three identifiable business segments: (1) exploration, acquisition, development and production of oil and natural gas, (2) natural gas gathering, and (3) commercial real estate investment. Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed herein sets forth the relevant information regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets for these segments.
Narrative Description of Business
 
The Company is engaged in the exploration, development, acquisition and production of oil and natural gas, and the gathering and marketing of natural gas. The Company is also engaged in commercial real estate leasing through leasing office space to non-related third-party tenants in the Company’s corporate headquarters office building.
Principal Products, Distribution and Availability
 
The principal products marketed by the Company are crude oil and natural gas which are sold to major oil and gas companies, brokers, pipelines, and distributors. Reserves of oil and natural gas are depleted upon extraction. The Company is always seeking to replace its oil and gas reserves.
 
The Company is also engaged in the gathering and marketing of natural gas through its subsidiary PPC, which owns several miles of pipeline in Texas. Natural gas is gathered for a fee. Substantially all the natural gas gathered by the Company is produced from wells that the Company operates and in which it owns a working interest.
 
The Company owns land and a two-story commercial office building in Dallas, Texas, which it uses as its principal headquarters office. The Company leases the remainder of the building to non-related third-party commercial tenants at prevailing market rates.
 
Patents, Licenses and Franchises
 
Oil and natural gas leases of the Company are obtained from the owner of the mineral estate. The leases are generally for a primary term of one or more years, and often have extension options for an equivalent period as the original primary term for payment of additional bonus consideration. The leases customarily provide for extension beyond their primary term for as long as oil and natural gas are produced in commercial quantities or other operations are conducted on such leases as provided by the terms of the leases.
 
The Company currently holds interests in producing and non-producing oil and natural gas leases. The existence of the oil and natural gas leases and the terms of the oil and natural gas leases are important to the business of the Company because future additions to reserves will come from oil and natural gas leases currently owned by the Company, and others that may be acquired, when they are proven to be productive. The Company is continuing to purchase oil and natural gas leases in areas where it currently has production, and also in other areas.
 
The following is a summary of a partial list of purchasers / operators (listed by percent of total oil and natural gas sales) from oil and natural gas produced by the Company for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021.

Prospective Drilling Activities
 
The Company's primary oil and natural gas prospect generation and acquisition efforts have been in known producing areas in the United States with emphasis devoted to Texas.
 
The Company intends to use a portion of its available funds to participate in operated and non-operated drilling activities. The Company does not own any drilling rigs. Independent drilling contractors perform all drilling activity. The Company does not refine or otherwise process its oil and natural gas production.
 
Exploration for oil and natural gas is normally conducted with the Company acquiring undeveloped oil and natural gas leases under prospects and carrying out exploratory drilling on the prospective leasehold with the Company retaining a majority interest in the prospect. The Company may sell interests to third parties, with the Company retaining an overriding royalty interest, carried working interest, or a reversionary interest.
 
A prospect is a geographical area designated by the Company for the purpose of searching for oil and natural gas reserves and reasonably expected by it to contain at least one oil or natural gas reservoir. The Company utilizes its own funds along with the issuance of common stock and options to purchase common stock in some limited cases, to acquire oil and gas leases covering the lands comprising the prospects. These leases are selected by the Company and are obtained directly from the landowners, as well as from landmen, geologists, other oil companies, some of whom may be affiliated with the Company, and by direct purchase, farm-in, or option agreements. After an initial test well is drilled on a property, any subsequent development drilling of such prospect will normally require the Company to fund the development activities.
 
Employees and Independent Contractors


As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed or contracted for the services of a total of approximately 37 people. Of this total, 12 are full-time employees, and the remainder are part-time employees or independent contractors. We believe that our relationships with our employees and contractors are good.
 
In order to effectively utilize our resources, we employ the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform a variety of professional, technical, and field services, including in the areas of lease acquisition, land related documentation and contracts, drilling and completion work, pumping, inspection, testing, maintenance and specialized services. We believe that it can be more cost effective to utilize the services of consultants and independent contractors for some of these services.
 
We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel and officers, and the loss of any these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The Company does not maintain key-man life insurance policies on its employees.
 
Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
 
All of the Company's business is conducted domestically, with no export sales.

Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 
Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to numerous United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent.

"Productive Wells" or "Producing Wells" consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells waiting on pipeline connections.
 
"Proved Developed Reserves" means reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and natural gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery will be included as "proved developed reserves" only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved.

"Proved Reserves" means the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which upon analysis of geological and engineering data appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions.
 
(i) Reservoirs are considered proved if either actual production or conclusive formation
 tests support economic producability. The area of a reservoir considered proved
 includes (A) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water
 contacts, if any; and (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which
 can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological
 and engineering data. In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known
 structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.
 

(ii) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery
 techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the "proved" classification when successful
 testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides
 support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.
 
(iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (A) oil that may become
 available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as "indicated additional reserves";
 (B) crude oil and natural gas, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of
 uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics or economic factors; (C) crude oil and
 natural gas that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil and natural gas that may
 be recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such resources.
 
"Proved Undeveloped Reserves" means reserves that are recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
 
"Recompletion" means the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed.
 
"Reserves" means proved reserves.
 
"Reservoir" means a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
 
"Royalty" means an interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner's royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
 
“TCF” means trillion cubic feet.
 
“TD” means total depth.
 
“TVD” means true vertical depth,
 
"2-D Seismic" means an advanced technology method by which a cross-section of the earth's subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile.
 
13




"3-D Seismic" means an advanced technology method by which a three-dimensional image of the earth's subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do conventional surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, development, and production.
 
"Working Interest" means an interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. The share of production to which a working interest owner is entitled will always be smaller than the share of costs that the working interest owner is required to bear, with the balance of the production accruing to the owners of royalties.
 
"Workover" means operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
