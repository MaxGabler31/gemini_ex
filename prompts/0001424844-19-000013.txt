Item 1.   Business.
The Company is an Iowa limited liability company located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, formed in March, 2005. The Company is permitted to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol.  We began producing ethanol in February, 2009 and sell our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil in the United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.  
Our production facility (the “Facility”) is located in Pottawattamie County in southwestern Iowa, south of Council Bluffs. It is near two major interstate highways, I-29 and I-80, within a mile of the Missouri River and has access to five major rail carriers. This location is in close proximity to a significant amount of corn and has convenient product market access. The Facility receives corn and chemical deliveries primarily by truck and is able to utilize rail delivery if necessary.  Finished products are shipped by 
rail and truck.  The site has access to water from ground wells and from the Missouri River.  Additionally, in close proximity to the Facility’s primary energy source (steam), there are two natural gas providers available, both with infrastructure immediately accessible to the Facility.
Financial Information
Please refer to “Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities, and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data.
Rail Access
We own a six mile loop railroad track for rail service to our Facility, which accommodates several unit trains.  We are party to an Industrial Track Agreement with CBEC Railway, Inc. (the “Track Agreement “), which governs our use of the loop railroad and requires, among other things, that we maintain the loop track.
On March 24, 2019 the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Railcar Lease Agreement (“Railcar Agreement”) with Bunge North America, Inc. (“Bunge”), a related party, for the lease of 323 ethanol cars and 111 hopper cars which are used for the delivery and marketing of our ethanol and distillers grains.  Under the Railcar Agreement, the original DOT111 tank cars are leased over a four year term from March 24, 2019 to April 30, 2023, with the ability to start returning cars after January 1, 2023 to conform to the requirement for DOT117 tank cars with enhanced safety specifications which is scheduled to be effective in May 2023. The 111 hopper cars are leased over a three year term running from March 24, 2019 to March 31, 2022 which term will continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. The amendments to the Railcar Agreement lowered the cost for the leases by approximately 25% as compared to the prior lease terms. Pursuant to the terms of a side letter to the Railcar Agreement, we sublease cars back to Bunge from time to time when the cars are not in use in our operations. We work with Bunge to determine the most economic use of the available ethanol and hopper cars in light of current market conditions. In June 2017, we also entered into a second 36 month lease for an additional 30 non-insulated tank cars from an unrelated third party leasing company (this was in addition to the 30 non-insulated tank cars leased from that company signed December 2015).
Employees
We had 62 full time employees, as of September 30, 2019.  We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  Our management considers our employee relationships to be favorable.
Principal Products
The principal products we produce are ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, and carbon dioxide ("CO2").
Ethanol

Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute.  More than 99% of all ethanol produced in the United States is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products.  The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline marketers or blenders.  Ethanol is shipped by truck in the local markets, and by rail in the regional, national and international markets.
We produced 129.3 million and 127.9 million gallons of ethanol for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 ("Fiscal 2019") and September 30, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”), respectively, and approximately 75.4% and 77.9% of our revenue was derived from the sale of ethanol in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. 
Distillers Grain
 The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed marketed primarily to the beef and dairy industries.  Distillers grains contain by-pass protein that is superior to other protein supplements such as cottonseed meal and soybean meal.  We produce two forms of distillers grains: wet distillers grains with solubles (“WDGS”) and dried distillers grains with solubles (“DDGS”).  WDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% to 65% moisture.  WDGS have a shelf life of approximately seven days and are sold to local markets.  DDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has a longer shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market.
In Fiscal 2019, we sold 0.6% more tons of distillers grains compared to Fiscal 2018. Approximately 19.0% and 17.2% of our revenue was derived from the sale of distillers grains in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.
Syrup sales constitute 0.2% of our revenue in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 , respectively.
Corn Oil

Our system separates corn oil from the post-fermentation syrup stream as it leaves the evaporators of the ethanol plant. The corn oil is then routed to storage tanks, and the remaining concentrated syrup is routed to the plant’s syrup tank. Corn oil can be marketed as either a feed additive or a biodiesel feedstock.  We sold 10.8% more tons of corn oil in Fiscal 2019 than in Fiscal 2018, with approximately 5.1% and 4.4% of our revenue generated from corn oil sales, respectively.
Carbon Dioxide
In April 2013, we entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “CO2 Agreement”) with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., formerly known as EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. ("Air Products") under which we agreed to supply, and Air Products agreed to purchase, a portion of raw CO2 gas produced by our Facility. In addition, we entered into a Non-Exclusive CO2 Facility Site Lease Agreement under which we granted Air Products a non-exclusive right of entry and license to construct, maintain and operate a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant (the “CO2 Plant”) on a site near our Facility. The term of the CO2 Agreement runs for ten (10) years from the startup of the CO2 Plant (the “Initial Term”) and then renews automatically for two (2) additional five (5) year periods thereafter, unless written notice of termination is submitted within six (6) months prior to the end of the then current term.
Air Products pays us a base price per ton, which acts as a floor price, Air Products will pay us an additional amount based on Air Products profits above a minimum targeted margin. The CO2 Agreement also contains a take or pay obligation pursuant to which Air Products agrees to pay us for a minimum number of tons each year. CO2 was 0.3% of our revenue in both years for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018.
Principal Product Markets
As described below in “Distribution Methods,” we market and distribute all of our ethanol and distillers grains through Bunge.  Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We expect Bunge to explore all markets for our ethanol and distillers grains, including export markets, and believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the "EIA"), in the first seven months of 2019, ethanol exports decreased 16% as compared to the first seven months of 2018. Although Brazil continues to import the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States, tariffs implemented by Brazil on U.S. ethanol imports have significantly reduced Brazilian demand. Canada represents the second largest export destination for U.S. ethanol with India in third place. Exports of U.S. ethanol to these three countries constitute almost 60% of all U.S. ethanol exports. South Korea and the Philippines represent the remaining countries in the top 5 for destinations for U.S. ethanol exports in the first seven months of 2019. 
Although Brazil remained the largest export destination for U.S. ethanol, Brazilian demand fell from 32% of domestic ethanol exports in 2018 to 26% in 2019. Ethanol exports to Brazil continue to be impacted by the 20% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter, imposed in September 2017 by Brazil’s Chamber of Foreign Trade (CAMEX). A rise in crude oil prices and the domestic price of high gasoline blends in Brazil has made ethanol importation economic even after paying the tariff. It remains to be seen if Brazil’s CAMEX will raise tariffs further in response, especially as new corn ethanol plants come on line in Brazil.
Similar to Brazil, tariffs implemented by China on U.S. ethanol has essentially eliminated China as an export market for U.S. ethanol. China was included in the top export markets during the first half of 2018; however, approximately 99% of the exports to China occurred in the first three months of 2018 and since then, U.S. ethanol exports to China have been reduced to zero due to increased tariffs. There is also potential for the imposition of tariffs by other countries in addition to Brazil and China due to trade disputes with the United States which could reduce the overall export demand and therefore could have a negative impact on ethanol prices. On December 13, 2019, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to the first phase of a trade deal (the "Phase One Agreement")where China agreed to purchase billions of dollars in agricultural products in exchange for the U.S. agreeing not to pursue a new round of tariffs starting January 2020. The impact on the ethanol market cannot be determined at this time.
 Ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand, and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For instance, a strong U.S. Dollar is an example of a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. In addition, the Chinese and Brazil tariffs have had, and likely will continue to have, a negative impact on the export market demand and prices for ethanol produced in the United States.
Distillers grains have become more accepted as animal feed throughout the world and therefore, distillers grains exports have increased and may continue to increase as worldwide acceptance grows. However, according to the U.S. Grains Council (the "USGC"), U.S. distillers grains annual exports through August 31, 2019 were approximately 7% lower than distillers grains exports for the same nine-month period last year with Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Canada accounting for 56% of total U.S. distillers grains export volumes.
Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China; however, exports to China have significantly decreased as a result of the Chinese antidumping and countervailing investigations and the implementation of significant duties on importing into China distillers grains produced in the United States. The imposition of these duties resulted in materially decreased demand from China requiring U.S. producers to seek out alternative export markets, including Mexico, Canada and Vietnam. In 2017, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnam lifted the suspension which blocked imports of U.S. dried distiller’s grains which had been in place since December 2016. As a result, Vietnam became the fourth largest U.S. market export in the twelve month period ending August 2018 and was the third largest importer of U.S. DDGS in the first 8 months of 2019. The lift of this suspension resulted in increased exports to Vietnam; however, there is no guarantee that the Vietnamese export market will sustain this growth. In addition, recent trade disputes with other countries have created additional uncertainty as to future export demand for U.S. distillers grains. On December 13, 2019, the U.S. and China announced the Phase One Agreement where China agreed to purchase billions of dollars in agricultural products in exchange for the U.S. agreeing not to pursue a new round of tariffs starting January 2020. The impact on the distillers grain market cannot be determined at this time.
We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users or middlemen within the domestic market. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.
We sell carbon dioxide directly to Air Products and we market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to buyers in the domestic market.
Distribution Methods
On December 5, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Ethanol Purchase Agreement with Bunge which was further amended and restated on October 23, 2017 to include specific provisions for loading and shipment of ethanol by truck (the “Ethanol Agreement”). Under the Ethanol Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell Bunge all of the ethanol produced by the Company, and Bunge has agreed to purchase the same.  The Company pays Bunge a percentage fee for ethanol sold by Bunge, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Ethanol Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, but will automatically renew for one five-year term unless terminated by the parties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
We entered into a Distillers Grain Purchase Agreement, as amended (“DG Agreement”) with Bunge, under which Bunge is obligated to purchase from us and we are obligated to sell to Bunge all distillers grains produced at our Facility.
The initial term of the DG Agreement runs until December 31, 2019, and will automatically renew for one additional five year term unless terminated by the parties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Under the DG Agreement, Bunge pays us a purchase price equal to the sales price minus the marketing fee and transportation costs.  The sales price is the price received by Bunge in a contract consistent with the DG Marketing Policy or the spot price agreed to between Bunge and the Company. Bunge receives a marketing fee consisting of a percentage of the net sales price, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. Net sales price is the sales price less the transportation costs and rail lease charges.  The transportation costs are all freight charges, fuel surcharges, and other access charges applicable to delivery of distillers grains.  Rail lease charges are the monthly lease payment for rail cars along with all administrative and tax filing fees for such leased rail cars.
 We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to buyers within the domestic market.
Raw Materials
Corn Requirements

The principal raw material necessary to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn which are affected by supply and demand factors such as crop production, carryout, exports, government policies and programs, risk management and weather.  With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers grain during times of higher corn prices. However, given that ethanol sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.
High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. During Fiscal 2019, corn prices were higher compared to Fiscal 2018 due primarily to concerns that the size of the 2019/20 crop would be negatively affected by substandard spring planting conditions resulting from wet weather and flooding in the upper Midwest. In November 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) revised their estimates for the 2019/2020 corn production to decrease its forecast to 13.7 million bushels which is down approximately 0.9% from the October forecast and 5% from 2018/2019 crop production. Based on November 1 conditions, the USDA forecasts average corn yields at 167 bushels per acre which is down slightly from the October forecast. The USDA forecast for area harvested for corn remains at 81.8 million acres which is an increase of 0.1% as compared to the prior year.
Our management expects that corn prices will continue to increase slightly through the first two quarters of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”) as a result of the lower levels of production and yield forecasted by the USDA, as well as carryover levels from the prior year. However, if corn prices rise more than expected, it will have an adverse impact on our operating margins unless the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains are able to outpace the rising corn prices. Management continually monitors corn prices and the availability of corn near the Facility and also continually attempts to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on profitability through its risk management strategies, including hedging positions taken in the corn market. 
 Our Facility needs approximately 48.3 million bushels of corn annually, to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol, or approximately 132,300 bushels per day.  During Fiscal 2019 we purchased 2.2% more corn compared to Fiscal 2018, which was obtained entirely from local markets.  The Company and Bunge are also parties to an Amended and Restated Grain Feedstock Agency Agreement (the “Agency Agreement”).  The Agency Agreement provides that Bunge will procure corn for the Company and the Company will pay Bunge a per bushel fee, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Agency Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for one additional five year term unless terminated by the parties in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 
Starting with the 2015 crop year, the Company began using corn containing Syngenta Seeds, Inc.’s proprietary Enogen® technology (“Enogen Corn”) for a portion of its ethanol production needs. The Company contracted directly with growers to produce Enogen Corn for sale to the Company. Consistent with our Agency Agreement with Bunge, we also entered into a Services Agreement with Bunge regarding corn purchases (the “ Services Agreement ”). Under this Services Agreement, we originate all Enogen Corn contracts for our Facility and Bunge assists us with certain administrative matters related to Enogen Corn, including facilitating delivery to our Facility. Fiscal year 2019 Enogen Corn deliveries constituted 12.6% of all corn deliveries, a decrease from Fiscal 2018's level of 13.4%.
Energy Requirements

The production of ethanol is an energy intensive process which uses significant amounts of electricity and steam or natural gas as a heat source.  Presently, about 23,000 MMBTUs of energy are required to produce a gallon of ethanol.  It is our goal to operate the plant as safely and profitably as possible, optimizing the amount of energy consumed per gallon of ethanol produced, balanced with the relative values of WDGS as compared to DDGS.  
In September 2019, the Company went on line with the Whitefox Integrated Cartridge Efficiency (ICE) system to push towards more efficient operations in our plant. This technology benefits the plant through energy reduction, purity flexibility and debottlenecking of the distillation and dehydration processes. Energy efficiency is expected to improve by over 1,000 BTU's per gallon of ethanol produced, which results in steam savings and carbon emission reductions. 
Steam

Unlike most ethanol producers in the United States which use natural gas as their primary energy source, we have access to steam as a one of our energy sources in addition to natural gas. Historically, we have changed between steam and natural gas 
depending on energy costs and other factors.  We believe our ability to utilize steam makes us more competitive, as under certain energy market conditions our energy costs will be lower than natural gas fired plants.  We have entered into a Steam Service Contract (“Steam Contract”) with MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAm”), under which MidAm provides us the steam required by us, up to 475,000 pounds per hour.  The Steam Contract links our net energy rates and charges for steam to certain specified energy indexes, subject to certain minimum and maximum rates, so that our steam costs remain competitive with the general energy market. The Steam Contract expires in November 2024. During Fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 20.5% more steam compared to Fiscal 2018. The increase in Fiscal 2019 was due to a contractual obligation specified in our contract with MidAm and their plant availability. The price for steam increased 11.0% in Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018. Steam availability from MidAm continues to be volatile as a result of MidAm’s increased utilization of wind energy, rather than coal, since Fiscal 2017.
Natural Gas

Although steam has traditionally been considered our primary energy source, natural gas accounted for approximately 44.8% of our energy usage in Fiscal 2019, compared to 60.5% in Fiscal 2018. The decrease in our natural gas usage was due to increased steam availability and obligations specified in our contract with MidAm. We have two natural gas boilers for use when our steam service is temporarily unavailable. Natural gas is also needed for incidental purposes.  We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Encore Energy in April of 2012 to fulfill our natural gas needs at the Gas Daily Midpoint pricing.  
Electricity

Our Facility requires a large continuous supply of electrical energy.  In Fiscal 2019 we used approximately 2.2% more electricity compared to Fiscal 2018. This was primarily due to slightly higher production levels during 2019 as compared to 2018.
Water

We require a supply of water typical for the industry for our production process.  Our primary water source comes from the underground Missouri River aquifer via our three onsite wells. The majority of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the plant.  All our ground water is treated through our onsite water oxidation system. This filtered water is used throughout our process. We do treat (polish) some of this filtered water for boiler and cooling tower make-up with our Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to minimize any elements that will harm the boiler and steam systems as permitted.  We send some of our non-process contact water back to the Missouri River.  The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation and cooling.  We also evaporate much of our water through our dryer system for dried corn distillers grains.  The rest of our process water is recycled back into the plant, which minimizes waste of our water supply.  
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
SIRE® and our SIRE® logo are registered trademarks of the Company in the United States. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this report constitute common law trademarks and/or service marks of the Company. Other parties’ marks referred to in this report are the property of their respective owners. We were granted a perpetual license by ICM, Inc. (“ICM”) to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our Facility.  There is no ongoing fee or definitive calendar term for this license.
Seasonality of Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
Risk Management and Hedging Transactions
The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers grain and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  Although we believe that our hedging 
strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.
Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers grains.
We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we have marketing and agency agreements with Bunge, for the purpose of marketing and distributing our principal products.  We rely on Bunge for the sale and distribution of the majority of our products.  Currently, we do not have the ability to market our ethanol and distillers grains internally should Bunge be unable or refuse to market these products at acceptable prices.  However, we anticipate that we would be able to very quickly secure competitive marketers should we need to replace Bunge for any reason.
Competition 
Domestic Ethanol Competitors
The ethanol we produce is similar to ethanol produced by other domestic plants.  As of November 2019, the Renewable Fuels Association ("RFA") estimated that there were 208 installed ethanol production facilities in the United States with a total capacity of 16.6 billion gallons based on nameplate capacity and seven additional plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 270 million gallons. Further, the RFA has estimated that approximately 7% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States is idled. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominately based on price. The top five producers account for almost half of domestic production. We are in direct competition with many of these top five producers as well as other national producers, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we have and each of which is producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. In addition, we believe that the ethanol industry will continue to consolidate leading to a market where a small number of large ethanol producers with substantial production capacities will control an even larger portion of the U.S. ethanol production. In recent years, the ethanol industry has also seen increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year.
We may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors and the oil companies who are capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol, have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain efficiencies and other benefits that we cannot achieve with one ethanol plant or are able to operate at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. For instance, ethanol producers that own multiple plants may be able to compete in the marketplace more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable, because they have the flexibility to run certain production facilities while reducing production or shutting down production at other facilities. These large producers may also be able to realize economies of scale which we are unable to realize or they may have better negotiating positions with purchasers.  Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could create competitive advantages over us.
Foreign Ethanol Competitors

In recent years, the ethanol industry has experienced increased competition from international suppliers of ethanol and although ethanol imports have decreased during the past few years, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again, 
such increased imports could negatively impact demand for domestic ethanol which could adversely impact our financial results. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. 
Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugarcane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.
Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producer. Brazil makes ethanol primarily from sugarcane as opposed to corn, and depending on feedstock prices, may be less expensive to produce. Several large companies produce ethanol in Brazil, including affiliates of Bunge. Brazilian imports account for less than 1% of U.S. ethanol consumed. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of the Renewable Fuel Standard (the "RFS") as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for certain obligated parties to comply with the RFS2 requirement to blend 4.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. 
In March 2015, the Brazilian government increased the required percentage of ethanol in vehicle fuel sold in Brazil to 27% from 25% which, along with more competitively priced ethanol produced from corn, significantly reduced U.S. imports of ethanol produced in Brazil as compared to prior years. However, EIA data shows that during the first eight months of 2019, U.S. ethanol imports from Brazil increased to 84 million gallons from 21 million gallons in the first eight months of calendar 2018. If U.S. imports of ethanol from Brazil continue to increase, this could reduce demand for domestic ethanol and adversely impact ethanol prices in the U.S.
In order to address supply issues after the sugarcane harvest, some Brazilian ethanol plants have become "flex plants" enabling them to process year round with local corn as well as sugarcane. Two new processing plants are under construction which will substantially increase Brazilian ethanol production and thereby increase the inventory available for U.S. ethanol imports. Any additional increase in ethanol imports from Brazil will further increase domestic ethanol supplies in the United States and may result in ethanol price decreases.
Based on the current strength of the United States Dollar compared to the Brazilian Reis along with very favorable prices for sugarcane based ethanol in the United States, specifically in California, it is possible that ethanol imports from Brazil may increase in Fiscal 2020 which will further impact the level of ethanol supplies in the United States and may result in ethanol price decreases.
Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries, including Brazil, may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the United States.
Local Ethanol Production

Because we are located on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, and because ethanol producers generally compete primarily with local and regional producers, the ethanol producers located in Iowa and Nebraska presently constitute our primary competition.  According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, as of November 2019, Iowa had 42 ethanol refineries in production, with a combined nameplate capacity to produce 4.5 billion gallons of ethanol.  For Nebraska, the RFA reports there are currently 26 existing ethanol plants in production in Nebraska, with a combined ethanol nameplate production capacity of approximately 2.2 billion gallons.
Competition from Alternative Renewable Fuels
We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn, including cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Research continues regarding cellulosic ethanol, and various companies are in various stages of developing and constructing some of the first generation cellulosic plants. Several companies have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and, at a few companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future, although these cellulosic ethanol plants have continued to face financial and technological issues. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn 
based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
Because our Facility is designed as single-feedstock facilities, we have limited ability to adapt the plant to a different feedstock or process system without additional capital investment and retooling.
A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Like ethanol, the emerging fuel cell industry offers a technological option to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. Fuel cells have emerged as a potential alternative to certain existing power sources because of their higher efficiency, reduced noise and lower emissions. Fuel cell industry participants are currently targeting the transportation, stationary power and portable power markets in order to decrease fuel costs, lessen dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. If the fuel cell industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance and becomes readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grain Competition
Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. According to the RFA 2019 Ethanol Outlook (the "RFA 2019 Outlook") , ethanol plants produced almost 41.3 million metric tons of distillers grains and other animal feed.  We compete with other producers of distillers grains products both locally and nationally.
The primary customers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle, according to the RFA 2019 Outlook, which comprises 77% of distiller grains consumption. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine, poultry and fish markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from such expansion.
The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Distillers grains contain nutrients, fat content, and fiber that we believe will differentiate our distillers grains products from other feed formulations. However, producers of other forms of animal feed may also have greater experience and resources than we do and their products may have greater acceptance among producers of beef and dairy cattle, poultry and hogs.
Principal Supply & Demand Factors
Ethanol

Ethanol prices stayed low during Fiscal 2019, as small refinery waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") affecting the RFS created significant uncertainty in the market as well as the lack of federal action until May 31, 2019 on implementing the year-round use of E15 ethanol which did not allow for sufficient time to enable the ethanol industry to fully capitalize on increased E`15 sales during the 2019 peak summer driving season. Higher corn prices during Fiscal 2019 also impacted the margins on ethanol production. 
Management currently expects ethanol prices will continue to adjust to the supply and demand factors of ethanol and oil and will generally fluctuate with, but not be directly correlated to, the price of corn.  
Management believes the industry will need to grow both retail product delivery infrastructure and demand for ethanol in order to increase production margins in the near and long term.
Management also believes it is important that ethanol blending capabilities of the gasoline market be expanded to increase demand for ethanol.  Recently, there has been increased awareness of the need to expand retail ethanol distribution and blending infrastructure, which would allow the ethanol industry to supply ethanol to markets in the United States that are not currently selling significant amounts of ethanol. On June 1, 2019, President Trump initiated rulemaking to expand fuel waivers for E15 to allow year round sale of fuel blends containing gasoline up to a 15% blend of ethanol.Although there have been significant 
developments towards the availability of E15 in the marketplace and the recent EPA final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15, there are still obstacles that could inhibit meaningful market penetration by E15.
Distillers Grains
Distillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. In North America, over 80% of distillers grains are used in ruminant animal diets, and are also fed to poultry and swine.  Every bushel of corn used in the dry grind ethanol process yields approximately 17 pounds of dry matter distillers grains, which is an excellent source of energy and protein for livestock and poultry.  The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are derived. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans and corn, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.
Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have correlated with prices of corn. However, there have been occasions when the price increase for this co-product has not been directly correlated to changes in corn prices. In addition, our distillers grains compete with products made from other feedstocks, the cost of which may not rise when corn prices rise. Consequently, the price we may receive for distillers grains may not rise as corn prices rise, thereby lowering our cost recovery percentage relative to corn.
Management expects that distillers grain prices will continue to generally follow the price of corn during Fiscal 2020.
Competition for Supply of Corn
During crop year 2018/19, according to the USDA November 2019 report, 81.7 million acres of corn were harvested, which was down 1.1% from 2017. Although there were less acres planted, the expected yield is 176.4 bushels per acre, which is basically flat compared to 2017's results. For the crop year 2019/20, current projections are 81.8 million acres of corn to be harvested, but the yield per acre is projected to fall to 167.0 bushels per acre. This was due to adverse weather conditions during planting season and mid spring flooding in some parts of the Midwest. Prices for corn are expected to continue to increase as a result of the lower levels of production and yields forecasted by the USDA.
Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists around our Facility.  According to RFA 2019 Ethanol Industry Outlook, as of September 2019, there were 44 operational ethanol plants in Iowa. The plants are concentrated, for the most part, in the northern and central regions of the state where a majority of the corn is produced. A new ethanol plant in Atlantic, Iowa commenced operations in the third quarter of calendar year 2018, which continues to effect the Company's corn deliveries and prices paid for corn. 
We compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users. According to the USDA, for 2017/2018, 5.6 billion bushels of U.S. corn were used in ethanol production, with 7.1 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 2.4 billion bushels used for export.  For the crop year 2018/19, bushels of U.S. corn for ethanol production fell to 5.4 billion bushels used in ethanol production, with 6.8 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 2.1 billion bushels used for export. As of November 2019, the USDA has forecast the amount of corn to be used for ethanol production during the current marketing year flat at 5.4 billion bushels with flat forecasts for food and industrial use and for exports.
Federal Ethanol Support and Governmental Regulations

RFS and Related Federal Legislation

The ethanol industry is dependent on, and receives significant federal support from, the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”) which has been and will continue to be a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage. The RFS requires that in each year a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is responsible for revising and implementing regulations to ensure that transportation fuel sold in the United States contains a minimum volume of renewable fuel.  
The RFS original statutory volume requirements increase incrementally each year through 2022 when the mandate requires that the United States use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels.  Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must 
be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
Annually, the EPA is supposed to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation. On November 30, 2018, the EPA issued the final rule that set the 2019 annual volume requirements for renewable fuel at 19.92 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year (the "Final 2019 Rule"). On July 5, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule for 2020 which set the annual volume requirements renewable fuel at 20.04 billion gallons of renewable fuel (the "Proposed 2020 Rule"). Both the Final 2019 Rule and the Proposed 2020 Rule maintained the number of gallons that may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons. A public hearing on the Proposed 2020 Rule was held in July and the public comment period expired on August 30, 2019. The final rule was expected to be issued in November 2019. 
However, on October 15, 2019, the EPA released a supplemental notice seeking additional comments on a proposed rule on adjustments to the way that annual renewable fuel percentages are calculated. The supplemental notice was issued in response to an announcement on October 4, 2019, by President Trump of a proposed plan to require refiners not exempt from the rules to blend additional gallons of ethanol to make up for the gallons exempted by the EPA's expanded use of waivers to small refineries. The effect of these waivers is that the refinery is no longer required to earn or purchase blending credits, known as RINs, negatively affecting ethanol demand and resulting in lower ethanol prices. The proposed plan was expected to calculate the volume that refiners were required to blend by using a three-year average of exempted gallons. However, the EPA proposed to use a three-year average to account for the reduction in demand resulting from the waivers using the number of gallons of relief recommended by the United States Department of Energy. A public hearing on the proposed rule was held October 30 and the public comment period expired on November 30, 2019. The EPA is expected to finalize the Proposed 2020 Rule and the issues set out in the supplemental notice later in 2019. 
Although the volume requirements set forth in the Final 2019 Rule are slightly higher than the final 2018 volume requirements (the "Final 2018 Rule") and the Proposed 2020 Rule volume requirements are slightly higher than those set forth in the Final 2019 Rule, the volume requirements under the Final 2018 Rule, the Final 2019 Rule and the Proposed 2020 Rule are all still significantly below the 26 billion gallons, 28 billion gallons and 30 billion gallons, respectively, statutory mandates, with significant reductions in the volume requirements for advanced biofuels as well.
Under the RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. the Final 2018 Rule represent the first year the total proposed volume requirements were more than 20% below statutory levels. In response, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The Final 2019 Rule is approximately 29% below the statutory levels representing the second consecutive year of reductions of more than 20% below the statutory mandates therefore triggering the mandatory reset under the RFS. The EPA is now statutorily required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the volume requirements post-2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of agricultural commodities, food prices, and rural economic development.
In October 2018, the Trump administration released timelines for certain EPA rulemaking initiatives relating to the RFS including the “reset” of the statutory blending targets. The EPA is expected to propose rules modifying the applicable statutory volume targets for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for the years 2020-2022. 
Federal mandates supporting the use of renewable fuels like the RFS are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Ethanol policies are influenced by environmental concerns, diversifying our fuel supply, and an interest in reducing the country’s dependence on foreign oil. Consumer acceptance of flex-fuel vehicles and higher ethanol blends of ethanol in non-flex-fuel vehicles may be necessary before ethanol can achieve significant growth in U.S. market share. Another important factor is a waiver in the Clean Air Act, known as the "One-Pound Waiver", which allows E10 to be sold year-round, even though it exceeds the RVP limitation of nine pounds per square inch. At the end of May 2019, the EPA finalized a rule which extended the One-Pound Waiver to E15 so its sale can expand beyond flex-fuel vehicles during the June 1 to September 15 summer driving season. This rule is being challenged in court; however, the One-Pound Waiver is in effect, and E15 can be sold year round. However, with respect to the 2019 summer driving season, because the rule was not finalized until the end of May, the ethanol industry was unable to fully capitalize on increased E15 sales during the 2019 peak summer driving season.
Despite the recent actions by the Trump administration relating to E15, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the RFS as a result of the significant number of waivers granted by the EPA exempting certain small refiners from the volume purchase requirements of the RFS. Under the RFS, the EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total domestic transportation fuel sales. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by ethanol producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties.
Although the Final 2018 Rule, the Final 2019 Rule and the Proposed 2020 Rule all maintain the number of gallons which may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons this number does not take into account waivers granted by the EPA to small refiners for "hardship." The EPA can, in consultation with the Department of Energy, waive the obligation for individual smaller refineries that are suffering “disproportionate economic hardship” due to compliance with the RFS. To qualify, for this “small refinery waiver,” the refineries must be under total throughput of 75,000 barrels per day and state their case for an exemption in an application to the EPA each year. These waivers allowed the recipient to no longer comply with the requirements of the RFS. 
The EPA has substantially expanded the granting of these waiver requests since 2015 with 7 waivers granted for compliance year 2015, 19 granted for compliance year 2016, and 35 granted for compliance year 2017. Although the EPA had previously announced that it was suspending the waiver program pending review in 2019, the industry has not seen any evidence to support this position and in fact, on August 9, 2019, the EPA announced that it had granted 31 waiver applications for compliance year 2018 with two additional waiver applications still pending. The EPA also failed to address reallocating lost blending volumes, nor mention the impact of the "hardship" waivers on the volume requirements set out in the Final 2019 Rule or the Proposed 2020 Rule. The waivers granted for the 2018 compliance year alone effectively reduced the amount of biofuel required to enter the nation’s fuel supply by exempting 7.4% of the total RFS renewable fuel 2018 volume mandate, or about 1.43 billion gallons. 
The mechanism that provides accountability in RFS compliance is the Renewable Identification Number (RIN). RINs are a tradeable commodity given that if refiners (obligated parties) need additional RINs to be compliant, they have to purchase them from those that have excess. Thus, there is an economic incentive to use renewable fuels like ethanol, or in the alternative, buy RINs. Granting these small refinery waivers effectively reduces the annual renewable volume obligation for each year by that amount as the waivers exempt the obligating parties from meeting the RFS blending targets and the waived gallons are not reallocated to other obligated parties at this time. The resulting surplus of RINs in the market has brought values down significantly. Since the RIN value helps to make higher blends of ethanol more cost effective, lower RIN values could negatively impact retailer and consumer adoption of E15 and higher blends. The EPA’s allowance of numerous waivers and the resulting surplus of RINs in the market has driven down RIN values significantly from RIN prices of 75 cents in 2016 and 2017 to under $0.20 so far in 2019. If the EPA continues to grant discretionary waivers and RIN prices continue to fall, it could negatively affect ethanol prices.
In response to the EPA granting over 30 small refinery exemptions in 2019, over 15 plants have shut down while other plants have limited production. The RFA estimates that approximately 20 ethanol plants have been temporarily idled or permanently closed since the EPA began to expand the volume of the small refinery exemptions granted. The Trump Administration has not announced a plan to reallocate ethanol gallons lost to exemptions in the current year and therefore, the continued granting of waivers and the failure of the Trump Administration to take any action to reallocate the lost exemptions will continue to negatively impact ethanol demand and RIN and ethanol prices. 
Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the Final 2019 Rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rulemaking. This is the first RFS rulemaking since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light, however the EPA has refused to cap the number of waivers it grants or how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its percentage standard calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. The EPA's current approach runs counter to this statutory mandate and undermines Congressional intent. Biofuels groups argue the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future.
If the EPA’s decisions to reduce the volume requirements under the RFS statutory mandates is allowed to stand, if the volume requirements are further reduced, if the EPA continues to grant waivers to small refiners or if the EPA refuses to reallocate the lost blending volumes resulting from the previously granted small refiner waivers, the market price and demand for ethanol would be adversely effected which would negatively impact our financial performance.
On May 18, 2018, the Advanced Biofuel Association initiated a legal challenge to the EPA’s process for granting exemptions from compliance under the RFS to small refineries. In its petition, the Advanced Biofuel Association seeks judicial review of the EPA’s decision to modify criteria to lower the threshold by which the agency determines whether to grant small 
refineries an exemption for the RFS for reasons of disproportionate economic hardship. The court dismissed the case on November 12, 2019, although agreed with the Advanced Biofuel Association that the EPA did not provide a "viable avenue for judicial review."
Additionally, on May 29, 2018, the National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union and the Renewable Fuels Association filed a petition challenging the EPA’s grant of waivers to three specific refineries seeking that the court reject the waivers granted to the three as an abuse of EPA authority.  These waived gallons are not redistributed to obligated parties, and in effect, reduce the aggregate Renewable Volume Obligations or "RVOs" under the RFS. If the specific waivers granted by the EPA and/or its lower criteria for granting small refinery waivers under the RFS are allowed to stand, or if the volume requirements are further reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance.
Related to the recent lawsuits, the Renewable Fuels Association, American Coalition for Ethanol, Growth Energy, National Biodiesel Board, National Corn Growers Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, and National Farmers Union petitioned the EPA on June 4, 2018 to change its regulations to account for lost volumes of renewable fuel resulting from the retroactive small refinery exemptions. This petition to the EPA seeks a broader, forward-looking remedy to account for the collective lost volumes caused by the recent increase in retroactive small refinery RVO exemptions. It is unclear what regulatory changes, if any, will emerge from the petition to the EPA.
In 2017, the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of biofuel groups against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements by 500 million gallons. As a result, the court remanded to the EPA to make up for the 500 million gallons. Despite this, during the 2019 volume requirement rulemaking, the EPA stated it does not intend to make up the 500 million gallons as the court directed, citing potential burden on obligated parties. It is anticipated litigation will ensue from this matter.
On February 4, 2019, Growth Energy filed a lawsuit in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against the EPA challenging the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the Final 2019 Rule. 
Although the maintenance of the 15 billion gallon threshold for volume requirements that may be met with corn-based ethanol in the Final 2018 Rule, the Final 2019 Rule and the Proposed 2020 Rule together with the application of the One-Pound Waiver to E15 permitting the year round sale of E15 signals support from the EPA and the Trump administration for domestic ethanol production, the Trump administration could still elect to materially modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate the RFS and it is unclear what regulatory framework and renewable volume requirements, if any, will emerge as a result of any such reforms; however, any such reform could adversely affect the demand and price for ethanol and our profitability.
On February 3, 2010, the EPA implemented new regulations governing the RFS which are referred to as "RFS2". The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions.
Based on the final regulations, we believe our Facility, at its current operating capacity, was grandfathered into the RFS given it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and therefore is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions.   However, expansion of our Facility will require us to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to expand capacity at our Facility, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. 
Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce.
State Initiatives and Mandates

In 2006, Iowa passed legislation promoting the use of renewable fuels in Iowa.  One of the most significant provisions of the Iowa renewable fuels legislation is a renewable fuels standard encouraging 10% of the gasoline sold in Iowa to consist of 
renewable fuels.  This renewable fuels standard increases incrementally to 25% of the gasoline sold in Iowa by 2020. To reach that goal, the use of E85 will have to climb dramatically. Gas stations that embrace E85 will be in line for state tax credits and also incentives. To qualify under the bill, ethanol must be agriculturally-derived. 
E85

Demand for ethanol has been affected by moderately increased consumption of E85 fuel, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, which is available for use in flex fuel vehicles.  There are more than 24 million flex fuel vehicles on the road today, or approximately 8% of all vehicles, representing more vehicles than require premium gasoline today.  In addition to use as a fuel in flexible fuel vehicles, E85 can be used as an aviation fuel, as reported by the National Corn Growers Association, and as a hydrogen source for fuel cells. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there are currently more than 24 million flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on E85 in the United States and nearly all of the major automakers have available flexible fuel modes and have indicated plans to produce several million more flexible fuel vehicles per year.  The Renewable Fuels Association reports that there are more than 4,700 retail gasoline stations supplying E85 or other ethanol flex fuel blends.  While the number of retail E85 suppliers has increased each year, this remains a relatively small percentage of the total number of U.S. retail gasoline stations, which is approximately 170,000.  In order for E85 fuel to increase demand for ethanol, it must be available for consumers to purchase it.  As public awareness of ethanol and E85 increases along with E85’s increased availability, management anticipates some growth in demand for ethanol associated with increased E85 consumption. The USDA provides financial assistance to help implement “blender pumps” in the United States in order to increase demand for ethanol and to help offset the cost of introducing mid-level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. 
Changes in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards have also benefited the ethanol industry by encouraging use of E85 fuel products. CAFE provides an effective 54% efficiency bonus to flexible-fuel vehicles running on E85. This variance encourages auto manufacturers to build more flexible-fuel models, particularly in trucks and sport utility vehicles that are otherwise unlikely to meet CAFE standards.
E15

E15 is a blend of higher octane gasoline and up to 15% ethanol.  E15 was approved for use in model year 2001 and newer cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles (SUVs) and all flex-fuel vehicles by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2012, This approved group of vehicles includes 90% of the cars, trucks and SUVs on the road today According to the Renewable Fuel Association, this higher octane fuel is available in 30 states at retail fueling stations. Sheetz, Kum & Go, Murphy USA, MAPCO Express, Protec Fuel, Minnoco, Thornton's, Hy-Vee, Growmark and Casey's all offer E15 to 2001 and newer vehicles today at several stations. One of the historic challenges with the growth of the E15 market is the fact that, the waiver in the Clean Air Act, known as the One-Pound Waiver, which allows E10 to be sold year-round, does not apply to E15 or higher blends, even though it has similar physical properties to E10. On March 12, 2019, the EPA proposed regulatory changes to allow E15 to take advantage of the One-Pound Waiver and authorized the sale of E15 during the summer months even though it exceeds the Reid Vapor Pressure limitation. At the end of May 2019, the EPA finalized the rule extending the One-Pound Waiver to E15 so its sale can expand beyond flex-fuel vehicles during the June 1 to September 15 summer driving season. This rule is being challenged in an action filed in Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit.
In May 2015, the USDA announced that the agency will make significant investments in a biofuels infrastructure partnership to double the number of renewable fuel blender pumps that can supply consumers with higher ethanol blends, like E15 and E85. The program provides competitive grants, matched by states, to help implement “blender pumps” in the United States in order to increase demand for ethanol and to help offset the cost of introducing mid-level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E15, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. The USDA biofuels infrastructure partnership program had provided $210 million to fund the installation of new ethanol infrastructure at nearly 1,500 stations in 20 states. Installations began in 2016 and continued into 2019, which will 
significantly increase the number of stations selling both E15 and E85. The USDA reports that to date, 20 states have received BIP Federal Funding amounts of almost $100M that covers almost 1,500 stations with almost 5,000 proposed pumps.
Cellulosic Ethanol

The Energy Independence and Security Act provided numerous funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol. In addition, RFS2 mandates an increasing level of production of biofuels which are not derived from corn. These policies suggest an increasing policy preference away from corn ethanol and toward cellulosic ethanol. 
Environmental and Other Regulations and Permits
Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate matters, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide.  Ethanol production also requires the use of significant volumes of water, a portion of which is treated and discharged into the environment.  We are required to maintain various environmental and operating permits.  Even though we have successfully acquired the permits necessary for our operations, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such regulations.  In addition, if we sought to expand the Facility’s capacity in the future, above our current 140 million gallons, we would likely be required to acquire additional regulatory permits and could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment.   Our failure to obtain and maintain any environmental and/or operating permits currently required or which may be required in the future could force us to make material changes to our Facility or to shut down altogether.  
The U.S. Supreme Court has classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. As stated above, we believe the final RFS2 regulations grandfather our plant at its current operating capacity, though expansion of our plant will need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to expand capacity at our plant above our current permitted 140 million gallons, we will be required to obtain additional permits and install improved technology.
Separately, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (the "LCFS") requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 2020 using a lifecycle GHG emissions calculation. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. CARB appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on the overall market demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices. 
Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Other examples of government policies that can have an impact on our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos.
We also employ maintenance and operations personnel at our Facility. In addition to the attention that we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations at our Facility are governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
