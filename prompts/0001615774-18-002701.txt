ITEM 1. Description of the Business
Our Company
 
Background
 
On January 18, 2016, Vitaxel Group Limited completed and closed a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) under a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) of the same date among us, Vitaxel SDN BHD, a Malaysian corporation (“Vitaxel”), the shareholders of Vitaxel, Vitaxel Online Mall SBN BHD, a Malaysian corporation (“Vionmall”) and the shareholders of Vionmall pursuant to which Vitaxel and Vionmall each became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we exchanged 3,499,125,000 shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock of Vitaxel and exchanged 499,875,000 shares of our common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock of Vionmall with the result that both Vitaxel and Vionmall became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange, we acquired the business of Vitaxel to engage in the direct selling of products and services utilizing a multi-level marketing model with an emphasis on travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services and the business of Vionmall to develop online shopping platforms geared to Vitaxel and its members and the third party suppliers of products and services.
 
On January 6, 2016, the holder (the “Majority Stockholder”) of approximately 78.43% of the voting power of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, approved by written consent, in accordance with Nevada law, Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Restated Articles”) which, among other things (i) changed our name from “Albero, Corp.” to “Vitaxel Group Limited” (the “Name Change”) and (ii) increased our number of authorized shares of capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share to 7,100,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 7,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.000001 per share and (b) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the “Share Increase”). The Restated Articles, including the Name Change and the Share Increase, and their execution and filing were authorized by the sole member of our Board of Directors on December 21, 2015.
 
On January 8, 2016, we filed the Restated Articles with the Nevada Secretary of State to effectuate, among other things, the Name Change and the Share Increase.
 
On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a 1,333-for-1 forward stock split of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.000001 per share in the form of a dividend (the “Stock Split”) with a record date of February 8, 2016 (the “Record Date”). On February 22, 2016, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) notified us of its announcement of the payment date of the Stock Split as February 23, 2016 (the “Payment Date”). On the Payment Date, as a result of the Stock split, each holder of our common stock as of the Record Date received 1,333 additional shares of our common stock for each one share owned, rounded up to the nearest whole share. All common stock share amounts referenced in this Annual Report give retroactive effect to the Stock Split.
 
On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from October 31 of each year to December 31 of each year. December 31 is also the fiscal year end for each of Vitaxel and Vionmall.

On May 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized and approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which authorized a one hundred-to-one reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, with a record date of June 12, 2017 (the “Record Date”). 
 
On May 30, 2017, the Board of Directors of Vitaxel authorized and approved a related increase in the par value of the Vitaxel common stock from $0.000001 to $0.0001.
 
On June 12, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to effect a 1:100 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”). The effective date of the Reverse Split will be June 15, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). On the Effective Date, every 100 outstanding shares of our common stock shall, without further action by us or the holders thereof, become one share of common stock. No fractional shares shall be issued in connection with the Reverse Split. A stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive one whole share. As of the Effective Date, our authorized shares of capital stock shall be reduced in proportion to the Reverse Split ratio. Accordingly, our 7,000,000,000 shares of authorized common stock prior to the Effective Date shall become 70,000,000 shares of authorized common stock on the Effective Date, and our 100,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock prior to the Effective Date shall become 1,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock on the Effective Date. Additionally, as part of the Reverse Split, the par value of both our common stock and our preferred stock has been increased from $0.000001 per share to $0.0001 per share, as reflected in the Certificate of Amendment. Under Nevada law, the Reverse Split and corresponding reduction in authorized common stock and preferred stock, and increase in par value of both classes of our stock, did not require shareholder approval.
 
On June 13, 2017 we received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to effectuate the Reverse Split at the open of business on June 15, 2017. At such time, our trading symbol temporarily changed to “VXELD.” The added “D” will remain for 20 business days after which our trading symbol will revert back to “VXEL.” When the reverse stock split became effective, every one hundred shares of our pre-split issued and outstanding common stock, par value 0.000001 per share, automatically converted into one post-split share of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and with a corresponding reduction of the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue and increase in par value. All fractional shares which would otherwise result from the reverse stock split will be rounded up. The new CUSIP number for our common stock following effectiveness of the reverse stock split will be 92849Y206.
  
On December 15, 2017, we entered into a Share Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Lim Hui Sing and Leong Yee Ming (together, the “Sellers”) and Vitaxel Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Purchaser”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at the closing for the transaction, the Sellers will sell to the Purchaser all their shares in Grande Legacy Inc., a British Virgin Islands company (“Grande Legacy”), so that the Company shall become the indirect owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Grande Legacy. In consideration for such sale, we shall issue to each of the Sellers 37,500,000 shares of our common stock.
 
On January 3, 2018 the parties to the Agreement executed and delivered an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Agreement which provided that the acquisition of Grande Legacy shall close upon the completion of the financial statements of Grande Legacy being audited. The Amendment also provides that the 75,000,000 shares to be issued to the Sellers will be issued within 30 days of the shareholders of the Company authorizing the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation increasing the amount of shares that we are authorized to issue. Since the audited financial statements of Grande Legacy were delivered on January 22, 2018, the acquisition of Grande Legacy was consummated on said date.
 
On January 30, 2018, the Company received a joint written consent in lieu of a meeting (the “ Joint Written Consent ”) from the members of the Board of Directors and the holders of a majority of the issued shares of common stock representing approximately 60% of the voting stock of the Company. The Joint Written Consent adopted resolutions which authorized the Company to act on a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company from 70,000,000 to 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.
 
Our Current Business, Markets and Strategy
 
We are a global direct selling, multi-level marketing (“MLM”) company offering travel, entertainment, lifestyle and other products and services principally through electronic commerce commonly referred to as e-commerce. Through Vionmall, which went live in January 2016 for Vitaxel members and April 2016 for the general public, we employ online shopping web sites for retail sales direct to consumers. We do not develop or manufacture the products and services which we offer. Our principal offices are located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At December 31, 2017, all of our operations, including sales transactions, were based and completed in Malaysia although we had members in three other Asian countries. As of such date, there are approximately 52.5% members reside in Malaysia, approximately 28% members reside in Thailand, approximately 15% member reside in Singapore, and approximately 4.5% members reside in other countries. We provide our members from time-to-time with training which includes prospecting and closing skills, plan orientation, back-office training, network management, personal and leadership development and team-building activities.

Unlike the traditional MLM business model where most of the business model concentrates on particular products and/or services, our business model allows our members to own a sub-domain through Vionmall where they can promote their own products and services (separate from our products and services). We believe that this model is the first of its kind in Asia.
 
We strive to differentiate ourselves through innovation in both our product and service offerings and our sales channels. Consumers can purchase our products and services either directly from our members or directly from our online platform. Our products and services are listed on our website and customers can easily purchase them online. Our members need not carry our products physically to their customers, they only need to promote our products through word of mouth or show prospective customers our list of products online through computers or smart-phones. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our revenues were primarily attributable to the sale of Vitaxel product packages.
 
Our Vitaxel packages include product points (which are exchangeable for tour and travel products or travel kits). Since we are relatively new to the market, our initial strategy has been to promote our brand awareness by encouraging more people to become members. In furtherance thereof, to date all membership fees have been waived. Persons that purchase our product packages will automatically become members.
 
In furtherance of our membership benefits program, on November 1, 2015 Vitaxel entered into a Travel Agency Services Contract (the “Contract”) with Ho Wah Genting Holiday SDN BHD (“HWGH”), a travel agency specializing in providing tour packages, hotel bookings, arranging transportation and event ticket services. Pursuant thereto, HWGH provides services to Vitaxel’s members. The Contract has a term of 2 years and continues automatically for additional one year periods. After the first year, either party may terminate the Contract by providing the other party with 2 months’ advance notice of termination. Lim Chun Hoo, a director of HWGH is the brother of Lim Wee Kiat, our Chairman and Secretary and the son of Dato Lim Hui Boon, our President. Lim Wee Kiat is also an executive director of Ho Wah Genting Berhad, a shareholder of HWGH.
 
On August 6, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Vitaxel Private Limited, a limited liability entity and incorporated in Taiwan. Pursuant to this agreement, we granted Vitaxel Private Limited an exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our trademarks, brands, logos or service marks to market and operate our business and commercialize our online shopping and service platforms, including but not limited to Vionmall in Taiwan. The term of this agreement is three years with a possibility of renewal for another three years. We and or our subsidiaries will have the right of first refusal to acquire Vitaxel Private Limited if its shareholders decide to dispose its assets or the company. Vitaxel Private Limited is in charge of all initial costs of setting up its business in Taiwan. Vitaxel Private Limited shall pay us a revenue share of 70% of the net profits for every three month period. Each such royalty payment is due on the tenth day of every fourth months and shall be paid in U.S. currency and accompanied by a report of calculation of the net profits.
 
On August 15, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Vitaxel Corp (Thailand) Ltd., a limited liability entity and incorporated in Thailand, as amended on August 21, 2016 to, among other things, extend the term from three years with a three-year renewal term to 10 years with a 10-year renewal term. Pursuant to this agreement, we granted Vitaxel Corp. (Thailand) Ltd. an exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our trademarks, brands, logos or service marks to market and operate our business and commercialize our online shopping and service platforms, including but not limited to our online shopping mall known as “Vionmall”, in Thailand.

On January 5, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with Grande Legacy Inc., a BVI Business Company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Pursuant to this agreement, we granted Grande Legacy Inc. an exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our trademarks, brands, logos or service marks to market and operate our business and commercialize our online shopping and service platform, including but not limited to our online shopping mall known as “Vionmall”, in United State of America, South Korea, Japan and other part of the world that agreeable by the Company.

Our initial Vitaxel products have not generated material demand. This has resulted in marginal purchases of our existing Vitaxel products. However, following our research and surveys conducted on the preferences of our members, we have re-packaged and expanded our product packages and the method of selling these products to our members and our customers. This strategy lead to the formation of Vionmall.
 
With the introduction of Vionmall in January 2016, our revenue component has been divided into three categories as follows:
 

● | Vitaxel Product packages
--+-------------------------


● | Membership fees
--+----------------


● | Sales from our online Vionmall products
--+----------------------------------------

 
We believe that the Malaysian and other Asian direct selling markets hold significant potential. Our results, as reported in U.S. dollars will be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations as well as global economic, political, demographic and business trends and conditions.

We acquire the products and services which we offer and sell from third parties. Although, we initially intend to primarily offer and sell products related to travel, entertainment and lifestyle, we are not limited to those areas and may sell unrelated products and services as long as these products and services will benefit our members and customers in a manner consistent with our objectives and mission.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,802 members, with approximately 4,099 members in Malaysia, approximately 2,182 members in Thailand, approximately 1,170 members in Singapore, approximately 121 members in the Hong Kong, approximately 82 members in China, approximately 74 members in Taiwan, approximately 47 members in Indonesia and approximately 27 members in other countries. Our members include approximately 3,335 Distributors, 2,028 Supervisors, 72 Managers, 40 Directors, 1,984 Senior Directors, 158 Global Directors, 89 Sapphire Global Directors, 66 Ruby Global Directors, 14 Emerald Global Directors, 6 Diamond Global Directors and 10 Black Diamond Global Directors. The ranking has been discontinue effective from January 1, 2018, however, those that has achieved the ranks before the discontinue date are entitle to keep their rank title
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have a network member base of approximately 13 Asian countries and approximately 7 other countries. While sales within our local markets may fluctuate due to economic, market and regulatory conditions, competitive pressures, political and social instability or for Company-specific reasons, we believe that our geographic diversity and intended further geographic diversity mitigates and will continue to mitigate our exposure to any one particular market. 
 
People become members for a number of reasons. Some join simply to receive a wholesale price on products and services that they and their families can enjoy. Some join to earn part-time money, wanting to give direct sales a try, whereas others are drawn to us because they can be their own boss and can earn rewards on their own skills and hard work. In addition to discounted prices, members can earn income from several sources. Members may earn income by selling our products and services and their own products and services. The allocation of proceeds from the sales of members’ products and services is similar to the allocation process for independent suppliers of products and services. Suppliers determine the minimum amount they wish to receive, the retail price to consumers is then negotiated between us and the supplier and we retain the difference as profit. Also, members who sponsor other members may earn commissions and bonuses based upon their sponsored members’ performance.
 
We intend to continue to engage team leaders within each country in Asia in which we offer and sell our products to lead and promote our products. Since we have already established our name in certain of the Asian counties, we will continue to expand in those countries by providing more benefits to the team leaders, more attractive products through our Vionmall portal, further training and motivation talks, better information technology structure and enhance support systems.
 
To become a member, a person must purchase a member package. Member packages include products and points that carry a value that approximates the package price. The packages do not come with a membership fees because membership fees are exempted for the first year (that is when members purchase the package, membership fees are waived for the first 12 months). We only collect the membership fees from the second year onwards. Each member package is available in English and Chinese and typically includes booklets describing us, our compensation plan and rules of member conduct, various training and promotional materials, member applications and a product and services catalog. The price of a member package varies by package type and provides a low cost entry for incoming members.
 
Competition
 
The categories of travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services are very competitive and are available through many channels including those of direct selling and the Internet. We try to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our member focus on the consultative and educational nature of the sales process and the contact that our members have with their customers.
 
We are subject to competition for the recruitment of members from other network marketing organizations, including those that market similar products and services as well as other types of products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on having relevant products that meet consumer needs, a rewarding compensation plan, and a financially viable company.
 
As a company, we believe that the direct selling channel is an effective way to sell our products and services. We believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products and services because demand for travel, entertainment and lifestyle products and services is strengthened by ongoing personal contact and education between members and their customers. In addition, our members consume our products and services themselves, and therefore can provide first-hand testimonials about our products and services, which can serve as a powerful sales tool.
 
We believe our business model enables us to grow our business with moderate investment in our infrastructure and fixed costs. We incur no direct incremental cost to add a new member in our existing markets or add additional products and services to our product and service mix, and our member compensation varies directly with sales. Furthermore, we can readily increase production and distribution of our products and services as a result of having access to numerous third party relationships.

To date, all of the applications Malaysia and the other applications from the other 12 countries except Indonesia have been approved.

To date, this trademark has been approved in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines, Myanmar, Macau, Laos and Taiwan and other countries including United States of America are pending for approval. We consider trademark protection to be important to our business.
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Many countries have either implemented new laws or made revisions to existing laws on direct selling in the last decade. Both developed and developing economies have realized the potential of the direct selling industry in light of the positive socio-economic impact of this sector – both directly and indirectly.
 
Along with the primary objective of regulating various fraudulent schemes, these countries have also enacted specific legislations largely self-monitored by local associations. Globally, these regulations relating to direct selling industry vary from country to country. Certain countries, including Malaysia, have enacted specific anti-pyramid laws to deal with frauds and abusive schemes, however, through specific regulations, they distinguish permissible MLM operations by direct selling companies. On the other hand, some countries primarily focus on consumer protection and strive to identify fraudulent schemes.
 
The substantive provisions governing direct selling businesses in various countries are founded on similar principles such as drafting a precise definition of direct selling business, pre-licensing of direct selling company, registration of direct sellers, stipulations governing activities and rewards/bonuses received by direct sellers, bans on entry fees, extensive buy-back policies and related matters.
 
The global level, direct selling industry self –regulates itself to maintain high levels of probity, integrity, corporate governance and consumer protection standards. Multiple direct selling companies from across the world have also joined forces to form direct selling associations which promote ethical business practices and prescribe a detailed code of ethics for the members, its sales representatives and customers. The code of conduct is a self –regulatory standard which regulates the varying interactions across the spectrum of direct sales that often exceeds local legal requirements.
 
The World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (“WFDSA”) is a non-governmental, voluntary organization globally representing the direct selling industry as a Federation of 60 national Direct Selling Associations (“DSA’s”) and one regional DSA – Federation of European DSA (Seldia). The “World Selling Code of Conduct” (‘the Code’) was published by the WFDSA for National DSA members. This Code establishes a standard framework for interaction between direct selling member companies, their direct sellers and consumers. The Code is a constantly evolving cornerstone of the direct selling industry’s commitment to ethical business practices and customer service. It is a mechanism that helps ensure that independent salespeople and customers are treated fairly and respectfully.
 
In order for a DSA to become a member of WFDSA, it must adopt the minimum standards set forth by the Code to the extent the requirements are consistent with the law in each particular country. Every DSA member company pledges to abide by the Code’s standards and procedures as a condition of admission and continued membership in a DSA. These Code of Ethics are enforced by an independent code administrator who is not connected with any member company. The code administrator will do everything possible to ensure Code compliance and where complaints exist, has the power to decide on remedies. All member companies agree to honor the administrator’s decisions. Broadly, the Code seeks to capture various aspects of a direct selling business which need to be regulated including use of misleading testimonials, misrepresentation of actual or potential earning claims or use of any exploitative and deceptive recruitment practices.
 
The entire Code has been classified into three sections containing regulations in respect of:
 

● | Conduct for the Protection of Consumers 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Conduct Between Companies and Direct Sellers 
● | Conduct Between Companies. 

 Further, to help ensure legal compliance, the Code provides that new memberships should not be subject to significant monetary commitment either by way of entrance fees, training fees, purchases of sales kits or inventory loading. The companies take responsibility for consumer protection through provision of accurate information, product warranty and buyback offers. It ensures that member companies implement adequate mechanisms to address customer complaints with respect to their products and/or its sales representatives.
 
The Code is a self-regulation and not a law, therefore, does not restate all legal obligations. Compliance with local laws pertaining to direct selling by National DSA’s is a condition of acceptance by or continuance of membership in DSA. The Code also has a provision for an extra-territorial effect wherein every national DSA pledges that it will require each member to comply with the WFDSA World Codes of Conduct for Direct Selling with regard to direct selling activities outside of its home country, unless those activities are under the jurisdiction of Codes of Conduct of another country’s DSA to which the member also belongs.
 
Malaysia is a member of the WFDSA and has drafted a standard code of ethics for companies engaged in direct selling activities.
 
Regulations in Malaysia
 
In 1978, the Direct Selling Association of Malaysia was founded to promote the direct selling industry on a national and international level, as well as act as the de facto voice of the industry. Malaysia’s strong belief in business without borders and that direct selling is a source of empowerment of people across the globe, led to the enactment of an extensive legal regime governing business activities of direct selling companies in the form of the Direct Sales Act, 1993.

Over the years, the success of direct selling companies in Malaysia was accompanied by the rise of fraudulent activities such as pyramid and Ponzi schemes. In 2011, Malaysia amended the existing statute to rename it as the ‘Direct Sales and Anti-Pyramid Scheme Act (the “DSAPSA”). The key objectives of amending the existing law were to incorporate specific provisions governing sales achieved through electronic medium and regulations on legitimate multilevel marketing.
 
The DSAPSA provides for:
 

● | Licensing of direct sales activities for the protection of the consumer’s rights and interest; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Promotion and regulation of the growth and development of ethical direct sales activities; and 
● | Prohibition of all activities involving pyramid schemes, chain distribution schemes or other similar schemes. 

 
All door-to door sales and mail order selling (including selling by telephone) in Malaysia are subject to the DSAPSA which sets forth the conditions under which business may be conducted, defines requirements of direct sales contracts, identifies conditions under which licenses may not be granted or revoked and the punishment for fraud. The DSAPSA also provides for a cooling-off period of 10 days after the date of making a direct sales contract. The regulating authority is the ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs.
 
The DSAPSA also stipulates that any person negotiating a door-to door sale will have to produce an identification card and authority card. This protects consumers from fraudulent schemes. In Malaysia, direct sellers are treated as independent contractors. The following types of marketing plans are presently covered under the provisions of the DSAPSA:
 

● | Door-to-door sales (Multilevel marketing plan/ Single marketing plan) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mail Order sales 
● | Sales through electronic transactions. 

 There is no prohibition on the sales of specific products. However, direct selling companies wanting to introduce new products must seek prior approval from the relevant authority before distributing the products. Also, all health products must be registered with the Drug Control Authority, Ministry of Health, before they can be sold through this mode.
 
The Direct Selling Association of Malaysia (“DSAM”)
 
The DSAM functions at the societal level to create and maintain an environment that is conductive to the growth and stability of the direct selling industry in Malaysia. Established in 1978 as a national trade association, it is led by a President and Vice-President and 7 committee members, all of whom are elected by member companies. In addition to the cooperation extended by member companies, the DSAM works closely with the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives & Consumerism, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, other government bodies and trade associations to achieve common goals. The DSAM Code of Conduct is an example of self-regulation. It is a strict and effective code of conduct implemented worldwide, and endorsed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives & Consumerism.
Research and Development Activities
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, we may elect to initiate research and development activities, but we have no plans for any activities to date.
Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are not subject to any environmental laws.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have 17 full time employees, all of which are located in Malaysia. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good to excellent.
