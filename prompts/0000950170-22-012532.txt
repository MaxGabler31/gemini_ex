OVERVIEW
 GENERAL
 Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (“Neptune”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a modern consumer packaged goods ("CPG") company driven by a singular purpose: to transform the everyday for a healthier tomorrow. Neptune is a diversified and fully integrated health and wellness company with multiple brand units. With a mission to redefine health and wellness, Neptune is focused on building a broad portfolio of high quality, affordable consumer products in response to long-term secular trends and market demand for natural, plant-based, sustainable and purpose-driven lifestyle brands. The Company utilizes a highly flexible, cost efficient manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure that can be scaled up and down or into adjacent product categories to identify new innovation opportunities, quickly adapt to consumer preferences and demand, and bring new products to market through its mass retail partners and e-commerce channels. Leveraging decades of expertise in extraction and product formulation, Neptune is a provider of turnkey product development and supply chain solutions to business customers across several health and wellness verticals, including nutraceuticals and white label consumer packaged goods. Neptune has expanded its operations since June 2020 into several brand units in order to better address its markets. The main brand units are the following: Nutraceuticals, Beauty & Personal Care, and Organic Foods & Beverages. All amounts in this Annual Report are in US dollars, unless otherwise noted.
HISTORY
 Neptune was incorporated under Part IA of the Companies Act (Québec) on October 9, 1998 under the name Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. Since its incorporation, Neptune has amended its articles of incorporation on numerous occasions. The Company first amended its articles on May 30, 2000 to convert its then issued and outstanding shares into newly-created classes of shares. The Company’s articles were also amended on May 31, 2000 to create Series A Preferred Shares. On August 29, 2000, the Company converted all its issued and outstanding Class A shares into Class B subordinate shares. On September 25, 2000, the Company further amended its share capital to eliminate its Class A shares and converted its Class B subordinate shares into Common Shares. On November 1, 2013, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reflect certain changes to items relating to board matters. The Company’s Common Shares are listed and posted for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol, “NEPT”.
 On June 9, 2022, we effected a one for thirty five (1-for-35) reverse split of our common shares, which we refer to as the “Share Consolidation,” as approved by our Board of Directors. Trading of our common shares on both the TSX and NASDAQ on a post-consolidated basis commenced as of the open of markets on June 13, 2022.
 OUR PROPERTIES AND OPERATIONS
Our headquarters is located in leased offices in Laval, Québec, where our general and administrative departments primarily operate. We also lease laboratory space in Laval, Quebec where testing and development of many of our products takes place. We lease offices in Jupiter, Florida which will serve as the U.S. headquarters once leasehold improvements are completed which is expected to be in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.
We own a production facility in Sherbrooke, Quebec where we conduct our cannabis operations including laboratory testing. On June 8, 2022, we announced the planned accelerated divestiture of our cannabis business which would include the sale of our cannabis brands and the Sherbrooke building in one or more transactions.
We also lease a production facility in Conover, North Carolina and have leased offices in Vaudreuil, Province of Québec, Canada and leased offices in Montvale, New Jersey. All of these facilities are unoccupied. The Conover facility housed our SugarLeaf operations, and we are in the process of selling the remaining equipment and prepare the building to be returned to the lessor in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023. The Vaudreuil offices were previously used for the Company’s Biodroga business. The Montvale offices previously served as the headquarters for Sprout. The Company is attempting to sub-lease the Vaudreuil and Montvale offices.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Neptune’s vision is to change consumer habits through the creation and distribution of environmentally friendly, ethical and innovative consumer product goods. Our mission is to redefine health and wellness and help humanity thrive by providing sustainable consumer focused solutions. Despite the decline in global economic activity since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, Neptune has taken transformative, and successful, actions to increase its sales, distribution and reach in both the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) model in the consumer-packaged goods (“CPG”) market. Neptune has a dual go-to market B2B and B2C strategy focused on expanding its global distribution reach. The strategy sets Neptune apart from its competition and has started to yield consistent, long-term revenue opportunities for the Company.
The Company's long-term strategy is focused on the health and wellness sector with an emphasis on select CPG verticals, including Nutraceuticals, Beauty & Personal Care, and Organic Foods & Beverages. Neptune's current brand portfolio across these verticals include Sprout®, Neptune Wellness, Forest Remedies®, and MaxSimil®.
On June 9, 2021, Neptune announced a multi-year licensing agreement between Sprout and CoComelon, the world's leading children's entertainment brand, owned and operated by Moonbug Entertainment. In addition, on July 27, 2021, an initial launch was announced for Sprout products into Canada, in Metro grocery stores in the province of Ontario.
Neptune’s future will be focused on brand creation, accelerating organic growth with emphasis on increased efficiency and margin expansion. This will be complimented by accretive acquisitions with a proven track record of operational excellence. On July 22, 2021, the Company launched Forest Remedies’ plant-based Omega 3-6-9 gummies and soft gels. Neptune is focused on expanding its exclusive Omega-3 delivery technology MaxSimil® while improving growth and profitability in its Nutraceuticals vertical. The MaxSimil® product lineup will be expanded with the launch of two new consumer products: MaxSimil® with CoQ10 and MaxSimil® with Curcumin. Additionally, the Company launched a new consumer line of Vitamin Sprays and Pumps for both children and adults with selected retail partners. To support anticipated accelerated growth, the Nutraceuticals U.S. sales force has been expanded to maximize awareness and distribution of the capabilities and expertise in CBD formulation, prebiotics and probiotics, and proteins within this important vertical.
PRODUCTS, PRINCIPAL MARKETS, METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION AND BRANDS
 Products
 Our Nutraceutical, Beauty and Personal care products and Organic Foods and Beverages are manufactured by third party manufacturers. In order to meet demand for our products, we have developed relationships with selected contract manufacturers. We believe that we are not dependent on any single contract manufacturer and that, if necessary, our current selected contract manufacturers could be replaced with minimal disruption to our operations.
We currently purchase raw materials for the manufacturing of our products from suppliers recognized for their quality and consistency. Our quality control staff requires full disclosure on the part of our suppliers and we periodically conduct on-site audits of their facilities. For strategic reasons, certain of our key raw materials are sourced from single suppliers. However, in the event that we were unable to source an ingredient from a current supplier, we believe that we could generally obtain the same ingredient or an equivalent from an alternative supplier, with minimal disruption to our operations.
Canadian Cannabis Products - Extracts and Formulations
 We retrofitted our existing production facility located in Sherbrooke, Province of Québec, Canada to comply with Health Canada requirements under the Cannabis Act, in order to produce our cannabis extracts and formulations at our existing site. Our GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices, mandated by the Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada) production facility features robust safety measures and equipment, which allows for enhanced manufacturing practices. We also operate a laboratory at our facility, which allows us to conduct research, new product development and quality control analysis in-house.

As a condition for obtaining our license to produce cannabis oil under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada required multiple compliance measures to be taken, including the addition of physical barriers, visual monitoring, recording devices, intrusion detection, as well as other important controls around access to the Company’s existing Sherbrooke facility.
On June 8, 2022, the Company announced a planned accelerated divestiture of the Canadian cannabis business including the sale of our cannabis brands and the Sherbrooke building in one or more transactions.
MARKETS
Nutraceuticals
Neptune offers a variety of specialty ingredients, including our licensed specialty ingredient MaxSimil®, a technology that helps increase digestion and absorption of fat-soluble and nutritional ingredients. Additionally, the Company sources a variety of other marine oils, seed oils and specialty ingredients that are available for sale as raw material or transformed into finished products. The Company has recently launched a new line of Vitamin Sprays and Pumps for both children and adults. Neptune is focused on expanding its exclusive Omega-3 delivery technology MaxSimil® while improving growth and profitability in its Nutraceuticals vertical through its brand Biodroga.
 Neptune’s core strength is product innovation with a focus on specialty ingredients offered in bulk soft gels and liquid delivery systems. The Company continues to expand its delivery system capabilities with projects for pumps, sprays, roll-ons and CBD enhancements. All of Neptune’s Nutraceutical products are available under distributors’ private labels, primarily sold in the Canadian and U.S. nutraceutical markets. Neptune, through its nutraceuticals products business, also formulates, develops and provides customers with turnkey nutrition solutions.
 Beauty & Personal Care
The Company sells wellness products to the Beauty & Personal Care market through its Forest Remedies brand. Forest Remedies offers plant-based supplements, including first-of-its kind multi-omega gummies and soft gels with packaging that is 100% plastic-free. Neptune announced, on March 10, 2022, the launch of its Forest Remedies Multi Omega 3-6-9 line of supplements into more than 340 Sprouts Farmers Market stores across the U.S. This distribution agreement marks another important milestone in our efforts to transform Neptune into a high-growth branded CPG company.
Organic Foods and Beverages
 In February 2021, Neptune acquired a controlling interest in Sprout Foods, Inc., an organic plant-based baby food and toddler snack company. Sprout is an integral piece of Neptune’s health and wellness portfolio and represents a key brand within the Organic Foods and Beverages vertical. Since completing the Sprout acquisition, the Company has begun expansion efforts in Sprout’s distribution across substantially all of Target’s U.S. retail stores. The Company also announced, on July 27, 2021, the initial launch of Sprout products into Canada, in Metro grocery stores in the province of Ontario. Neptune further expects to launch Sprout products in North America throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. The Company expects the Neptune/Sprout combination to result in significant incremental revenue growth, with several near and long-term revenue synergy opportunities identified within Neptune’s existing relationships and current sales channels. As described above, Neptune also announced on June 9, 2021, an exclusive multi-year licensing agreement between Sprout and CoComelon, the #1 children’s entertainment and educational show in the world with more than 110 million subscribers worldwide. We expect to announce product availability and provide additional information about the rollout of CoComelon licensed products in the near future.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Nutraceutical Products
 The Company sells its nutraceutical products mainly in bulk softgels or liquids to multiple distributors and customers, who commercialize these products under their private label. While the Company may have orders in place with approximately 100 different distributors and customers at any one time, the majority of the Company’s sales are concentrated with a small group of distributors and customers. Agreements with these distribution partners may be terminated or altered by them unilaterally in certain circumstances.
Beauty & Personal Care
 The Company sells its Beauty and Personal Care products through distributors and directly to retail outlets in the United States. It also sells its products online through its own website forestremedies.com as well as e-commerce sites.
Organic Foods and Beverages
 The Company, though its Sprout subsidiary, sells its products to mass retailers, grocery stores and other retail outlets, as well as online through e-commerce sites and its own website sproutorganics.com.
OUR B2C BRAND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY
 We are currently working on accelerating brand equity for our brand portfolio:

Biodroga. Neptune, through its Biodroga subsidiary, provides product development and turnkey solutions (4PL) to its customers throughout North America. Biodroga offers a full range of services, whether it is leveraging our global network of suppliers to find the best ingredients or developing unique formulations that set our customer apart from their competition. Biodroga’s core products are MaxSimil, various Omega-3 fish oils and a line of CBD enhanced products, as well as softgel solutions. 
MaxSimil. Neptune’s patented MaxSimil is an omega-3 fatty acid delivery technology that uses enzymes that mimic the natural human digestive system to predigest omega-3 fatty acids. The Journal of Nutrition by the Oxford University Press, recently released the results of a clinical study that evidences MaxSimil’s superior absorption as compared with standard fish oil supplements. MaxSimil was first introduced to the market in 2018, and is sold as a straight omega-3 supplement with standard and unique concentration of EPA/DHA. MaxSimil is also starting to be presented in combination with specialty ingredients such as Curcumin, Vitamin K2 and CBD. 
Forest Remedies®. Under our Forest Remedies® brand, we offer first-of-their kind vegan multi-omega gummies and soft gels with packaging that is 100% plastic-free. Launched on March 10, 2022, our Forest Remedies Multi Omega 3-6-9 line of supplements is available into more than 340 Sprouts Farmers Market stores across the U.S. This distribution agreement marks another important milestone in our efforts to transform Neptune into a high-growth branded CPG company. 
Sprout®. Neptune entered a new market with the Neptune/Sprout combination. Sprout has created a trusted organic baby food brand with a comprehensive range of products that are always USDA certified organic, non-GMO and contain nothing artificial. Sprout’s products target four segments: Stage 2 (children 6 months and up), Stage 3 (children 8 months and up), Toddler (children aged 12 months and up) and Snacks (children 8 months and up). Since our acquisition of a controlling interest in Sprout, the Company has begun expansion efforts in Sprouts’ distribution substantially in all of Target’s U.S. retail stores. The Company also announced on July 27, 2021, its initial launch into the Canadian market through its partnership with food retailer Metro Inc. Certain toddler snacks under this brand label are now available in Metro grocery stores in the province of Ontario. 

COMPETITION
 The nutraceutical, beauty & personal care and organic foods and beverages industries are highly competitive. There are many companies, public and private universities, and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our products. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products similar to our products will increase. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products.
 We seek to differentiate our products and marketing from our competitors based on product quality, customer service, marketing support, pricing and innovation, and believe that our strategy enables us to effectively compete in the marketplace. For additional information regarding the competitive nature of our businesses, see “Risks Related to Our Business” under the heading “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.


REGULATORY
 Our Nutraceutical, Beauty, Personal Care and Organic Food and Beverage businesses are subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in Canada and the U.S., including Health Canada, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various provincial, state and local agencies in areas where we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business. The areas of our business regulated by both these and other authorities include, among others:
 •product claims and advertising;
•product labels;
•product ingredients;
•how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products; and
•our classification as an essential business and our right to continue operations during government shutdowns.
Health Canada and the FDA, in particular, regulate the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in Canada and the U.S., while other agencies regulate marketing and advertising claims. Under Health Canada and FDA rules, companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements are required to meet certain GMP’s to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by Health Canada and the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the mandated GMP.
Health Canada and he FDA also regulate the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following:
•the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling;
•requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support;
•labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made;
•notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and
•premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in Canada and the U.S., including those relating to health, safety, bioterrorism, taxes, labor, employment, import and export, the environment and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so or that being in compliance will not become prohibitively costly to our business.
Cannabis Regulatory Framework
 On June 8, 2022, we announced the planned accelerated divestiture of our cannabis business including the sale of our brands as well as the Sherbrooke building in one or more transactions.
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act (Canada) and the Cannabis Regulations came into force in Canada, legalizing the sale of cannabis for adult recreational use. Prior to the promulgation of the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations, only the sale of cannabis for medical purposes was legal, which was regulated by the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (“CDSA”). The Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations replaced the CDSA and the ACMPR as the governing laws and regulations in respect of the production, processing, sale and distribution of cannabis for medical and adult recreational use.
 The Cannabis Regulations, among other things, set out regulations relating to the following matters: (1) licences, permits and authorizations; (2) security clearances and physical security measures; (3) good production practices; (4) cannabis products; (5) packaging and labelling; (6) cannabis for medical purposes; (7) drugs containing cannabis; (8) combination products and devices; (9) importation and exportation for medical or scientific purposes; (10) document retention; and (11) reporting and disclosure.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We constantly evaluate the importance of obtaining intellectual property protection for our technology brands, products, applications and processes and maintaining trade secrets. When applicable to our business and products, we seek to obtain, license and enforce patents, protect our proprietary information and maintain trade secret protection without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We also make use of trade secrets, proprietary unpatented information and trademarks to protect our technology and enhance our competitive position.
 Brand Names and Trademarks
Mood Ring, PanHash, Sprout®, NurturMe®, Nosh!®, Neptune Wellness, MaxSimil®, Forest Remedies®, and Ocean Remedies® are trademarks of the Company. On June 8, 2022 we announced the planned accelerated divestiture of our cannabis business including the sale of our Cannabis Brands, Mood Ring and PanHash, as well as the Sherbrooke building in one or more transactions
 Patent Applications
On August 9, 2018, Neptune filed two applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for patents related to the extraction of cannabis material. The extraction processes provide highly-efficient methods to obtain cannabinoids and other desired compounds from the cannabis plant at a greater purity than conventional methods. Both processes are applicable to marijuana and hemp and have been incorporated into the Company’s GMP-certified extraction facility in Sherbrooke. The first patent application outlines a method of extracting and isolating compounds from plants of the Cannabis genus at low temperature by using a cold organic solvent. The second patent application similarly provides for a method for extracting compounds from cannabis at low temperature, but without the use of organic solvents. Specifically, this patent relates to a process for high recovery of cannabinoids and terpenes by using natural solvents.
Licenses
 On November 27, 2017, Neptune entered into an exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-bearing licensing agreement for the use of the MaxSimil® technology, in combination with cannabis-derived products. This new agreement allows Neptune to research, manufacture, formulate, distribute, and sell monoglyceride omega-3-rich ingredients in combination with cannabis and/or cannabinoid-rich or hemp derived ingredients for medical and adult use applications. The Company believes the MaxSimil® technology has the ability to enhance absorption of lipidbased and lipid soluble ingredients such as cannabinoids, essential fatty acids including EPA and DHA omega-3s, vitamins A, D, K and E, CoQ10 and others. This could be especially beneficial in increasing the absorption of ingredients which are not easily absorbed, such as CBD.
On June 9, 2021, Sprout Foods entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with Moonbug, providing Sprout with an exclusive license to utilize certain properties relating to CoComelon®, the world's leading children's entertainment brand, owned and operated by Moonbug, with Sprout products.
 EMPLOYEES
As of March 31, 2022, we had 161 employees working at our business offices in Laval , at our facility in Sherbrooke or remotely. Our employees possess specialized skills and knowledge in the following fields, which we believe are valuable assets of the Company. 7 of our employees occupy executive management positions while 29 were employed in research, laboratory and quality, 8 were in sales and market and 40 were in production and administration. As of March 31, 2022, 124 of our employees were in Canada while 37 were in the United States. We also had 10 temporary personnel. Seven of our employees were represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and our operations have never been interrupted as the result of a labor dispute.
SEASONALITY
 In addition to general economic factors, we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and other unpredictable matters. Although we believe the impact or seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal, our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future due to the timing of nutraceutical contract manufacturing orders as well promotions and ordering patterns of our other customers. We cannot provide assurance future revenues will follow historical patterns. The market price of our common shares may be adversely affected by these factors.
BUSINESS UPDATE
 Financial Positioning
 We are taking the steps necessary to shore up cash reserves in the immediate term and position our balance sheet properly to fund our growth initiatives as we push towards profitability. To this end, we have explored multiple options to balance the need for providing near-term financial stability while ensuring we continue to build long-term shareholder value. As a result, we have entered into two agreements for the purchase and sale of shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants. Taking into account all considerations, we believe these actions are in the best interest of the company and will benefit shareholders in the long-term. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Going Concern. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are in US dollars ("USD").
Closing of a $8,000,000 Registered Direct Offering
 On March 14, 2022, Neptune announced that it had closed a registered direct offering with a single strategic consumer-focused institutional investor for the purchase and sale of (i) 528,572 common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") and (ii) 185,714 pre-funded warrants (the "Pre-Funded Warrants"), with each Pre-Funded Warrant exercisable for one Common Share. The Common Shares and the Pre-Funded Warrants were sold together with Series A Warrants (the "Series A Warrants") to purchase up to an aggregate of 714,286 Common Shares and Series B Warrants (the "Series B Warrants" and collectively with the Series A Warrants, the "Common Warrants") to purchase up to an aggregate of 714,286 Common Shares. Each Common Share and the accompanying Common Warrants were sold together at a combined offering price of $11.20, and each Pre-funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrants were sold together at a combined offering price of $11.20 , for aggregate gross proceeds of $8.0 million before deducting fees and other offering expenses. The Pre-Funded Warrants are funded in full at closing except for a nominal exercise price of $0.0035 and were exercisable commencing on the closing date. The Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $11.20 per share and are exercisable six months after the closing date, and will expire five and one half years from the date of issuance. The Series B Warrants have an exercise price of $11.20 per share and are exercisable six months after the closing date, and expire 18 months from the closing date (collectively the "March Offering"). The Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in full on March 29, 2022 for gross proceeds of $650.
Closing of a $5,000,000 Registered Direct Offering Priced At-The-Market Under Nasdaq Rules
 On June 23, 2022, Neptune announced that it had closed a registered direct offering with certain institutional investors for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 1,945,526 common shares (or common share equivalents) of the Company, and accompanying two series of warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,891,052 common shares per series of warrants, at an offering price of $2.57 per share and accompanying warrants in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. Each series of warrants have an exercise price of $2.32 per share and are immediately exercisable upon issuance. One series of warrants will expire two years following the date of issuance and one series of warrants will expire five years following the date of issuance, for aggregate gross proceeds of $5 million before deducting fees and other offering expenses. The pre-funded warrants issued in the offering were fully exercised on June 24, 2022 for $64.55.
 Growth Drivers
We remain enthusiastic about the growth prospects of our business, with opportunity across all three of our core verticals. We have successfully made the transition to a fully-integrated consumer packaged goods company with a diverse suite of better-for-you brands, available in some of the country's largest retail chains. At the same time, we are driving consumer relevance by pursuing the right strategic partnerships for co-branded product lines and expanding our product offerings in key wellness categories.
Major Distribution Gains
Since acquiring a majority stake in Sprout Organics in February 2021 , we have expanded Sprout baby foods and toddler snacks substantially, both online and in store at major retailers like Target and Wal-Mart. Earlier in March 2022, we announced the launch of our Forest Remedies Multi Omega 3-6-9 line of supplements into more than 340 Sprouts Farmers Market stores across the U.S. This distribution agreement marks another important milestone in our efforts to transform Neptune into a high-growth branded CPG company.
Strategic Partnerships
 In February 2022, we brought Walmart a first-of-its-kind collaboration between Sprout Organics and popular kids' entertainment platform CoComelon. This co-branded product line is now available on Walmart.com and in 900 Walmart stores next month, and has been very well-received. With this launch, Sprout Organics now sells into the top organic baby food retailers in the U.S., accounting for approximately 90 percent of the overall market.
 Investing in Our Prospects
On November 15, 2021 we initiated a strategic review and made some big changes to get on track to becoming a profitable diversified CPG company. These actions have taken effect, and we are starting to see the results. The third quarter of fiscal year 2022 was the first quarter where we posted a positive gross margins since transitioning to a CPG-focused model. We also delivered four consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth before a decrease in the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2022.
We expect these positive trends to continue in fiscal year 2023. We are very excited about what the future holds for Neptune Wellness, and we are putting our money where our mouth is. Neptune's executive management team, including the Board, recently completed the purchase of more than one million common shares in the public market, reinforcing our confidence in the direction we're headed.
 While the global market can be unstable during turbulent times, we are taking steps to ensure we remain well-positioned to execute against our stated plan: controlling our costs while pursuing high-growth opportunities. To that effect, Neptune announced on June 8, 2022 the launch of a new Consumer Packaged Goods ("CPG") focused strategic plan to reduce costs, improve the Company's path to profitability and enhance current shareholder value. This plan focuses on two primary actions: (1) planned accelerated divestiture of the Canadian cannabis business and (2) a realignment of focus and operational resources toward increasing the value of Neptune's consumer products business. With the planned divestiture of its cannabis business, Neptune is renewing its focus on the core brands – Sprout Organics and Biodroga Solutions – that align closely with future consumer trends and show a greater potential for future growth and profitability.
The intended divestiture of the cannabis business would include the sale of the Mood Ring and PanHash brands, along with the Company's Sherbrooke, Quebec facility, in one or more transactions. The value of the facility was recently appraised at $21 million CAD by a third-party appraisal company. Neptune has retained Stifel GMP to support the divestiture efforts, with a focus on maximizing the value to Neptune shareholders. In order to accelerate its cost savings, the Company will focus on winding up its cannabis operations pending a transaction. This planned action is intended to provide significant cost savings and help maximize operational efficiencies, resulting in a 50% reduction in workforce, over 30% reduction of total payroll costs and an estimated annual cost savings of $5.8 million CAD. In addition, the Company expects to see additional cost savings from corresponding reductions in corporate overhead costs and professional fees.
Finally, the exit of the Canadian cannabis business may impact the amount and structure of financing the company is currently seeking. It is expected to reduce the amount of financing the Company seeks, given a lower anticipated expense structure, along with anticipated cash inflows from the planned divestiture. Additionally, the divestiture is expected to facilitate working with a broader set of financing sources – including traditional banks and financial institutions that have policies restricting dealing with businesses exposed to regulated cannabis operation
RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
 Neptune’s Presence in Canada’s Cannabis Market
 During the year ended on March 31, 2022, Neptune supplied the market with premium cannabis extracts and dried flower, under its Mood Ring and PanHash brands, and completed its launch of all significant regulated product categories. All cannabis products were manufactured and packaged at the Company’s purpose-built facility in Sherbrooke, Quebec. On June 8, 2022, the Company announced a planned accelerated divestiture of the Canadian cannabis business and the Company will focus on winding up its cannabis operations pending one or more sales transactions.
Mood Ring
 The Mood Ring brand and product line were launched last fiscal year to meet consumer demand for high-quality, affordable and environmentally friendly cannabis products. Mood Ring leverages Neptune’s decades of experience in the wellness, extraction and consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) industries to bring product offerings to market that are designed to meet the specific demands of Canadian consumers. Mood Ring uses Neptune’s proprietary and patented cold ethanol extraction process technology for the Company’s vape, capsule, oil/tincture and concentrate products. This process allow Mood Ring to provide consumers with all of the cannabinoid and terpene benefits of the plant with a significantly lower environmental impact, requiring significantly less energy use when compared to CO2 extraction. With the March 2021 sales amendment Neptune is also authorized to sell dried flower, and pre-rolls, of which both form factors were launched under the Mood Ring brand later in 2021.
British Columbia
 As of March 31, 2022 Neptune had launched a total of eight Mood Ring branded cannabis products in the province of British Columbia. These products include, but are not limited to, Mood Ring’s first dried flower offering, Florida Citrus Kush, along with Mood Ring’s first two vape cartridge offerings – Jack Flash and Pure Kush. Based on the success of Mood Ring’s High CBD Capsule and Oil products launched in 2020, line extensions were launched in 2021 with both High THC Capsules and High THC Oil launching in June 2021.
Ontario
 The Company entered into a supply agreement on October 27, 2020 with the Ontario Cannabis Store (“OCS”), the wholesaler and sole online retailer for recreational cannabis, for the sale and distribution of Neptune’s new proprietary recreational product line, Mood Ring. Ontario is Canada’s largest market for adult-use cannabis products. The agreement authorizes Neptune to supply Mood Ring products to the OCS for sale and wholesale distribution. Mood Ring products have been available for purchase since February 22, 2021 through the OCS online store, and is available to licensed private retailers in Ontario. As of March 31, 2022 Neptune had launched a total of nine Mood Ring branded products in Ontario, including products from every form factor produced by Neptune, including but not limited to, dried flower, pre-rolls and vape cartridges.
Quebec (PanHashTM)
 Near the end of fiscal year 2021, Neptune announced it entered into a letter of intent with Société québécoise du cannabis (“SQDC”), the province’s sole legal retailer for recreational cannabis, for the sale of Neptune’s new cannabis brand, PanHash, exclusively for the Province of Quebec. The initial PanHash launch consisted of two products with a high concentration of CBD: cannabis oil and capsules which was increased to a total of eight products by March 31, 2022, including PanHash’s first dried flower offering, Artisanal Golden Berry.

 Neptune Completes its Strategic Transition from Extraction to Consumer Packaged Goods
 In April 2021, Neptune completed its transition from revenue derived from hemp and cannabis extraction to revenue from consumer packaged goods and branded products, such as Mood Ring — an end-to-end developed and manufactured cannabinoid-based product portfolio targeting both wellness-focused CBD consumers looking for natural products, and the recreational market with multiple high THC products.
On June 8, 2022, Neptune announced that the launch of a new Consumer Packaged Goods ("CPG") focused strategic plan to reduce costs, improve the Company's path to profitability and enhance current shareholder value. This plan builds on the Company's initial strategic review that took place in fall of 2021 and focuses on two primary actions: (1) planned accelerated divestiture of the Canadian cannabis business and (2) a realignment of focus and operational resources toward increasing the value of Neptune's consumer products business. With the planned divestiture of its cannabis business, Neptune is renewing its focus on the core brands – Sprout Organics and Biodroga Solutions – that align closely with future consumer trends and show a greater potential for future growth and profitability. The strategic plan is expected to lower costs and reduce global headcount by approximately 50%.

Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s common shares for the 30 consecutive business days from July 16, 2021, to August 27, 2021, the Company no longer met the minimum bid price requirement.
 The Notification Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common shares on Nasdaq.
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until February 28, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, during which time the Company’s common shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To regain compliance, the Company’s common shares must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. The Company has requested and received an additional 180-day period to regain compliance, and now has until August 27, 2022 to comply.

The Share Consolidation reduced the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding from approximately 198 million Common Shares to approximately 5.7 million Common Shares as at June 13, 2022.
