In recent years, the Company has been evolving its business model to focus on building out a residential and C&I ecosystem of energy technology products, solutions, and services.  As part of this evolution, we have made significant investments into rapidly growing new markets such as residential clean energy storage, solar microinverters, and energy monitoring & management devices, all of which are distributed energy resources (DERs) that can be aggregated into virtual power plants (VPPs) within grid services programs. In addition, a key strategic focus has been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators to expand into applications beyond standby power, allowing us to participate in Energy-as-a-Service and microgrid projects for commercial and industrial applications.
 
We have also made investments in next-generation platforms and controls for both residential and C&I applications that facilitate the connection of our products to the grid. Expanding these capabilities will enable the increasing utilization of our equipment as DERs as the nascent market for grid services expands over the next several years. Our growing presence in grid services programs will enhance the value of our power generation and storage products that might otherwise sit idle, as they are now able to be dispatched and orchestrated as part of a distributed energy solution, thereby generating additional return-on-investment for the home or business owner while also delivering value to utilities and energy retailers by helping to balance, support and enhance the reliability of the electrical grid.  As the traditional centralized utility model evolves over time, we believe that a more decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized grid infrastructure will build-out, and Generac's energy technology solutions are uniquely and strategically positioned to participate in this next-generation grid referred to as "Grid 2.0".
 
As our traditional power generation markets continue to grow due to multiple mega-trends that are driving increased penetration of our products, we believe we are in an excellent position to execute on this opportunity given our competitive strengths.  In addition, our focus on more resilient, efficient and sustainable energy solutions has dramatically increased our served addressable market, and as a result, we believe that Generac is well-positioned for success over the long term. 
 
Company History
 
Generac was founded in 1959 to commercialize a line of affordable portable generators that offered superior performance and features. The Company’s success through the years has been built upon engineering expertise, manufacturing excellence and our innovative approaches to the market. This has driven our growth into becoming a leading provider of power equipment for a variety of applications within residential, commercial, and industrial markets.
 
In 1980, we expanded beyond portable generators into the industrial power generation market with the introduction of our first stationary generators that provided up to 200kW of power output. We introduced our first residential standby generator in 1989 and expanded our industrial product offering and global distribution system in the 1990s, forming a series of alliances that rapidly increased our sales. Our growth accelerated in the 2000’s as we expanded our purpose-built line of residential & commercial automatic standby generators and implemented our multilayered, omni-channel distribution philosophy. Throughout the 2000’s, a number of high-profile power outage events also helped to increase the awareness and need for back-up power and home standby generators. In 2006, the founder of Generac sold the company to affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, together with certain other investors and members of our management. In February 2010, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock.
 
Soon after going public, we implemented our “Powering Ahead” enterprise strategy. This strategic plan accelerated the Company’s transition from primarily a North America focused, emergency backup generator company into a more diversified industrial technology company with the addition of new and adjacent product categories and an expanded global presence, primarily through a series of acquisitions. In 2018, we transitioned into a new enterprise strategy called “Powering Our Future”, which drove further share gains in new and existing markets, capitalized on Generac’s leadership in natural gas, established our connectivity strategy, and provided the initial foundation for the Company’s evolution into an energy technology solutions company, including some key initial acquisitions within the residential clean energy space. This ultimately led to the introduction of our new “Powering A Smarter World” enterprise strategy in 2021.  This current strategic plan continues the evolution of Generac’s business model that pairs traditional and emerging power generation and storage technologies with new monitoring, management and grid services capabilities to provide solutions for the dynamic challenges presented by today’s energy landscape.

Commercial & Industrial Products
 
We offer a full line of C&I generators that are increasingly being fueled by cleaner sources of energy such as natural gas, liquid propane, and Bi-Fuel™, as well as other more traditional fuels such as diesel. We believe we have one of the broadest product offerings in the industry with power outputs ranging from 10kW up to 3,250kW. Through the Deep Sea acquisition in 2021, we have expanded our capabilities in the design and manufacture of advanced controls for a range of energy technology C&I applications, such as microgrids and Energy-as-a-Service. Our natural gas C&I stationary generators have Smart Grid Ready capabilities, enabling our customers to contribute to grid resiliency and generate an incremental return on investment by connecting and enrolling their generator as a distributed energy resource used in grid services applications where available. We believe as more grid services programs roll-out over time, we will be able to sell more equipment given the improved economics and value of our generators as DER’s.
 
Our light-commercial standby generators and related transfer switches include a full range of affordable systems from 22kW to 150kW, providing three-phase power sufficient for most small and mid-sized businesses such as grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, retail banks, small health care facilities and other small-footprint retail applications. Our light-commercial generators predominantly run on cleaner-burning fuels such as natural gas and liquid propane.
 
We design and manufacture a broad product line of modelized and configured stationary generators and related transfer switches for various industrial standby, continuous-duty, and prime rated applications. Our single-engine industrial generators range in output from 10kW up to 3,250kW, include stationary and containerized packages, and can include our Modular Power Systems (MPS) technology that extends our product range up to much larger multi-megawatt systems through an integrated paralleling configuration. Over the past several years, we have introduced larger and higher-powered gaseous-fueled generators, with the highest output of 1,000kW for a single-engine set. Our industrial standby generators are primarily used as emergency backup for larger applications in the healthcare, telecom, datacom, commercial office, retail, municipal and manufacturing markets. In recent years, we've had a strategic effort aimed at utilizing our gaseous-fueled generators in "beyond standby" applications including distributed generation and microgrid projects and have developed purpose-built products for these applications that have grid-connected capability. The addition of Smart Grid Ready functionality and the significant expansion of our in-house advanced controls capabilities further enhances the potential utilization of our generators in these applications.
 
Our MPS technology combines the power of several smaller generators to produce the output of a larger generator, providing our customers with redundancy and scalability in a cost-effective manner. For larger industrial applications, our MPS products offer customers an efficient, affordable way to scale their standby power needs, while offering superior reliability given their built-in redundancy which allows individual units to be taken off-line for routine maintenance while retaining coverage for critical circuits.
 
We also offer a full line of industrial transfer switches to meet varying needs from light industrial applications all the way up to the most demanding critical installations. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly increased and upgraded our industrial transfer switch product offering, which we believe will help to enhance our attachment rate and related market share for these products. Generac’s innovative feature set and flexible platforms offer a variety of switching technologies for customized solutions to meet any project needs.
 
We also provide a broad product line of light towers, mobile generators, and mobile energy storage systems, which provide temporary lighting and power for various end markets, such as road and commercial construction, energy, mining, military, and special events. These products are typically sold to national and regional rental companies who then rent the equipment to the end user. We believe the addition of mobile energy storage systems obtained through our acquisition of Off Grid Energy in 2021 will enable us to capture share of the rapidly expanding Battery Energy Storage System (or BESS) market in the future. Also in 2021, we unveiled a hybrid mobile solution that pairs an energy storage system with a diesel generator to reduce emissions and noise pollution, as well as a mobile battery-powered light tower, both of which we expect will come to market during 2022. We also manufacture commercial mobile pumps and dust-suppression equipment for a wide variety of applications, as well as various gaseous-engine control systems and accessories, which are sold to gas-engine manufacturers and aftermarket customers.
 
C&I products comprised 26.7%, 28.3% and 39.5%, respectively, of total net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Mega-Trends, Strategic Growth Themes, and Additional Business Drivers
 
During 2021, we unveiled our new “Powering A Smarter World” strategic plan, which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to capitalize on the long-term growth prospects of Generac. Our enterprise strategy is based on the combination of several key mega-trends that we believe will drive several significant strategic growth themes for our business.
 
Key Mega-Trends: 
 

● | “Grid 2.0”: which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model, includes the decarbonization, digitization, and decentralization of the grid and a migration toward distributed energy resources that is expected to drive demand for a variety of clean energy and grid services solutions going forward.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attitudes around global warming and climate change are shifting: which includes the expectation of more volatile and severe weather driving increased power outage activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natural gas is expected to be an important fuel of the future: with the abundance of supply globally leading to increasing demand for natural gas generators and applications beyond standby power.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Legacy infrastructure needs a major investment cycle: to rebuild and upgrade aging networks and systems including transportation, water and power.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Telecommunications infrastructure shifting to next generation: which involves the “5G” architecture that will enable new technologies requiring significant improvement in network uptime through backup power solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home as a Sanctuary: since the onset of the COVID pandemic in early 2020 millions of people are working, learning, shopping, entertaining, aging in place, and generally spending more time at home. As a result, homeowners are becoming increasingly more sensitive to power outages due to lost productivity and functionality. These trends combined with ongoing elevated power outage activity has led to significantly increased awareness regarding the importance and need for backup power security. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Growth Themes:
 
Power quality issues continue to increase.  Power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness for back-up power and have historically influenced demand for generators, both in the United States and internationally. Increased frequency and duration of major power outage events, that have a broader impact beyond a localized level, increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period, which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major outage event for standby generators. Energy storage systems offer similar resiliency advantages to consumers and can benefit from these same awareness drivers, at least for short duration power outages. The optional standby market for C&I power generation is also driven by power quality issues and the related need for back up power. Baseline outage activity in each of the past five years has been above the long-term average as climate change has driven an increase in severe weather activity, while an aging and underinvested electrical grid infrastructure remains highly vulnerable to such activity. Additionally, rapid growth in renewable power sources such as solar and wind is resulting in increased intermittency of supply, further impairing the reliable supply of electricity at a time when demand is starting to increase meaningfully with the electrification of a wide range of consumer and commercial products, including transportation, HVAC systems, and other major appliances. Further, in California, Public Safety Power Shutoff events are taking place whereby public utilities are turning off power supply to their customers under certain circumstances to prevent their transmission equipment from starting wildfires. Taken together, we expect these factors to continue driving increased awareness of the need for backup power and demand for Generac’s products within multiple categories.
 
    6 

  

Home standby penetration opportunity is significant.  Many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions. With only approximately 5.5% penetration of the addressable market of homes in the United States (which we define as single-family detached, owner-occupied households with a home value of over $125,000, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Housing Survey for the United States), we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally. We believe by expanding our distribution network, continuing to develop our product lines, and targeting our marketing efforts, we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our home standby generators. Additionally, Smart Grid Ready capabilities have the potential to turn an asset previously utilized only in emergency power outage situations into a source of recurring revenue for the homeowner and a contributor to grid stability for utilities and grid operators, therefore driving incremental interest in the product category.
 
Solar, storage, and monitoring markets developing quickly.  During 2019, we entered the rapidly developing energy storage, monitoring and management markets with the introduction of PWRcell™ and PWRview™. In 2021, we expanded our capabilities in the residential solar market with the introduction of the PWRmicro, a grid-interactive microinverter which is expected to be available in 2022.  In addition, we believe ecobee’s technologies combined with Generac’s product offering will allow us to create a clean, efficient, and reliable home energy ecosystem and platform that will save homeowners money and help grid operators meet the challenges of an electrical grid under increasing stress by providing solutions to better balance supply and demand. We believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead due to rising utility rates, grid instability and power quality issues, environmental concerns, and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries. On-site power generation from renewable sources such as solar and wind, and cleaner-burning natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor, manage, and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity. We expect to further advance our growing capabilities in clean energy by increasing our product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing efforts, as we leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to accelerate our market position in the emerging residential solar, storage, monitoring and management markets.
 
Grid services and Energy-as-a-Service open new revenue streams.  We expect the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model toward decarbonized, digitized, and decentralized solutions will continue to drive the need for grid operators to access and control distributed energy resources (DERs). This will require highly intelligent software platforms that are able to optimize an increasingly complex supply and demand equation, such as our Concerto software platform. As the grid services market matures, Generac will continue to explore new opportunities beyond the traditional software-as-a-service subscription model, including but not limited to the aggregation and sale of power from a fleet of DERs in performance-based contracts, wholesale power market participation, turn-key solutions that combine hardware and software with services, and other monitoring and management services. Additionally, growing interest in our products across a variety of residential and C&I “beyond standby” applications is driving an increase in demand for subscription-like models for end customers, in which Generac will partner with third parties to deliver peace of mind and resiliency solutions while also enabling contributions to grid stability with minimal upfront capital outlays. The significant advancements made in recent years in the connectivity of our products is core to these newer capabilities, which play a key role in the evolution of Generac into an energy technology solutions company.
 
Natural gas generators driving strong growth.  Natural gas will continue to be an important and cleaner transition fuel of the future as the world continues to shift towards lower emission power generation sources. Demand for natural gas generators continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall C&I market, which we believe will continue to grow at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators. We also continue to explore and expand our capabilities within new gaseous generator market opportunities, including continuous-duty, prime rated, distributed generation, demand response, microgrids and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability is needed. Many of these applications are made possible by our natural gas generators having Smart Grid Ready capabilities, which allows for end users to participate in grid services programs, helping to offset the purchase price of the equipment over the product’s lifespan. Expanding our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes is also a part of this growth theme in taking advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators.
 
Rollout of 5G will require improved network quality.  As the number of “connected” devices continues to rapidly increase and wireless networks are now being considered critical infrastructure in the United States, network reliability and up-time are necessary for our increasingly connected society. This will require highly resilient cell tower sites across the network, and therefore necessitates the need for backup power sources on site at these cell towers. Generac is the leading supplier of backup power to the telecommunications market in the United States, where approximately half of all existing tower sites have yet to be hardened with backup power. As more mission-critical data is transmitted over wireless networks, we believe this penetration rate must increase considerably to maintain a higher level of reliability across the network. Increased adoption of high-speed wireless networks around the globe may lead to similar demand trends internationally as growing cell tower density and the need for onsite backup power expand the market opportunity for our international telecom operations. We have relationships with key Tier 1 carriers and tower companies globally in addition to having the distribution partners to support the global market from a service standpoint. We believe these factors coupled with Generac’s ability to customize solutions to each customer’s need help us to maintain our strength within the global telecommunications market.

These trends and market conditions can have a material impact on demand for these products. The capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial, retail, office, telecommunications, industrial, data centers, healthcare, construction, oil & gas and municipal infrastructure, among others. The market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions in the countries where we serve, as well as credit availability in those regions.
 
Enterprise Strategy
 
The mega-trends and strategic growth themes that we have identified help to inform our new enterprise strategy, “Powering A Smarter World,” and our purpose statement, “Leading the evolution to more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions.” As we continue to execute our strategic plan into the future, we are focused on building out residential and C&I ecosystems of connected energy solutions to help address a growing electricity supply/demand imbalance problem by focusing on three key objectives: (i) improve energy resilience and independence, (ii) optimize energy efficiency and consumption, and (iii) protect and build critical infrastructure.  These objectives are further explained as follows:
 
Improve energy resilience and independence. Increase power reliability through onsite generation and storage solutions that provide resiliency for homes, businesses and communities.
 
Homes, businesses, and communities are experiencing a deterioration in the reliable supply of electricity  due to a number of factors including: climate change impacts driving more severe and volatile weather leading to increased power outages; a legacy power infrastructure that’s still predominantly a one-way system that is capacity constrained given heavy reliance on fossil fuels; the power infrastructure still being impaired by underinvestment making it more susceptible to power outages; and regulatory and legislative actions implementing penalties for carbon intensity coupled with incentives for adoption of more intermittent renewable power sources.  Our residential and C&I product offering begins with power generation and storage products including home standby generators, energy storage systems, grid-interactive microinverters, and natural gas C&I generators.  These onsite generation and storage solutions provide peace of mind and protection against rising power quality issues by delivering energy resilience and independence for end users and their communities.  In fact, our new PWRgenerator that was launched in 2021 is a DC generator that is purpose built to charge our PWRcell energy storage system.  With this capability, an end user could conceivably be completely independent from the grid by using sustainable solar energy to power their home, with the PWRgenerator used to recharge the PWRcell should the battery be depleted at certain points of the day. Importantly, many of these onsite solutions come standard as “Smart Grid Ready” capable of participating in grid services programs, which provide additional return on investment opportunities for end users while at the same time helping to support grid reliability, resiliency and sustainability.

Optimize energy efficiency and consumption. Enable sustainable and more efficient power generation and consumption through monitoring, management and lower-carbon solutions.
 
Coinciding with electricity supply reliability issues are a number of factors expected to drive increasing demand for electricity over the next several years. The “electrification of everything” broadly encompasses this global trend, including the electrification of transportation, via both electric vehicle adoption and expanding charging infrastructure, the electrification of the home, including HVAC systems and other appliances, and the electrification of commercial and industrial systems. These global electrification trends will require utilities and energy retailers to meaningfully increase their supply and quality of electricity, while at the same time working to achieve carbon-reduction goals, which is expected to contribute to a further supply/demand imbalance and additional power quality issues.   As part of our expanding ecosystems of energy technology solutions, we continue to build out our residential monitoring and management capabilities, which improve energy efficiency and optimize consumption by end users.  This includes recently adding ecobee’s smart home energy management devices, Apricity’s water heater controllers, and Tank Utility’s propane tank monitoring solutions, along with the introduction of our second-generation load control device called PWRmanager. In the future, we expect to simplify and integrate our residential product offering into a single ecosystem, leveraging our software development capabilities and the substantial resources brought by the ecobee acquisition. This singular system-level platform is intended to serve as the user interface for consumers to monitor and manage all of their DERs, thereby empowering the user to optimize energy efficiency and consumption. Within our global C&I product category, we are developing bi-directional natural gas generators and system-level micro-grid controls that provide the user interface platform for businesses to better optimize their energy efficiency and consumption.
 
Protect and build critical infrastructure. Offering innovative solutions that enable and protect next-generation power, communications, transportation and other critical infrastructure.
 
The critical power infrastructure around the world is becoming more sensitive to the growing electricity supply/demand imbalance. Generac’s suite of solutions can be connected and synchronized within the Concerto distributed energy resource management system, providing utilities and energy retailers the flexibility to access and control these DERs in real-time to better manage the escalating complexities of their electrical grids.  When utilized in these applications, our residential and C&I ecosystems of DERs essentially provide backup power to utilities and energy retailers, enabling the adoption of renewable energy sources by helping solve the intermittency challenges presented by renewable power generation. We believe the next generation of critical power infrastructure will be decarbonized, digitized and decentralized, and we view the implementation, aggregation and management of distributed energy resources as an important aspect to creating the future “Grid 2.0”. Additionally, the rollout of 5G networks globally and the growing consideration of these wireless networks as critical infrastructure makes our backup power solutions for telecommunications applications essential elements of a wireless network that cannot afford to experience power failure. Finally, our broad offering of global mobile solutions, including mobile power products, mobile energy storage systems and hybrid generators, play a key role in the completion of infrastructure construction projects, such as roads, highways, bridges, and airports.
