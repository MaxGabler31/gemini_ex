Item 1. Description of Business
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
 GENERAL
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 2, 2016. The purpose of our business is to provide a web based, round-the-clock, online legal consulting advice service. The service will invite people with legal problems to visit the website at http://glolex-inc.net/ and post legal questions which lawyers, licensed in their jurisdiction, answer with an initial free consultation. The first session is intended to be free of charge to attract new customers, but further consulting services will come with a fee. First free session could involve a phone call or text exchange. We will offer subscription legal plans to link customers with attorneys who partake in our legal plan network.
Anonymity
 
This is intended to be a protected online legal consulting advice service. For very discreet individuals who may wish to receive consulting advice anonymously. If their session is paid for in bitcoin then identity of client remains anonymous, customers will not need to provide their personal details.
 
Our app
 
The second aspect of our business will be a mobile app. This app provides telephone communication with a speaking solicitor who can cite the laws and normative acts selected by the user, and explain their rights within any specified subject matter.  A user enters the application, and selects the subject matter customers rights; then they choose the relevant section and click a key. An attractive lawyer appears on the screen and reads their rights, which may later be downloaded onto their phone/computer as a separate file.
 The second feature of the app will be a lawyer quick search. This is comprehensive list of lawyers and attorneys, in the districts closest to your own location with their area of expertise specified; from housing law to misdemeanors from artistic copyright law to crime. It will also be a useful app for emergencies--for example if you find yourself under arrest but with your one phone call, you could use this app to secure legal representation. This app will be called Backmeup.
 
We intend to engage in business activity but there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing our marketable product.

Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and we havent had any revenue so far. It is possible that wont be able to achieve profitability and we might be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.
