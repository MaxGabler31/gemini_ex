Item 1. Business
Overview
Altimmune, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for obesity and liver diseases. Our lead product candidate, pemvidutide (proposed INN, formerly known as ALT-801), is a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist that is being developed for the treatment of obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). In addition, we are developing HepTcell, an immunotherapeutic agent designed to achieve a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B. 
Our business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene, Inc. (“PharmAthene”) and the business previously known as Altimmune, Inc. (“Private Altimmune”). On May 4, 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene in a series of mergers and reorganizations (collectively, the “Mergers”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “PharmAthene Merger Agreement”) dated January 18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Mustang Merger Sub Corp I Inc. and Mustang Merger Sub II LLC. Upon closing of the Mergers, all equity instruments of Private Altimmune were exchanged for corresponding equity instruments of PharmAthene. Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials. Except where the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Altimmune” or the “Company” refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Mergers, to Private Altimmune and its subsidiaries, and for periods following the completion of the Mergers to the combined company and its subsidiaries.
Pemvidutide 
We completed an acquisition in July 2019 of all of the equity interests of Spitfire Pharma, Inc. (“Spitfire”). Spitfire was a privately held, preclinical pharmaceutical company with the primary asset being a novel peptide-based dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist for the treatment of NASH. We refer to this product candidate as pemvidutide, and it is designed to treat obesity and the metabolic dysfunction that causes NASH. 
Obesity is a significant burden to the global healthcare systems and is implicated in two-thirds of the leading causes of death from non-communicable diseases worldwide. Some of the leading co-morbidities of obesity include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and breathing problems, certain cancers and NASH. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, total obesity related medical care in the U.S. is estimated to be $147.0 billion per annum. Globally, the market size for weight loss alone was $8.36 billion in 2020 and is estimated that it will reach $27.1 billion by 2028. Previous approaches to the treatment of obesity have been associated with safety concerns, limiting the success of those approaches.
NASH involves multiple metabolic pathways leading to the abnormal accumulation of liver fat, toxic lipid metabolites, and inflammation, leading to fibrosis or eventually liver cancer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), the fatty liver precursor to NASH, is present in up to 90% of obese patients, and approximately 20% of NAFLD patients progress to NASH. In addition, up to 40% of NASH patients develop NAFLD recurrence one year after liver transplant, which we believe indicates that the underlying metabolic disease is still present after transplant. We believe the treatment of obesity is the cornerstone of treating NASH and the principal morbidities of NASH.
Pemvidutide’s dual agonist mechanism of action is designed to combine the activity of GLP-1 for the reduction of appetite and inflammation, with the direct activity of glucagon on the liver, including increased energy expenditure, adipose browning, lipolysis and mobilization of the liver fat. Pemvidutide incorporates a proprietary side chain, referred to as the EuPort domain, which is designed to enhance pharmacokinetics for tolerability in the gastrointestinal tract and permit weekly dosing. As observed in a well-established preclinical model of the disease, pemvidutide is capable of inducing significant weight loss with concomitant decreases in liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, pemvidutide demonstrated improved metabolic function and exhibited pleiotropic effects in our preclinical testing across multiple metabolic pathways involved in NASH. We also observed in these studies that pemvidutide resulted in profound suppression of genes associated with steatosis, inflammation and stellate cell fibrosis by RNA sequencing. 
Clinical Trial Results – Obesity

In September 2021, we announced the completion of a 12-week Phase 1 clinical trial of pemvidutide in Australia under a clinical trial application. The trial was a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose (“MAD”) study in overweight and obese volunteers. The endpoints of the Phase 1 trial were to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pemvidutide, with primary readouts on safety, pharmacokinetics and weight loss. Additional readouts included metabolic and lipid profile, cardiovascular measures and glucose homeostasis. At 12 weeks, subjects receiving pemvidutide showed mean weight losses of 4.9%, 10.3% and 9.0% at the 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses, respectively, while the placebo group experienced a mean weight loss of 1.6%, and in the absence of caloric restriction or lifestyle modification. Weight loss occurred rapidly and consistently over 12 weeks.

​
The 1.8 mg dose cohort experienced the highest weight loss, with 100% of the subjects losing at least 5% of body weight and 55% of subjects losing at least 10% of body weight. The amounts of weight loss at the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses were similar given the sample size and overlapping confidence intervals. No correlation was found between the magnitude of weight loss and either age or baseline body mass index (“BMI”). Favorable or statistically significant trends were observed in secondary measures, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum lipids and HOMA-IR (a measure of insulin resistance). In addition, a rise in ketone bodies was observed, consistent with the effects of glucagon on fat metabolism.
Side effects in this study were mild to moderate, with no serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events reported. No discontinuations due to adverse events were reported.

Unlike the majority of other clinical trials with agents within the GLP-1 class, including dual agonists and tri-agonists, a gradual increasing of dose within a subject over a period of weeks to months to improve tolerability was not used in the pemvidutide trial. Even without that so called dose titration, the symptoms experienced by subjects who received pemvidutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg were predominantly mild, did not require treatment and were consistent with known effects of GLP-1-based therapies. Tolerability was observed to decrease at the highest dose level. One subject receiving placebo and one subject receiving pemvidutide 1.8 mg had a 3 to 5-fold elevation in alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) levels over baseline that resolved rapidly after a pause in dosing. In this trial, no perturbations of glucose control, as assessed by fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c, were observed in subjects with obesity/overweight with pre-diabetes; in fact, a reduction of insulin resistance was observed, as expected when significant weight loss is experienced. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial to establish the effects of pemvidutide on glucose control and confirm the reduction in insulin resistance in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Clinical Trial Results – Liver Fat Content
While the trial inclusion criteria did not pre-specify a minimum liver fat content (“LFC”), the trial did enroll a number of subjects with measurable LFC as determined by magnetic resonance imaging – proton density fat fraction (“MRI-PDFF”). A post-hoc analysis of the trial data through 6 weeks showed that 8 subjects had hepatic steatosis, defined as liver fat content greater than or equal to 5% (LFC range from 5.5% to 19.5%), at baseline. LFC fell below the limit of detection (“LOD”), or less than 1.5%, within 6 weeks of treatment in all subjects with steatosis receiving the 1.8 mg or 2.4 mg dose of pemvidutide, representing a greater than 90% reduction in the liver fat content (see chart below). These findings reinforce the results from preclinical studies of pemvidutide, in which we observed statistically greater reductions in liver fat than an equivalent dose of semaglutide. We believe these findings support the potential combined beneficial effects of weight loss and glucagon agonism on liver fat content.

Clinical Development Plan
We submitted an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for evaluation of pemvidutide in obesity to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2021 and we announced on January 31, 2022 that we had received FDA clearance for a Phase 2 trial in this indication. We expect to initiate this 48-week Phase 2 obesity trial in the first half of 2022. The readouts of that study will include safety, weight loss and other metabolic measures. The study will include a 24-week interim analysis of safety and weight loss that we expect will read out in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We are currently conducting a 12-week Phase 1b trial of pemvidutide in patients with NAFLD at multiple sites in the United States. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will enroll approximately 72 diabetic and non-diabetic overweight and obese adult patients with a liver fat content greater than 10% as measured by MRI-PDFF. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in liver fat content from baseline, with a secondary endpoint of weight loss. The study is expected to read out topline results in the third quarter of 2022. We expect to initiate a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled extension study which, combined with the 12-week Phase 1b NAFLD trial, will allow patients to receive up to a total of 24 weeks of continuous pemvidutide or placebo treatment and provide a read out on weight loss after 24 weeks of treatment, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. Based on the findings of the NAFLD study and evaluation of other priorities, we intend to initiate a 52-week biopsy-driven Phase 2 NASH study in 2022.
HepTcell 
HepTcell is an immunotherapeutic product candidate for patients chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (“HBV”). Approximately 300 million people worldwide live with chronic HBV infection, including approximately 2.2 

8



million in the United States. Chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Approximately 780,000 people die per year worldwide due to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Current antivirals prevent disease progression but rarely clear chronic infection. HepTcell is designed to drive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against all HBV genotypes in patients of all ethnic backgrounds. Stimulating T-cell responses in chronically infected HBV patients has been challenging because chronic infection with HBV strongly suppresses T-cell immunity directed against the virus. HepTcell focuses the T cell response on discrete, highly conserved regions of the HBV proteome. We believe our approach allows HepTcell to break immune tolerance by activating T-cells against critical viral sequences with decreased probability of immune escape due to viral mutation. HepTcell is based on our synthetic peptide technology platform and is given by intramuscular injection. In 2018, we completed a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in adult patients with chronic HBV. The HepTcell Phase 1 trial was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation study that enrolled 61 subjects with chronic HBV who were HBeAg-negative and well-controlled on licensed antivirals. A total of 41 patients received one of two dose levels of HepTcell, with and without IC31™, a depot-forming TLR9 adjuvant developed by Valneva SE, while 20 control patients received either IC31 alone or placebo. Patients received three injections 28 days apart and were followed for six months after the final dose. All dose combinations were generally well-tolerated and met the primary endpoint of safety. In the two adjuvanted HepTcell arms, T-cell responses against HBV markedly increased over baseline compared to placebo.
The table below presents the immunogenicity against hepatitis B epitopes that was demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trial:

We initiated a Phase 2 study during Q4 2020 in the United States, Canada and Europe that is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 80 adult patients with HBeAg-negative inactive CHB and HBsAg ≤ 100 IU/mL. Patients with HBsAg ≤ 100/mL are more likely to mount effective T cell responses against HBV than those with higher levels. The vision is that HepTcell could be used in combination with newer direct acting agents that may be more effective than nucleosides in reducing HBsAg to this level. HepTcell is being administered in 6 doses at the low dose level of HepTcell plus IC31™ at 4-week intervals for 24 weeks, and patients will be followed for one year to evaluate safety and durability of response. The primary efficacy endpoint is virological response, defined as a 1-log reduction in HBsAg levels from baseline or HBsAg clearance at 24 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints include reactivation of anti-HBV T cell responses and other assessments of virologic response. We expect data from this study in the first half of 2023. A follow-up phase will assess the safety and durability of response one year after completion of treatment.
Discontinued Programs
AdCOVID 
AdCOVID was an intranasal COVID-19 vaccine candidate designed to guard the respiratory tract from viral invasion and to provide protection against viral spread through stimulation of both mucosal and systemic antibodies (IgA 

9



and IgG) as well as cell-mediated immunity. By stimulating mucosal immunity in the nasal cavity, a key point of entry and replication for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we believed that AdCOVID had the potential to defend against both the infection and spread of the virus to others. We submitted an IND to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2020 and received clearance from the FDA in February 2021 to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of AdCOVID. The Phase 1 clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of AdCOVID in 92 healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. In June 2021, we announced the discontinuation of the development program for AdCOVID following our review of findings from the Phase 1 clinical trial and in consideration of the highly competitive COVID-19 landscape. In the study, the tolerability of AdCOVID was similar to placebo, but the immunogenicity data demonstrated lower than expected immune responses for each of the immune parameters tested.
T-COVID
T-COVID was an intranasal immune modulating therapeutic candidate based on the same replication-deficient adenovirus 5 (“RD-Ad5”) vector technology behind our other intranasal vaccine candidates, but it acted through a different mechanism that may have involved the innate immune system. With the support of the U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command in collaboration with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, during 2020, we initiated a placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the potential of T-COVID to prevent clinical worsening in patients with early COVID-19. The trial was expected to enroll 96 community-based patients who were 18 years and older that present with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, with onset of symptoms within 48 hours, and a diagnosis of COVID-19 within 72 hours. The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients with clinical worsening, defined as a 4% decrease in pulse oxygen saturation, or the need for hospitalization. Secondary endpoints measured the average decrease in resting pulse oxygen saturation, average increase in resting pulse rate and proportion of patients requiring oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation. However, the effective rollout in the U.S. of authorized COVID-19 vaccines and decreasing incidence of disease significantly reduced the number of patients meeting our enrollment criteria, and we had been unable to enroll subjects in the final cohort, the cohort most likely to benefit from T-COVID. As a result of enrollment challenges, we decided to terminate further enrollment and have terminated the development of T-COVID.
NasoShield 
NasoShield was an anthrax vaccine product candidate designed to provide rapid and stable protection after a single intranasal administration. It was being developed with the support of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) for post-exposure prophylaxis against anthrax following exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores. We commenced a Phase 1b trial of NasoShield in adults in 2020 which builds on the Phase 1a trial completed in 2018 and evaluated the effect of modified methods of intranasal dosing on NasoShield safety and immunogenicity. The trial enrolled 42 healthy subjects who received intranasally administered NasoShield or saline placebo and were then monitored for 6 months post-dosing. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of NasoShield. The primary immunogenicity readouts included the serum binding antibody to protective antigen and anthrax toxin blocking antibody responses at 28- and 56-days post-dose administration. Stimulation of the mucosal IgA immune response in the nasal cavity was also assessed. In April 2021, we received clinical data from the Phase 1b trial that showed positive immunogenicity results and a NasoShield tolerability profile similar to placebo. On December 31, 2021, the development support from BARDA ended and we have discontinued further development of the program.
NasoVAX
NasoVAX was a recombinant intranasal vaccine product candidate that was being developed for both seasonal and pandemic use. We believed NasoVAX could simultaneously activate the humoral, mucosal and cellular immune arms which may enable a more comprehensive immune response. The data from our Phase 2a trial with a monovalent NasoVAX vaccine indicated that NasoVAX achieved 100% seroprotection based on serum antibody responses, which was comparable to published results of a licensed injected influenza vaccine. Statistically significant increases in mucosal antibody were noted as well as a robust T cell response directed against influenza. The tolerability profile of NasoVAX was similar to placebo. Approximately half of the subjects from the highest dose were evaluated between 12 and 14 months after initial dosing for additional immunogenicity assessment. The durability data show that the immune response elicited by NasoVAX was stable with no overall change in the antibody titer or level of seroprotection over an average of 

10



13 months. After evaluating the development path of NasoVAX, we have discontinued further development of the program.
Our Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include the following:

● | Apply our EuPort platform technologies to design and develop treatments for obesity, NASH and other metabolic diseases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strategically partner or out-license certain product candidates at later stages of development to focus our efforts on early to mid-stage product development; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-license or acquire complementary metabolic or immunotherapeutic technologies and product candidates that are either synergistic or complementary to our capabilities to expand our pipeline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Platforms
Certain product candidates are based on our proprietary platform technologies as described below:
Incretin-based Peptide Technology – EuPort
EuPort is a platform technology that comprises a hydrophobic domain (e.g., substituted or unsubstituted alkyl chain) and a hydrophilic group (e.g., saccharide) conjugated to a non-terminal amino acid of the peptide. The technology, on which pemvidutide is based, allows the peptide to bind extensively to albumin, an abundant protein in the blood, slowing the elimination of the peptide and increasing its serum half-life, allowing for weekly instead of daily dosing, for example. EuPort technology may also slow the entry of the peptide into the circulation following subcutaneous injection which may lead to improvements in tolerability or other characteristics of the peptide as have been observed with pemvidutide. We have license rights to develop incretin-based peptide therapeutics based on EuPort technology for any indication.
Key aspects of our EuPort technology, supported by findings in our preclinical studies, include its potential to:

● | increase the serum half-life of the peptide allowing for extended dosing intervals; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | slow the entry of the peptide into the circulation, increasing the Tmax of the peptide, and potentially improving the tolerability of the peptide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetic Peptide Technology - Densigen
Densigen is our synthetic fluorocarbon peptide technology platform. HepTcell, an immunotherapeutic developed using our Densigen platform, is designed to activate T-cells to generate a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. This synthetic peptide technology is based on peptides of 30 – 40 amino acids that comprise a high density of CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes selected to focus the T-cell response on highly conserved targets and allow diverse populations to respond to the product candidate. Densigen technology is protected by patents owned by us.
Key aspects of our Densigen technology, supported by findings in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, include its potential to:

● | elicit responses across multiple targets for the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | direct an immune response precisely to specific antigen sites, thereby avoiding more reactive but less effective sites present in the full-length protein; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prompt a stronger immune response than naked peptides due to depot effect caused by attaching a biologically inert fluorocarbon chain to each peptide.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11



Intranasal Vaccines – RespirVec
Our RespirVec platform is designed to elicit rapid and long-term immune protection by intranasal delivery of adenovectored pathogen sequences. We believe that our RespirVec technology may be particularly well-suited for respiratory pathogens as a result of its ability to stimulate mucosal immunity in the nasal cavity, a site of viral attack. RespirVec is designed to stimulate serum neutralizing antibody and cellular immune response for a broad immune response and is stable at room temperature for several months. We believe that the favorable stability profile of RespirVec vaccines, when combined with the simple intranasal route of administration, has the potential for efficient and inexpensive distribution of the vaccine.
RespirVec technology is comprised of intranasal delivery of replication-deficient adenoviruses and is protected by patents that we own or license.
Key aspects of our RespirVec technology, supported by findings in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, include its potential to:

● | enable intracellular expression of the vaccine antigen for authentic immune presentation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mobilize the innate, cellular and mucosal immune systems, not just the antibody-based response triggered by conventional injectable vaccines;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | elicit a more durable antibody response than typical licensed injectable vaccines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide a self-adjuvanting adenovector delivery system with the potential to improve immunogenicity; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | allow a rapid production cycle at anticipated lower costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological progress. In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is either more efficacious, particularly in the relevant target populations, offers a better safety or tolerability profile, is less expensive or quicker to manufacture, or represents a combination of these advantages. We also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sale.
Large and established companies such as Eli Lilly, Roche, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, among others, compete in the same market as our product candidates. These companies compete with us with their greater experience and resources to support their research and development efforts, conduct testing and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals to market products, manufacture such products on a broad scale and market approved products. These companies also compete with us by having significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the products that we develop obsolete. We also face competition from smaller companies who, like us, rely on investors to fund research and development and compete for co-development and licensing opportunities from large and established pharmaceutical companies.
We face competition for pemvidutide, our dual GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist for the treatment of obesity and NASH. For obesity, we face competition from companies such as Novo Nordisk, whose GLP-1 agonist, brand named Wegovy, or compound name semaglutide, was approved in June 2021. Other companies with potentially competitive candidates in development, include Eli Lilly with GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (“GIP”) 

12



dual agonists; Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck/Hamni Pharmaceutical, AstraZeneca, Innovent Biologics/Eli Lilly and D&D Pharma, with GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonists; Hanmi Pharmaceutical and Eli Lilly with GLP-1/glucagon/GIP triple agonists; and Novo Nordisk with Amylin and Amylin-GLP-1 combination candidates. We face competition in NASH from companies such as Intercept Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a farnesoid X receptor (“FXR”) agonist; Madrigal Pharmaceuticals and Viking Therapeutics, which are developing orally administered, thyroid hormone receptor (“THR”) β-selective agonist; Akero Therapeutics, 89Bio, Novo Nordisk and Roche, which are developing fibroblast growth factor 21 analogs; Novo Nordisk, which is developing a GLP-1 agonist; Eli Lilly which is developing a GLP-1/GIP dual receptor agonist; Merck, which is developing a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist; Hanmi Pharmaceutical, which is developing a GLP-1/glucagon receptor/GIP receptor triple agonist; and, Inventiva, which is developing a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) agonist. Finally, we face competition for HepTcell, our immunotherapeutic HBV product candidate, from companies such as Janssen, Vaccitech and VBI Vaccines, all of which are developing a therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV infection. In addition, many other companies are developing direct acting antivirals against HBV.
Intellectual Property
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States and abroad. The patent coverage available to biotechnology companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

● | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have relied upon certain proprietary trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop a competitive position. In efforts to maintain confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets, proprietary information and developments, all of our employees are required to execute agreements regarding confidentiality and assign to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us. We may in the future use license agreements to access external products and technologies as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
Patent Rights Related to our RespirVec Platform Technology
Immunotherapy for Respiratory Pathogens — Intranasal Application of Adenoviral Vector Vaccines
We have developed a rapid and prolonged immunologic-therapeutic technology, for which we have a patent issued or allowed in the United States, Europe, South Korea and Japan for respiratory pathogens including influenza, coronavirus and anthrax; and pending applications in the United States, Europe, Japan and other commercially relevant jurisdictions. The claims are directed to methods for inducing an immune response against respiratory pathogens including influenza, coronavirus and Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, comprising intranasal administration of an effective amount of E1 and/or E3 deleted adenovirus. The patent and, if issued, the patent(s) resulting from the pending applications have an expiration date no earlier than March 2032, not giving effect to any potential extensions and assuming payment of all associated fees.
We have also developed methods of administering and dosing the intranasal adenoviral vector vaccine compositions, for which we have an international (“PCT”) patent application filed, with expectation that in due course in jurisdictions of commercial consideration (e.g., United States, Europe, Japan) there will be national or regional patent applications based on the PCT. The claims are directed to transmucosal administration of our respiratory anti-infective product candidates based on our RespirVec platform technology. The patent(s), if issued, resulting from the pending 

13



application have an expiration date of no earlier than August 2040, not giving effect to any potential extensions and assuming payment of all associated fees.
PER.C6 Cell Line — In-Licensed from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Formerly Crucell Holland, B.V.)
We are the non-exclusive licensee of patent rights held by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Formerly Crucell Holland, B.V.) (“Janssen”), covering a method of producing an adenoviral vector stock using cell lines including the PER.C6 cell line, which may be used for the development and manufacture of vaccine products.
We entered into an amended license agreement with Janssen, effective as of October 4, 2005, which amended and restated our prior license agreements with Janssen. Under the amended license agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) under certain patent rights and know-how to use Janssen’s proprietary cell line to develop, manufacture and commercialize vaccines to prevent and/or treat influenza virus and anthrax infection in humans.
In consideration for the license, we paid an up-front license fee, issued equity shares, and agreed to pay certain development-based milestone payments through approval of licensed products by the FDA, up to an aggregate amount of approximately $2.5 million. We also agreed to pay royalty payments as a percentage of net sales of products in any country where the manufacture of such product is covered by a valid claim of any licensed patent or uses licensed know-how, subject to a royalty stacking reduction and minimum annual royalty payments, until the expiration of the term of the amended agreement.
We further amended our license agreement with Janssen, effective September 25, 2015, primarily to streamline our manufacturing license arrangements. Prior to the 2015 amendment, we entered into three-party manufacturing license agreements with each manufacturer and Janssen. The 2015 amendment enables us to directly grant sublicenses of certain of our rights under Janssen’s patent rights and know-how to manufacturers, subject to Janssen’s consent which may not be withheld if the manufacturer meets certain criteria.
We may terminate the amended license agreement without cause, and the agreement contains customary provisions for either party to terminate prior to the expiration of the agreement. The amended license agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of the date upon which the last of the licensed patents applicable to the relevant product expires or 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of the relevant product. The Janssen patent rights include patents issued in the United States with an expected expiration date no earlier than April 2020, in each case not giving effect to any potential extensions and assuming payment of all associated fees. Upon expiration of the amended license agreement, or if we terminate the amended license agreement for Janssen’s material breach, we retain the right to exploit the rights granted.
On April 2, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Restated License Agreement and additionally entered into Amendment No. 4, 5 and 6 throughout 2020 (collectively, the “Amendments”), by and between us and Janssen (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Second Restated License Agreement and Amendment No. 2 to Second Restated License Agreement, together with the Amendments, the “License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the field of licenses granted to us for the use of the PER.C6 cell line under the License Agreement is expanded to cover COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), in addition to the existing licenses related to Bacillus anthracis and influenza virus. Pursuant to the Amendment, we agreed to pay certain additional development-based milestone payments through approval of licensed products by the FDA for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, up to an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. We also agreed to pay royalty payments as a percentage of net sales of products to a royalty stacking reduction and minimum annual royalty payments, until the expiration of the term of the License Agreement, as amended. We additionally entered into Amendment No. 4, 5 and 6 throughout 2020 to add additional manufacturing partners related to manufacturing AdCOVID. As of December 31, 2021, we have paid Janssen $2.9 million in cash and equity under the License Agreement.

Government Contracts
Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from grants and United States government contracts. There can be no assurances that our remaining U.S. government contract will be continued, renewed beyond the base period, or that we can enter into new contracts or receive new grants to supply the U.S. or other governments with our products. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain.
U.S. government contracts typically are subject to audit by the government and contain termination provisions for the government allowing it to terminate at its discretion, which subjects us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government unilaterally to:

● | preclude us, either temporarily or for a set period of time, from receiving new contracts or extending our remaining contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




● | terminate our remaining contracts either for the convenience of the government (at the government’s sole discretion, for example, if funds become unavailable or the government no longer wants the work) or for default (for failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | revise the scope and value of our contracts and/or the timing for work to be performed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | control and potentially prohibit the export of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | claim rights to intellectual property, including our products, developed under the contract;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | add or remove the terms and conditions in our contracts; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | cancel or amend planned procurements, including outstanding request for proposal solicitations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
MTEC COVID-19 Contract
We funded our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of T-COVID with a $4.7 million grant from the U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command (“USAMRDC”). The competitive award was granted by USAMRDC in collaboration with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (“MTEC”), a 501(c)(3) biomedical technology consortium working in partnership with the Department of Defense (“DoD”). Under the contract, MTEC paid us a firm fixed fee based on achieving certain milestones for conduct and completion of a Phase 1/2 study. Through December 31, 2021, we have collected an aggregate of approximately $4.7 million in cash under the contract.
We own the intellectual property rights to inventions made by us in the performance of work under the MTEC contracts provided that we disclose such inventions to the U.S. government and notify the U.S. government of our election to retain title. The U.S. government will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on our behalf, such inventions throughout the world, in addition to other rights customarily reserved by the U.S. government for intellectual property generated using government funds.
BARDA Anthrax Contract
We were developing our NasoShield anthrax vaccine pursuant to a contract with BARDA that commenced in July 2016. Under this contract, BARDA paid us a fixed fee and reimburses certain of our costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) manufacture and conduct of a Phase 1 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consisted of an initial base performance period providing approximately $30.9 million in funding for the period July 2016 through December 2021. BARDA had seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical studies for a three-year period. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would have provided additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million, providing a total contract potential of $136.8 million. Through December 31, 2021, the end of the contract, we have collected an aggregate of approximately $29.2 million in cash under the current BARDA contract.
We have been audited by BARDA through 2019 and have agreed on final indirect rates with BARDA through 2019.
We own the intellectual property rights to inventions made by us in the performance of work under the BARDA contracts, provided that we disclose such inventions to the U.S. government and notifies the U.S. government of our election to retain title. The U.S. government will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to 

17



practice, or have practiced for or on our behalf, such inventions throughout the world, in addition to other rights customarily reserved by the U.S. government for intellectual property generated using government funds.
BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. Our contracts with BARDA, like those awarded by other U.S. government agencies, contain provisions not typically found in commercial contracts. Most notably, BARDA, or the U.S. government acting through BARDA, may terminate, modify or amend our contract, in whole or in part, for nearly any reason or no reason.
United States Government Regulation
The FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”), the FDA regulations under Titles 21 and 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR and 42 CFR), as well as other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, research, manufacturing, approval, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, sale, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs and biological products. An IND application must be in effect before clinical testing of drugs and biological products can begin. FDA approval must be obtained before drugs and biological products can be marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and each process may take several years to complete, although certain expedited programs potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as FDA fast track designation for certain new drugs with the potential to address unmet medical needs for certain serious or life-threatening conditions, may potentially expedite development and/or approval processes. Certain federal incentive programs are also potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as for “orphan drugs” that treat rare conditions. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. In addition, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
Drug and Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to applicable good laboratory practices (“GLP”), applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals, such as the Animal Welfare Act or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before a clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCP”) and any additional requirements for the protection
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of clinical trials, as well as the results of preclinical testing, detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product candidate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to confirm that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to assure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of potential FDA audits of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP and the Animal Welfare Act.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. The FDA may also place the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Even after the IND has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may also impose a partial or complete clinical hold on clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. A partial clinical hold would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. A complete clinical hold order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed or resume. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once the trials have begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events (“AEs”) should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND during applicable phases of development. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations and GCP requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, with the goals of assuring that the data and results are credible and accurate and that study participants’ rights, safety, and well-being are protected. GCP requirements include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials, not only from the investigational product itself but also from any required procedures or study visits to be conducted during the trial, are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

19



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The drug or biological product is initially introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects (e.g., 10 to 20 volunteers) and tested for safety and to develop detailed profiles of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic actions, determine side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The drug or biological product is evaluated in a larger but limited patient population (e.g., a few hundred patients with the disease or conduction under study) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. These clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population (e.g., several hundred to several thousand patients) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing and other sources that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
In limited circumstances, FDA also permits the administration of investigational small molecule drug or biological products to patients under its expanded access regulatory authorities. Under the FDA’s expanded access authority, patients who are not able to participate in a clinical trial may be eligible for accessing investigational products, including through individual compassionate or emergency use in concert with their requesting physician. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Certain FDA programs are available to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs intended to address unmet needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. These expedited programs include fast 

20



track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Each of these programs has its own features and qualifying criteria. A sponsor must submit a request for fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or priority review, which may or may not be granted by the FDA. For fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, FDA may later decide the product no longer meets the conditions for designation and may rescind the designation. For accelerated approval, a sponsor generally discusses the possibility of accelerated approval with the FDA during development, and the FDA may or may not agree that accelerated approval is an appropriate pathway for a particular drug. Some of these expedited programs could potentially apply to our product candidates, although this cannot be assured, and we do not currently have any products with expedited program designations.
The sponsor of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, a manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a drug or biological product candidate, the FDA’s approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product may begin. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA generally must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers depending on the designated pathway for submission. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. FDA performance goals generally provide for action on an NDA or BLA within 10 months of the 60-day filing date, which would be within 12 months of its submission. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to 6 months of the 60-day filing date, or 8 months after submission, for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure the product’s identity, safety, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for drugs or biological products that are novel or that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
During the NDA or BLA review process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is 

21



needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant may take for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the complete response letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Post-approval modifications to a drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require development and submission of additional information or data in a new or supplemental NDA or BLA, which would also require prior FDA approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, products are subject to extensive continuing regulation and post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to keep extensive records, submit annual reports, report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the NDA or BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products also must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA or BLA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required.
Future FDA inspections may identify cGMP compliance issues at manufacturer facilities or at the facilities of third-party suppliers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct and prevent 

22



recurrence of any deficiencies, and could result in fines or penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, license revocations, seizure, total or partial suspension of production or criminal penalties, any of which could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications.
Certain U.S. Regulatory Incentives and Other Programs
Marketing Exclusivity and Patent Term Restoration 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, established certain periods of marketing exclusivity for new drugs approved by the FDA, including a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another applicant for such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Amendment also established a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application (e.g., new indications, dosages or strengths of an approved drug). This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active ingredient for other conditions of use.
For biological products, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”), created an abbreviated regulatory approval pathway in the United States for biological products that are found to be “biosimilar” to (and in some instances “interchangeable” with) a biological “reference product” previously licensed under an NDA or BLA. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by the reference product’s sponsor and the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference product. Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference product’s NDA or BLA. In general, no biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until 4 years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed by the FDA.
While we would expect to be granted this 12-year period of exclusivity for our applicable product candidates, if approved, this period of reference product market exclusivity applies only to the biosimilar pathway and will not, for example, provide protection against any biological product for a similar indication that achieves FDA approval under a traditional NDA or BLA based on the sponsor’s own research data. There is also risk that the 12-year period of biological reference product exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates, if they are approved, to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Once approved, biosimilars likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be interchangeable with, the previously approved reference product. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, would be substituted for any one of our product candidates, if approved, in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Given this uncertainty, there is risk that, if approved, a biosimilar competitor to one of our products could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our product, if approved by the FDA.

23



Additionally, products approved under an NDA or BLA may qualify for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of the application, if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA or BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA or BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Drugs and biological products, such as our product candidates, may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, an incentive intended to encourage medical product research for children. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, may add six months to certain patents or regulatory exclusivity periods applicable to an approved drug and six months to regulatory exclusivity periods applicable to an approved biological product. This additional six months of exclusivity may be granted based on the completion of one or more pediatric trials in response to a Written Request from the FDA. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to pediatric populations. 
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such a disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user fee exemptions. In addition, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA would not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may target rare diseases or conditions.
U.S. Regulations Affecting Health Care Companies
Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products that are reimbursed by U.S. federally funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are subject to so-called fraud and abuse laws including false claims and anti-kickback laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willingly, directly or indirectly, soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration with the intent of (or in return for) generating referrals of individuals or purchases, leases, orders, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable by federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have interpreted this law very broadly, including by holding that a violation has occurred if one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals even if there are other lawful purposes. Moreover, liability under the Anti-Kickback Law may be established without proving actual knowledge of the law or specific intent to violate. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements from prosecution or administrative sanctions, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. The fact that an arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct illegal under the Anti-Kickback Law, but the arrangement may be subject to scrutiny based on the facts and circumstances. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or exclusion from participation in 

24



federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have enacted similar laws, some of which apply regardless of payer.
The Federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. The FCA is commonly enforced against those who submit allegedly false Medicare or Medicaid claims, as well as those who induce or assist others to submit a false claim. “False claims” can result not only from non-compliance with the express requirements of applicable governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicaid or Medicare, but also from non-compliance with other laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Law or laws that require quality care in service delivery. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the government or by whistleblowers referred to as “relators,” who may initiate an action in the name of the government and the individual and may share in any monetary recovery. Violations of the FCA can result in treble damages, mandatory per claim penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, some of which are broader than the FCA, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to FCA penalties.
The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the FCA and federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things, made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal FCA liability. The bringing of any FCA or other enforcement investigation or action, even if unsuccessful, could require us to devote resources to investigate and defend the action, as well as result in reputational harm. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, many of these laws are vague, subject to modification, and are subject to evolving interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. We cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition to the above, several other laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. Some state laws restrict whether and when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to health care professionals or engage in other marketing-related activities; some states require certain compliance program elements and disclosures; and certain states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives.
For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Law, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating the HIPAA fraud statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Violations of HIPAA fraud provisions may result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties, fines and damages, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Privacy Laws
In the U.S., we may be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-

25



related and other personal information. Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys, including class action attorneys, have been and will likely continue to be active in this space.
HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
In addition, the CCPA establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency, and provides California residents certain rights concerning the use, disclosure and retention of their personal data. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended multiple times since their enactment. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”). The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and damages. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. The CCPA and evolving legislation may require us, among other things, to update our notices and develop new processes internally and with our partners.
If we, our agents, or our third-party partners fail to comply or are alleged to have failed to comply with these or other applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, or if we were to experience a data breach involving personal information, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or private lawsuits. Any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or other government actions could lead to unfavorable outcomes that have a material impact on our business including through significant penalties or fines, monetary judgments or settlements including criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, or other remedies that harm our business, including orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
Outside the U.S., the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues that could potentially affect our business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes fines of up to EUR 20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America increases potential enforcement and litigation activity.
U.S. Health Care Reform Law
Our financial prospects could be affected by changes in health care spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, or decisions, related to, among other things, health care availability, or the method of delivery of or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.
For example, in the United States there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and commercial payers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, by increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, 

26



extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and imposing certain annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.
The Health Care Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund comparative effectiveness research. While the stated intent of comparative effectiveness research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of comparative effectiveness research could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be approved for sale, but then determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results.
Certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the Health Care Reform Law remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential changes or challenges are uncertain at this time. It is unclear how the Health Care Reform Law, its implementation, efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the Health Care Reform Law, or portions thereof, and other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future will affect our business. Another provision of the Health Care Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made (starting in 2021) to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website. Our compliance with these rules may also impose additional costs and may impact our relationships with physicians, teaching hospitals and the other non-physician health care providers.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed a law that provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. As another example, for calendar quarters beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers will be required to report the average sales price for certain drugs under the Medicare program regardless of whether we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Previously, such reporting was only required for manufacturers that participated in that program. Starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologicals, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages, for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of 10% of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug. Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125% of the refund amount.
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates.

27



Further, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
It is possible that the Health Care Reform Law, as currently enacted or may be amended or otherwise modified in the future, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare payment and other health care financing, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. For example, Congress could enact Medicare Part B and Part D inflation rebates, under which manufacturers would owe additional rebates if the average sales price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. These continuing health care reform initiatives may adversely affect:

● | the demand for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the level of taxes that we are required to pay.
--+------------------------------------------------

Congress also could enact additional changes that affect our overall rebate liability and the information we report to the government as part of price reporting calculations. In addition, Congress could enact a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend single source drugs would be capped by reference to the non-federal average manufacturer price. This or any other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our products. We further expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting and pricing more generally from Congress, agencies, and other bodies.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments such as gene therapy products. Sales of these or other product candidates that we may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.

28



There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines may be made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent certain new medicines will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Environmental Regulations
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
Pricing Regulations
There have been a number of federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the health care system of the United States. Concerns about drug pricing continue to be expressed by members of Congress and prior presidential administrations. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such health care changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
Non-U.S. Government Regulations
European Drug Development
Our products will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in the European Union (“EU”). As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. See “European Marketing Authorization” below.
As in the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. The EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) (Clinical Trials Directive) provides the clinical trials regulatory framework in the European Union, but the European Union member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the regimes of the different member states. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by the relevant National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”), and a Clinical Trial Authorization must be obtained. As of January 31, 2022, the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 will apply. The Clinical Trials Regulation will repeal and replace the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that will be conducted in multiple EU Member States, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results.
Similar to the FDA, Europe’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (“CHMP”) has adopted ICH S6 as a guideline governing preclinical testing of biologics. Sponsors usually must conduct pharmacodynamic (“PD”) studies, such as in vitro binding assays and in vivo studies that assess the product’s pharmacologic activity and define its mechanism of action. Biologics typically undergo single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies using relevant species. Safety pharmacology studies, which evaluate the product’s functional effects on major body systems and specific organs, and local tolerance testing can be done separately or subsumed in toxicity testing. Sponsors also usually conduct single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and/or toxicokinetic studies to assess absorption, disposition, exposure and clearance (in 

29



particular, antibody-mediated clearance), and explore dose-response relationships. This information is used to predict margins of safety for human studies. Immunogenicity testing might include screening and mechanistic studies.
Clinical Trial Authorization in the European Union
The Clinical Trials Directive and European Commission guidance describe the steps that a sponsor must take before commencing a clinical trial in the European Union. According to these documents, a clinical trial may commence only if: (i) the anticipated therapeutic and public health benefits outweigh any foreseeable risks and inconveniences to the subjects; (ii) the trial subjects understand the objectives and risks of the trial and give informed, written consent to participate; (iii) the trial safeguards the physical and mental integrity of the subjects; and (iv) insurance covers the liability of the sponsor and investigator. To comply with these requirements, the trial sponsor must take certain steps. In general, the sponsor must take responsibility for trial conduct, appointment of an appropriate investigator, selection of the institution that will conduct the trial, quality control, data collection standards, protocol drafting, and creation of the investigator’s brochure. The sponsor then must apply for approval from both the ethics committee and the relevant NCA in the member state. Written authorization may be required for all biologics trials and is required for trials involving medicines containing genetically modified organisms, medicines for gene therapy, and medicines for somatic cell therapy (including xenogeneic cell therapy). The opinion of the ethics committee should be issued within 60 days. A review period of 30 days can be added for medicines requiring written authorization noted earlier, and for xenogeneic cell therapy, there are no time limits for authorization. This timeframe can be extended by an additional 90 days (in addition to the original 90 days) if the ethics committee consults a national group or committee. The trial may begin only if (i) the ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion and (ii) no competent authority has informed the applicant of grounds for non-acceptance. Under the Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, applicable to new clinical trials as of January 31, 2022, authorization of clinical trials will take place through an EU portal resulting in approval for the various relevant EU Member States. Different timelines than those described above under the Clinical Trials Directive will apply to the new assessment procedure under the Clinical Trials Regulation. Under the Clinical Trials Regulation, ethics committee approval will continue to be required in accordance with the laws of the relevant EU Member States.
Good Clinical Practices and Other Considerations for Clinical Trials
Clinical trials of biologics must comply with GCP, as described in Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the ICH E6 guideline, which the CHMP has adopted. The directive and guideline describe general governing principles for clinical trials. The rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects must prevail over the interests of science and society. Investigators must obtain freely given informed consent from every trial subject before each subject is enrolled. Clinical trial information must be handled, recorded and stored with respect for relevant confidentiality and privacy rules. Trials must comply with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Specific GCP guidelines apply to trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. These guidelines regulate issues such as the donation, procurement and testing of human tissues and cells; the implementation of a traceability system; and specific rules on safety reporting and long-term follow-up. Under the Clinical Trials Directive and under the Clinical Trials Regulation, special requirements apply to clinical trials conducted on minors and other persons not able to give informed legal consent. These requirements are intended to preserve the dignity of the trial subjects, confirm that the benefits of the trial outweigh the risks and ensure that subjects’ representatives give consent with as much involvement of the subject as possible. Competent authorities must record information regarding trials in the European database of clinical trials which is accessible only to other competent authorities, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and the European Commission. CHMP has issued a guideline on quality requirements during the clinical trial period for investigational medicinal products containing biological or biotechnology-derived substances. The guideline describes quality documentation that should be submitted to the competent authority as part of the sponsor’s investigational medicinal product dossier (“IMPD”). The IMPD should include, among other things, (i) an adequate description of the process and process controls, including a flow chart of all successive steps and details of in-process testing and (ii) a description and justification of “any reprocessing during manufacture of the drug substance.” The guideline also recognizes that sponsors will improve and optimize their manufacturing processes during clinical development and describes the steps sponsors should take following these changes. Specifically, the sponsor must compare the quality attributes of the pre- and post-change biological active substances and relevant intermediates and conduct a comparability exercise where necessary. For first-in-human clinical trials, sponsors should use product representative of the material used during the non-clinical testing phase. Finally, with regard to characterization, the guideline requires details on the biological activity to be provided, recognizing that the extent of characterization data will further increase in later phases.

Study Design Considerations
General regulatory guidance on study design applies to biologics as well as small molecule medicines. According to the guidance, there is a “close, but variable correlation” between phase of development and type of study, but one type of trial can occur in several different phases. The guidance therefore identifies the most typical kind of study for each phase.
Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into human subjects, and studies in this phase usually have non-therapeutic objectives. Specifically, Phase 1 studies typically investigate initial safety and tolerability, PK, PD and/or drug activity, to preliminarily determine the potential therapeutic benefit of a medicine. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in healthy volunteers or certain types of patients. If the medicine has significant potential toxicity (e.g., cytotoxic products), the trial will usually be conducted in patients.
The most typical Phase 2 study is a therapeutic exploratory study that explores efficacy in narrowly defined, relatively homogenous groups of patients. Initially, studies may use a variety of designs (e.g., concurrent controls and comparisons with baseline status). Subsequent Phase 2 trials usually are randomized and concurrently controlled, allowing for evaluation of the medicine’s safety and efficacy for a particular indication. A major goal of this phase is to determine the dose(s) for Phase 3 trials.
Phase 3 typically involves therapeutic confirmatory studies that are designed to verify the preliminary evidence obtained in Phase 2 and to provide a sufficient basis for marketing authorization. Phase 3 studies may also further explore the dose response relationship, or explore the drug’s use in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or in combination with another drug. With regard to medicines administered for long periods, extended exposure trials ordinarily occur during Phase 3, although the sponsor may start them in Phase 2.
To ensure that clinical trials in all three phases of development will be adequate to support a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), sponsors should design these trials with the MAA requirements in mind. Biologics in general need to comply with the requirements set out in Part III of the Annex I to Directive 2003/63/EC (which amends the core EU medicines legislation, Directive 2001/83/EC), and advanced therapy medicinal products need to comply with the requirements described in Part IV.
Consultation with the European Medicines Agency
A sponsor may obtain, from the EMA, scientific advice regarding clinical trial protocols. Although this advice does not bind the ethics committees or NCAs and is not binding for purposes of a future MAA, it can be useful to guide revisions to the protocol. EMA’s remarks will only address scientific issues and will generally focus on matters such as the selection of endpoints and comparator, the duration of treatment or follow-up and the design of pivotal studies. Advice also might address a sponsor’s proposal to deviate from a CHMP guideline. If the applicant decides not to follow the EMA’s advice, it should justify this decision in its MAA. EMA guidance details the procedures for requesting scientific advice. The fact that an applicant requests advice from EMA does not preclude it from also seeking advice from national competent authorities or from foreign regulators, such as the FDA. The process of obtaining advice from the national competent authorities is often less formal than requesting advice from the EMA, and such advice can prove helpful. Consequently, seeking such advice is a common choice among applicants. Generally, the parallel scientific procedure is available for “important breakthrough drugs,” that is, products that the EMA and FDA have identified as falling within therapeutic areas of overlapping interest (e.g., oncology products, vaccines and blood products). The goal of these meetings is to provide clarity regarding the regulatory requirements of each region and the reasons for any differences between them. A sponsor requesting parallel scientific advice should authorize the agencies to exchange all information about the product, including trade secrets. After the parallel scientific advice procedure, each agency will provide its own independent advice on the questions at issue. There is no guarantee of harmonized advice or identical regulatory decisions on the approvability of the product.
European Marketing Authorization
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which includes the 27-member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after approval of a Marketing 

31



Authorization Application, or MAA. The MAA is based on the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted on the medicinal product in question. There are two types of MAAs:

● | The Centralized MAA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing new active substances indicated for certain diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for other drugs provided eligibility criteria are met. In all cases, to find out whether a product can be evaluated via the Centralized Procedure, applicants must always submit an eligibility request.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MAA can be recognized in other member states through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MAA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved by multiple member states in parallel through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
The Marketing Authorization Application: Contents and Approval Standard
Many biologics fall under the scope of the Centralized Procedure, which, as mentioned above, is mandatory for medicines developed through biotechnological methods, such as recombinant DNA technology; controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including transformed mammalian cells; and hybridoma and mAb methods. For example, cell therapy, gene therapy, vaccines from strains developed through recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion), and “any medicinal product for which a monoclonal antibody is used at any stage in the manufacturing process” are all subject to the Centralized Procedure. Nonetheless, some biologics are still approved at the member state level. For example, many vaccines do not fall within the scope of the Centralized Procedure. The EMA has published a guideline intended to harmonize the summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets for human vaccines.
With respect to the Centralized Procedure, the approval standards for biotechnology products are the same as for chemically synthesized medicines. Both types of products must be safe and effective and have appropriate quality. Because of their special characteristics, however, biotechnology products must comply with several additional dossier requirements. The MAA for a biotechnology product must meet the standard dossier submission requirements, as described in Article 8 of the Medicines Directive (2001/83/EC). Consequently, the MAA must generally comply with the Common Technical Document format, including with respect to Module I (administrative information, including labeling and mock-ups), Module 2 (various summaries), Module 3 (chemical, pharmaceutical and biological information), Module 4 (non-clinical reports) and Module 5 (clinical study reports). MAAs for biologics also must meet special requirements. The applicant must thoroughly describe the manufacturing process and must: (i) provide information on the origin and history of the starting materials; (ii) demonstrate that the active substance complies with specific measures for preventing the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies; (iii) if cell banks are used, demonstrate that cell characteristics remain unchanged at the passage level for production (and beyond); (iv) provide information as to whether there are adventitious agents in seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum or plasma, and all other materials of biological origin, and, if it is not possible to avoid the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents, show that further processing ensures elimination or inactivation of the agents; (v) if possible, base vaccine production on a seed lot system and established cell banks; (vi) in case of medicines derived from human blood or plasma, describe the origin, criteria and procedures for the collection, transportation and storage of the starting material; and (vii) describe the manufacturing facilities and equipment. Other special rules apply certain types of biological medicines. For example, for plasma-derived medicinal products, the applicant must provide an information dossier, the Plasma Master File. MAAs for vaccines other than for influenza need to contain a Vaccine Antigen Master File. Special rules also apply to advanced therapy medicinal products, including gene therapies, somatic cell therapies and tissue-engineered products.

Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, new medicinal products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application for eight years, after which generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period may be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the period of data exclusivity, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Designation in the European Union
The European Commission is also able to grant orphan designation in respect of medicinal products. To qualify the medicinal product must be intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union or (ii) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union where without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. Further, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question must exist in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan medicinal products still remain subject to the same regulatory approval process, albeit that they are always assessed through the Centralized Procedure. Effective September 19, 2018, sponsors applying for Orphan Designation must use EMA’s secure online IRIS platform. However, sponsors of orphan medicinal products are eligible to benefit from a number of incentives offered, including certain assistance with development of the medicinal product, reduced fees for MAA applications and protection from market competition once the medicinal product is authorized, as below.
Where an MAA in respect of an orphan medicinal product is granted, the European Commission, EMA and the competent authorities of the member states shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another application for an MAA, or grant an MAA or accept an application to extend an existing MAA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product, unless: (i) the holder of the MAA for the original orphan medicinal product has given its consent to the second applicant; (ii) the holder of the MAA for the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product; or (iii) the second applicant can establish the second medicinal is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
Other government regulation in the European Union
The European Union and the European Union member states have extensive laws and regulations relating to a variety of other topics that would be of relevance for us if we are active in the European Union, including but not limited to laws and regulations regarding data privacy, drug pricing and reimbursement, advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals.
Other Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product. As the United Kingdom is no longer a member state of the European Union, this may also apply to the United Kingdom. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and the approval of the regulators of foreign countries before we may market products in such countries. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

33



Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trials in the United States and Europe
The FDA has issued regulations governing its acceptance of foreign clinical data not conducted under an IND to support IND applications or marketing authorizations, such as BLAs. FDA may accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or marketing application if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Where a marketing application is based solely on foreign data, additional requirements apply, including a demonstration that the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice.
EU Directive 2001/83/EC allows for clinical trials conducted outside the European Union to be taken into consideration during the review of an MAA in the European Union if such trials have been designed, implemented and reported based on principles equivalent to those of the Clinical Trials Directive with regard to good clinical practice and ethical principles. Moreover, they should comply with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The applicant must submit a statement declaring such compliance as part of the MAA. In December 2008 and April 2012, the EMA published a strategy paper on the acceptance of data from foreign clinical trials conducted in “third countries,” particularly those outside the “‘traditional’ Western European and North American research areas.” According to the 2008 strategy paper, there is a “growing concern both among regulators and in public debate about how well these trials are conducted from an ethical and scientific/organizational standpoint.” The EMA has called for increased cooperation between international regulatory authorities involved in the supervision of clinical trials and has put forth other proposals to address these issues.
Manufacturing and Source of Supply
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. To date, we have obtained materials for clinical trials and non-clinical studies from third-party manufacturers who are suppliers to us. For our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional contract manufacturers to provide commercial scale manufacturing prior to submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA.
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 47 full-time employees, 13 of whom hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 18 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 29 are engaged primarily in research and development activities and 18 are engaged primarily in executive, finance and accounting, and administrative functions. As of December 31, 2021, 45 employees are located in the United States and two employees in the United Kingdom. Of our employees, 53% are female and 47% are male. None are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate Culture
Our values – compliance, collaboration, integrity and high performance – are built on the foundation that the employees we hire and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and productivity, which spur our success. This culture depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talents and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. Providing market competitive pay and benefit programs, opportunities to participate in the success they help create, while engaging employees in important dialogue regarding organization performance, we create a culture of inclusion in which all colleagues have the opportunity to thrive. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. 
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for all our employees, as well as participation in our equity programs.

Hybrid Culture and COVID-19
Like other companies, we have learned to adapt during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have prioritized employee safety and transparency during the pandemic and continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines issued by the CDC, the WHO and state and local authorities, where possible. In the second quarter of 2020, we made the decision to move to a hybrid workplace model, which means that certain of our employees will have the option to be 100% remote, work full-time in our office, or have the flexibility to work between office and remotely until the pandemic is resolved. This move provides our employees with continued flexibility, through the resolution of the pandemic, to work in person, remotely, or in a hybrid model. This will enable us to grow better as we develop our programs.
