Item 1. Business
Background
 
The Company is a development stage company and has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Summary
 
AllyMe Holding Inc. (formerly Rain Sound Acquisition Corporation) (the “Company” or “AllyMe”) is a blank check company and qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April 2012. The definition of an “emerging growth company” is a company with an initial public offering of common equity securities which occurred after December 8, 2011 and has less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during last completed fiscal year.
 
The Company was incorporated on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders and filing this registration statement. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company as part of the process toward the public trading of its stock.
 
In November 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming 19,500,000 shares of the then total 20,000,000 outstanding shares of existing shareholders, issuing 6,000,000 shares to a new shareholder, at par value per share, and at a discount of $600 representing 92.3% of the then total outstanding 6,500,000 shares of common stock, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Rain Sound Acquisition Corporation to AllyMe Holding Inc.


The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.
 
Management of the Company will pay all expenses incurred by the Company. Management does not expect any repayment for such paid expenses.
 
There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
