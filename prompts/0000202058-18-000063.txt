Description of Business by Segment
Communication Systems
Communication Systems serves markets in tactical communications and defense products, including tactical ground and airborne radio communications solutions and night vision technology, and in public safety networks.
Tactical Communications:    We are a leading global supplier of secure radio communications, tactical communication networks and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for a diverse portfolio of U.S. military and allied international forces and commercial customers. We design, develop and manufacture a comprehensive line of current and next-generation secure and protected radio communications products and systems, with capabilities to operate across numerous radio frequency bands and using an extensive range of waveforms. Our radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission requirements. Our tactical radios are built on software-defined radio platforms that include “headroom” to add future capabilities through software upgrades and that also have the highest grade embedded encryption. Product capabilities include secure transmission of voice, high-speed data and full-motion video, including streaming video to the tactical edge of 
 2

the battlefield. Supporting virtually all military domains, our products include handheld, manpack and vehicular, fixed-site and airborne form factors. Together, our products create a highly mobile, secure, reliable networked battlefield environment that connects land, air and sea echelons and does not rely on a fixed infrastructure. This networking capability allows warfighters, for example, to remain connected to each other and their command structures and support organizations and to communicate information and maintain situational awareness of both friendly and opposing forces, which are critical to mission safety and success. Our radio systems have been widely deployed throughout all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and have been sold to more than 100 countries through our international distribution channels, consisting of regional sales offices and a broad dealer network, becoming the standard in many of those countries. 
Our next-generation radios include multiband, multi-channel, multi-mission, legacy-system compatible tactical radios that address the full range of current mission and interoperability requirements and are fully upgradeable to address future technical standards and mission requirements. Advances in these radios include the support of wideband networking waveforms, extended frequency range and significant reductions in size, weight and power compared with previous generations. Wideband networking capability enables enhanced situational awareness through high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and connectivity to secure networks. Our comprehensive line of current and next-generation radios includes the following:

• | Our widely deployed Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (“SINCGARS”) family of backpack, vehicle-mounted, handheld and airborne radios currently used by U.S. and allied military forces — these Combat Net Radios, over 600,000 of which have been purchased and deployed worldwide, operate in the very high frequency (“VHF”) band, have single-frequency and frequency-hopping modes, handle voice and data communications and are designed to be reliable, secure and easily maintained.


• | Our multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G, which is National Security Agency (“NSA”) Type-1-certified for narrowband communications, as well as for wideband communications using our Harris-developed Adaptive Networking Wideband waveform and the U.S. military Joint Tactical Radio System (“JTRS”) Soldier Radio Waveform and Mobile User Objective System (“MUOS”) waveform, which provides connectivity to DoD’s next-generation MUOS satellite system;

We operate in this market principally on a “commercial” market-driven business model. We leverage our deep customer relationships to anticipate market needs and then invest our internal research and development resources, build to our internal forecast and provide ready-to-ship, commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) products to customers. This enables us to adapt to changing customer requirements, innovate and drive differentiation and bring products to market faster. We believe that the need to connect disparate networks using Internet Protocol (“IP”)-based technology is driving a modernization cycle in the U.S. and internationally. We believe our business model, which drives speed and innovation, coupled with the scale provided by our international presence, will continue to make us competitive in the global market.
We have been investing to position ourselves for tactical radio modernization opportunities, including in our next-generation manpack and handheld solutions for the JTRS Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (“HMS”) program and U.S. Special Operations Command (“SOCOM”) Special Operations Forces Tactical Communications (“STC”) programs, and for opportunities in manned and unmanned airborne applications from demand for extending ground tactical networks to the air.

We currently are deploying advanced technologies under the GPS III program to improve the accuracy and reliability of the next generation of GPS satellites. 
We also develop small, affordable, high-resolution commercial imaging systems. We design, develop, manufacture and integrate agile and high-performance modular, reconfigurable space payloads that maximize mission performance. We help our customers achieve their space missions more quickly and cost effectively by brokering, designing and integrating multimission satellite hosted payloads. For example, we supplied Aireon, LLC with ADS-B receiver payloads that are part of a satellite-based aircraft tracking system to enhance global ATC. The payloads are hosted on the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation and provide a capability separate from the main mission of the constellation. Using our experience with hosted payloads, we are expanding into agile and resilient small satellite solutions, which we believe are aligned with the U.S. Government’s disaggregation and affordability initiatives.
We also provide space antenna systems and precision space structures. We are an experienced space reflector manufacturer and specialize in large, high-accuracy reflectors. From unfurlable and fixed-mesh reflector antennas to solid spot beam antennas, our solutions deliver significantly higher data rates and access greater amounts of bandwidth than standard satellite antenna technologies.
Another example of our solutions for commercial customers is our tool suite to enable customers to extract information from geospatial imagery products, including our Jagwire™ web-based geospatial data management software that quickly discovers data, transforms it into information and delivers it to decision makers, even in low bandwidth environments; and our ENVI® image analysis software that analyzes virtually any geospatial data type.
Revenue, Operating Income and Backlog:    Revenue for our Space and Intelligence Systems segment in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1,921 million, $1,902 million and $1,899 million, respectively. Segment operating income in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $336 million, $311 million and $288 million, respectively. The percentage of our revenue contributed by this segment in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 31 percent, 32 percent and 32 percent, respectively. The percentages of this segment’s revenue under contracts directly with end customers and under contracts with prime contractors in fiscal 2018 were approximately 72 percent and 28 percent, respectively. In fiscal 2018, this segment had a diverse portfolio of over 200 programs. Some of this segment’s more significant programs in fiscal 2018 included SENSOR, GOES-R and GPS and various classified programs. The percentages of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2018 represented by this segment’s largest program by revenue and ten largest programs by revenue were approximately 9 percent and 48 percent, respectively. The percentage of this segment’s revenue in fiscal 2018 that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 93 percent. For a general description of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated thereunder and of cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price contracts, see “Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts” of this Report.
The funded backlog for this segment was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of each of fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additional information regarding funded backlog is provided under “Item 1. Business - Funded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see “Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

International Business
Revenue from products and services exported from the U.S., including foreign military sales, or manufactured or rendered abroad in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.3 billion (21 percent of our revenue), $1.3 billion (22 percent of our revenue) and $1.2 billion (20 percent of our revenue), respectively. Most of our international sales were derived from our Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Financial information regarding our domestic and international operations, including long-lived assets, is contained in Note 22: Business Segments in the Notes and is incorporated herein by reference.
The majority of our international marketing activities are conducted through subsidiaries that operate in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Australia and Canada. We have also established international marketing organizations and several regional sales offices. For further information regarding our international subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 of this Report.
Fiscal 2018 international revenue came from a large number of countries, and no single foreign country accounted for more than 5 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to remain competitive in international markets, we also sometimes enter into offset agreements or recourse or vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain customers.
We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and internationally. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or government customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. Revenue from indirect sales channels represented approximately 10 percent, 11 percent and 15 percent of total revenue and 47 percent, 38 percent and 62 percent of international revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The particular economic, social and political conditions for business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those encountered by businesses in the U.S. We believe that the overall business risk for our international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic businesses as a whole. A description of the types of risks to which we are subject in our international business is contained in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. In our opinion, these risks are partially mitigated by the diversification of our international business and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance payments, progress payments and other similar payments.
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Many of our competitors in each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness. We frequently “partner” or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. Our principal competitors include BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, L-3 Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Motorola Solutions, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins. 
Principal Customers; Government Contracts
The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 75 percent, 74 percent and 77 percent, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2018. Additional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided under “Item 1. Business — Description of Business by Segment” of this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from contracts with departments and agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales in our Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems segments are made directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default based on performance.

Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”) and multi-vendor IDIQ contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under such contracts.
Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus payment of a fee and fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fee that may increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results compared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of an award fee determined at the customer’s discretion based on our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples include certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, charitable contributions, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs.
Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of target cost up to a negotiated ceiling price, which is higher than the target cost, but carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive from the U.S. Government either milestone payments totaling 100 percent of the contract price or monthly progress payments in amounts equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract. Our production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.
As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government are dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from various military, political, economic and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of re-procurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.
Funded Backlog
Total Company-wide funded backlog was approximately $5.2 billion, $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion at the end of fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The determination of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and development and production contracts of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature. The level of order activity related to U.S. Government programs can be affected by timing of U.S. Government funding authorizations and project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others.
We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the case of U.S. Government customers, appropriated. In fiscal 2019, we expect to convert to revenue approximately 56 percent of our total funded backlog as of the end of fiscal 2018. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control.
Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development (“R&D”) costs, which include R&D for commercial products and services and independent R&D related to government products and services, as well as concept formulation studies and technology development that occurs on certain bid and proposal efforts, in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $311 
 10

million, $310 million and $305 million, respectively. A portion of our independent R&D costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored R&D costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development of new products and services and to building technological capability in various markets. 
Customer-sponsored R&D costs are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements, principally U.S. Government-sponsored contracts requiring us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance or other specifications (such as designs). This research helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Customer-sponsored research costs are accounted for principally by the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method and included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities, and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. As of June 29, 2018, we held approximately 1,750 U.S. patents and 1,370 foreign patents, and had approximately 150 U.S. patent applications pending and 210 foreign patent applications pending. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business and the operations of our business segments, we do not consider our business or any business segment to be materially dependent on any single patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements have generated income in past years and may do so in the future, there can be no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. With regard to certain patents, the U.S. Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also considered to be a valuable asset.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly with regard to waste and emissions. The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve. We believe that we have complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and prevention goals. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates to businesses or operations we no longer own, but for which we have retained certain environmental liabilities. We did not spend material amounts on environmental-related capital projects in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Based on currently available information, we do not expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 or over the next several years to protect the environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords, to be material or to have a material impact on our competitive position or financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations, and such expenditures may increase in future years. If future treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present estimates of those expenditures. 
Additional information regarding environmental and regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report and in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies and Note 23: Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes.
Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions, such as domestic and international requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers, including the European Union’s Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not applicable to most equipment produced by our segments. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products.
 11

Wireless communications, whether radio, satellite or telecommunications, are also subject to governmental regulation. Equipment produced in our Communication Systems segment, in particular, is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We are also required to comply with technical operating and licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics, needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent on suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent on one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Although we have been affected by financial and performance issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of natural disasters, or the RoHS environmental regulations in the European Union or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. These events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain electronic components, such as lead-free components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain shortages. As of June 29, 2018, these component shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our business. For further discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S.  Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Employees
We had approximately 17,500 employees at the end of fiscal 2018. Approximately 95 percent of our employees as of the end of fiscal 2018 were located in the U.S. A significant number of our employees possess a U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a number of independent contractors. Approximately 600 of our U.S. employees are working under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and worker representatives. These collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated at various times over the next three years as they expire. We have historically renegotiated these agreements without significant disruption to operating activities. For certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
