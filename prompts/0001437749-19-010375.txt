General
 
AVX, a Delaware Corporation, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1989. AVX Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “AVX” or the “Company”) is a leading worldwide manufacturer, supplier, and reseller of a broad line of electronic components, interconnect, sensing and control devices, and related products. Electronic components and connector, sensing and control products manufactured or resold by AVX are used in many types of end use products, including those in telecommunications, automotive, transportation, energy harvesting, consumer electronics, military/aerospace, medical, computer, and industrial markets. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st of each year. Throughout this report, we refer to fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 to reference the years ended March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
 
Our electronic component products include ceramic and tantalum capacitors, film capacitors, varistors, filters, passive and active electronic antennas, and other components manufactured in our facilities throughout the world, by other manufacturing suppliers and, through March 31, 2019, components manufactured by Kyocera Corporation of Japan (“Kyocera”), a public company and our majority stockholder which owns approximately 72% of our outstanding common stock. We also sell electronic interconnect, sensing and control devices manufactured in our facilities and by other manufacturing suppliers.
 
We are organized by product line with four main product groups: Ceramic Components; Tantalum Components; Advanced Components; and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices. Historically, KED Resale reported as its own product group, but it has now been combined with Advance Components. Our reportable segments are based on the types of products from which we generate revenues and how management assesses performance and makes operating decisions related to these products. We had two reportable segments as of March 31, 2019: Electronic Components; and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices. The product groups of Ceramic Components, Tantalum Components and Advanced Components have been aggregated into the Electronic Components reportable segment. The Electronic Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic capacitors, RF thick and thin film components, surface mount and leaded tantalum capacitors, surface mount and leaded film capacitors, ceramic and film power capacitors, super capacitors, EMI filters (bolt in and surface mount), thick and thin film packages of multiple integrated components, varistors, thermistors, inductors, resistive products, and passive and active electronic antennas manufactured by us or purchased from other manufacturers for resale. On April 30, 2018, AVX, through its subsidiary, AVX Interconnect Europe GmbH, acquired KUMATEC Sondermaschinenbau & Kunstoffverarbeitung, GmbH (“Kumatec”) for $12.9 million, net of cash acquired and debt assumed. The Kumatec business has been included in the Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices segment. The reportable segments have been presented in accordance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's (the “SEC”) aggregation criteria and quantitative thresholds. The aggregation criteria consist of similar economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, customer classes, and distribution channels. Sales and operating results from these reportable segments are shown in the tables below. Segment revenue and profit information is presented in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have a corporate administration group consisting of finance, legal, environmental, health & safety (“EH&S”), and administrative functions.
 
Our customers consist of multi-national original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, independent electronic component distributors, and electronic manufacturing service providers, or EMSs. We market our products through our own direct sales force and independent manufacturers' representatives, based upon market characteristics and demands. We coordinate our sales, marketing, and manufacturing organizations by strategic customer account and globally by region.
 
We sell our products to customers in a broad array of industries, such as telecommunications, information technology hardware, automotive electronics, medical devices and instrumentation, industrial instrumentation, transportation, energy harvesting, defense and aerospace electronic systems, and consumer electronics.
 
Our principal strategic advantages include:
 
Creating Technology Leadership. We have research and development locations in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at every one of our manufacturing sites. We developed numerous new products and product extensions during fiscal 2019 in addition to those added through our acquisition activity. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Our research scientists and design engineers are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers as consumers and businesses demand more advanced electronic solutions to manage their everyday lives and businesses. Our engineers are continually working to enhance our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity, and yield, while reducing manufacturing costs.
Providing a Broad Product Line. We believe that the breadth and quality of our product line and our ability to respond quickly to our customers’ design and delivery requirements make us a provider of choice for our multi-national customer base. We differentiate ourselves by providing our customers with a broad line of electronic component and interconnect, sensing and control solutions. This array of products allows our customers to streamline their purchasing and supply organization. Due to our broad product offering, none of our products individually represents a material portion of our revenues.
Maintaining the Lowest Cost, Highest Quality Manufacturing Organization. Excluding our acquisition activity, we have invested approximately $296 million over the past three fiscal years to upgrade and enhance our worldwide manufacturing facilities and capabilities with respect to the manufacture of ceramic, tantalum, and advanced components as well as interconnect, sensing and control devices. In order to reduce the cost of production, our strategy has included the transfer to, and expansion of, manufacturing operations in countries such as China, Czechia, El Salvador, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, and Vietnam.
Globally Coordinating our Marketing, Distribution, and Manufacturing Facilities. We believe that our global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows us to provide quality products on a timely basis to our global customers. We provide enhanced services and responsiveness to our customers by maintaining significant manufacturing and warehouse operations in regions where we market the majority of our products. As of March 31, 2019, we had 32 manufacturing facilities located in 16 different countries around the world. As our customers continue to expand their global production capabilities, we are ideally situated to meet their design and supply requirements.

Products
 
We offer an extensive line of electronic component products providing passive and active component solutions for our customers. Passive electronic components do not require power to operate. Such components adjust and regulate voltage and current, store energy, and filter frequencies. Active electronic components, which include amplifying components such as our active antenna components, require power in some way to make them function. In fiscal 2019, sales of Electronic Components represented approximately 72% of our net sales and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices represented approximately 28% of our net sales. Additional financial information concerning our Electronic Components and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices segments is set forth in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Electronic Components
 
Our strategic focus on the growing use of electronic components is reflected in our investment, excluding the cost of business acquired, of approximately $197 million in facilities and equipment used to manufacture electronic components during the past three fiscal years. Electronic Components accounted for approximately 72% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. We believe that sales of electronic components will continue to expand in the worldwide electronics market because technological advances in the markets that we serve have been constantly expanding the number and type of applications for these products.
 
We manufacture and resell a broad line of ceramic and tantalum electrolytic capacitors in many different sizes and configurations. Tantalum and ceramic components are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits and are best suited for applications requiring low to medium capacitance values. However, with current capacitance range extensions, we are seeing more demand for higher capacitance (“High CV”) products that increase the demand for certain products we sell. Capacitance is the measure of the capacitor's ability to store electric energy. Generally, ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, and tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at medium capacitance values. The net sales of tantalum and ceramic capacitors accounted for approximately 62% of our Electronic Component segment net sales in fiscal 2019.
 
We also manufacture and resell a broad line of advanced electronic components to fill the special needs of our customers. Our family of advanced components includes specialized ceramic, tantalum and film capacitors, polymer and EDLC capacitors, high energy/voltage power capacitors, passive and active antennas and varistors. Our advanced product engineers work with some customers’ in-house technical staffs to design and manufacture customized products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of custom products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with customers with respect to our complete product line, and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Sales of advanced electronic components accounted for approximately 38% of Electronic Component segment net sales in fiscal 2019.
 
Interconnect, Sensing and Control
 
We manufacture and resell high-quality electronic connectors, interconnect systems, and sensing and control devices for use in various industries. Our product lines include a variety of industry-standard connectors as well as products designed specifically for our customers' unique applications. An expanding portion of the electronics market for Interconnect, Sensing and Control products is the automotive market, with applications throughout a vehicle, including engine control, transmission control, audio, brakes, lighting, and stability and safety control systems. We produce fine pitch connectors used in portable devices such as notebook computers, tablets, GPS, and other hand held devices. In addition, we offer specialty connectors designed to address customer specific applications across a wide range of products and end markets, including the expanding LED, LCD, and medical devices and hardware markets. Excluding acquisition related spending, we have invested approximately $95 million in facilities and equipment over the past three years, as we continue to focus on new product development and enhancement of production capabilities for our Interconnect, Sensing and Control business. Sales of Interconnect, Sensing and Control products accounted for approximately 28% of net sales in fiscal 2019.
 
KED Resale
 
We had a non-exclusive license to distribute and sell select Kyocera-manufactured electronic component and connector products to our customers in certain geographical regions outside of Japan that terminated on January 1, 2018. The Kyocera KDP, KCP and KCD electronic components we marketed and sold included ceramic capacitors, RF modules, frequency control devices, SAW devices, sensor products, actuators, and acoustic devices. Sales of these products accounted for approximately 1% of net sales in fiscal 2019. For additional information regarding the Company’s relationship with Kyocera, see below “AVX and Kyocera – Resale Sales Channel Changes” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Relationship with Kyocera and Related Transactions.”
 
AVX and Kyocera – Resale Sales Channel Changes
 
In December 2016, Kyocera notified AVX pursuant to the Products Supply and Distribution Agreement of its intent, effective January 1, 2018, to market its manufactured electronic and interconnect products globally using Kyocera’s sales force rather than continuing to have AVX resell such products in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Kyocera will pay commissions to AVX on sales by Kyocera, in the applicable territories, of products designed into customer applications by AVX prior to January 1, 2018 of 2.0% in calendar year 2018, 1.5% in calendar year 2019, and 1.0% in calendar year 2020. Sales of Kyocera resale products by AVX were $19.0 million and related operating profit was $3.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
 
We place a high priority on solving customers’ electronic component design challenges and responding to their needs. In order to better serve our customers, we frequently designate teams consisting of marketing, field application engineering, research and development, and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements. We expense costs related to these activities as incurred.
 
Approximately 27%, 42%, and 31% of our net sales for fiscal 2019 were to our customers in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, respectively. Financial information for these geographic regions is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. The section “Risk Factors,” contained herein, provides a discussion of risks associated with our non-U.S. operations.
 
We market our products worldwide through our own dedicated direct sales personnel that serve our major OEM and EMS customers. We also have a large network of independent electronic component distributors and independent manufacturers’ representatives who sell our products throughout the world. We have regional sales and design application personnel in strategic locations to provide technical and sales support for these independent manufacturers’ representatives and independent electronic component distributors. We believe that this combination of sales channels provides a high level of market penetration and efficient coverage of our customers on a cost-effective basis.
 
Our customers use our products in a wide variety of applications. In order to maximize growth opportunities, our engineering and sales teams maintain close relationships with OEM, EMS, and electronic component distributor customers. Our largest customers may vary from year to year, and no customer has a long-term commitment to purchase our products. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales. As of March 31, 2018 and 2019, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. Because we are a supplier to several significant manufacturers across a broad-base of electronic devices industries and because of the cyclical nature of these industries, the significance of any one customer can vary from one period to the next.
 
We also have qualified products under various specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center (“DSCC”) and European Space Agency (“ESA”), and approved under certain U.S. and non-U.S., foreign military specifications.
 
Typically, independent electronic component and interconnect device distributors handle a wide variety of products and fill orders for many customers. The sales terms under non-exclusive agreements with independent electronic component and interconnect device distributors may vary by distributor and by geographic region. Such agreements may include stock rotation and ship-from-stock and debit (“ship and debit”) programs. Stock rotation is a program whereby distributors are allowed to return qualified inventory semi-annually, for credit equal to a certain percentage, primarily limited to 5%, of the previous six months’ net sales. In the United States, we may use a ship and debit program under which we may grant pricing adjustments to assist distributors in meeting competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end customers. Ship and debit programs require a request from the distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part of a sale to the distributor’s end customer from the distributor’s stock. In addition, certain agreements with distributors may include special incentive discounts based on the amount of product ordered or shipped. Our agreements with independent electronic component and interconnect device distributors generally also require that we repurchase qualified inventory from the distributor in the event that we terminate the distributor agreement or discontinue a particular product offering.
 
We had a backlog of orders of approximately $280 million at March 31, 2017, $535 million at March 31, 2018, and $550 million at March 31, 2019. Firm orders, primarily with delivery dates within six months of order placement, are included in backlog. Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products. Customer-provided forecasts of product usage and anticipated usage of inventory at consignment locations are not included in backlog. If demand falls below customers’ forecasts, or if customers do not effectively control their inventory, they may cancel or reschedule their planned shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without any penalty. Backlog fluctuates from year to year due, in part, to changes in customer inventory levels, changes to consignment inventory arrangements, order patterns, product delivery lead times in the industry, and the completion of acquisitions. Accordingly, the backlog outstanding at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the level of business expected in any ensuing period since many orders are placed and delivered within the same period. In addition, the increased use of vendor-managed inventory and similar consignment type arrangements tend to limit the significance of backlog as future use and sale of such inventory is not typically reflected in backlog.

Research, Development, and Engineering
 
Our emphasis on research and development is evidenced by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. Our research and development activities are carried out at facilities located in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at all of our manufacturing sites.
 
Our research and development effort and our operational-level engineering effort place a priority on the design and development of product extensions, innovative new products, and improved manufacturing processes as well as engineering advances in existing product lines and manufacturing operations. Other areas of emphasis include material synthesis and the integration of components for applications requiring reduced size and lower manufacturing costs associated with circuit board assembly. Research, development, and engineering expenditures were approximately $31 million, $42 million, and $60 million during fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The 2018 and 2019 expenditures include the impact of the three businesses acquired during those years. The level of such spending can fluctuate as new products are transferred to full-scale production and process enhancements are implemented.
 
We own United States patents as well as corresponding patents in various other countries, and also have patent applications pending, although no individual patent or family of patents is material to the successful operation of our business. For discussion regarding our licensing arrangement with Kyocera, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Relationship with Kyocera and Related Transactions.”
 
Raw Materials
 
The costs of our products are influenced by a wide variety of raw materials, including tantalum and other minerals such as platinum, palladium, silver, nickel, gold, and copper as well as other chemicals and chemical mixes used in our manufacturing processes. The costs of these materials are subject to significant price fluctuation as well as occasional shortages. In some cases, raw materials cost increases may be offset by selling price increases, productivity improvements, and cost savings programs.
 
We are a major consumer of the world’s annual production of tantalum. Tantalum powder and wire are principal materials used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products. We purchase tantalum raw materials as well as processed powder and wire from suppliers in various parts of the world at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment and variations in the market.
 
As a key participant in Solutions for Hope, AVX was the first in its industry to validate a “closed tantalum pipe” process from the mine site to the customer. Furthermore, the “closed pipe” was validated under the Conflict-Free Smelter program in accordance with the principles of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank" Act) and the current Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) guidelines. During 2018 and 2019, and in the spirit of continuous improvement envisioned and enshrined by the OECD Due Diligence guidance, AVX continued to improve supply chain sustainability by using a geological science technique for mineral matching (Geological Passporting) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and surrounding regions. AVX has obtained the patent for this technology and invested in equipment at its facility, thus mitigating supply chain risk by reducing the cost and time required to validate the minerals and deliver them for manufacturing.
 
Since December 2011, AVX has only sourced tantalum powder and wire used in its tantalum capacitors from smelters that are compliant with the RBA/GeSI conflict-free smelter program. In 2012, AVX began using Validated Conflict-Free Tantalum, which comes from verified sources in the DRC and surrounding countries. AVX also observes the principles for other conflict minerals set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act (tin, tungsten, and gold) and the OECD guidelines for such minerals. AVX has implemented a Due Diligence Policy on Conflict Minerals, and actively engages in industry initiatives, including the Responsible Sourcing Initiative (“RMI”), the ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative (“iTSCi”), and the Better Sourcing Program (“BSP”) Supply Chain Platform. Further details of this effort are available in AVX’s annual Form SD filings under the Dodd-Frank Act at www.sec.gov.
 
Our continued efforts affirm our commitment to supply conflict-free minerals to our customers and to comply fully with the OECD guidelines and SEC regulations.
 
Competition
 
Markets for our products are highly competitive. We encounter aggressive and able competition in our various product lines from many domestic and non-U.S. manufacturers. Competitive factors in the markets include product quality and reliability, breadth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, global production presence, timely delivery, and price. We believe we are competitively positioned on each of these factors. The breadth of our product offering enables us to strengthen our market position by providing customers with one of the broadest selections of electronic components and interconnect, sensing and control devices available from any one source.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 15,100 full-time employees. This number is expected to fluctuate as some facilities are closed and additional facilities are brought online. At present, approximately 1,340 of these employees are employed in the United States, of which, approximately 140 are covered by collective-bargaining arrangements. In addition, some non-U.S. employees are members of trade and government-affiliated unions. Our relationship with our employee union groups is generally adequate to good. However, no assurance can be given that, in response to changing social and economic conditions and our actions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.

Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the United States and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate. These regulations include limitations on discharges into air and water; remediation requirements; chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and hazardous materials transportation, treatment, storage and disposal restrictions. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product designs, or to incur expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use, disposal, or storage, or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances, could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Based on our periodic reviews of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities, we believe that our operations are currently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 
We have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), state governmental agencies or other private parties as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), or equivalent non-U.S., state or local laws, for clean-up and response costs associated with certain sites at which remediation is required with respect to prior contamination. Because CERCLA or such non-U.S. and state statutes authorize joint and several liability, the regulatory authorities could seek to recover all clean-up costs from any one of the PRPs at a site despite the involvement of other PRPs. At certain sites, financially responsible PRPs other than AVX also are, or have been, involved in site investigation and clean-up activities. We believe that liability resulting from these sites will be apportioned between AVX and other PRPs.
 
To resolve our liability at the sites at which we have been named a PRP, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees with federal and state regulatory agencies governing the timing and nature of investigation and remediation. As is customary, the orders and decrees regarding sites where the PRPs are not themselves implementing the chosen remedy contain provisions allowing the EPA to reopen the agreement and seek additional amounts from settling PRPs in the event that certain contingencies occur, such as the discovery of significant new information about site conditions.
 
On June 3, 2010, AVX entered into an agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford, pursuant to which AVX is required to perform environmental remediation at a site referred to as the “Aerovox Site” (the “Site”), located in New Bedford, Massachusetts. AVX has substantially completed its obligations pursuant to such agreement with the EPA and the City of New Bedford with respect to the satisfaction of AVX’s federal law requirements. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has jurisdiction over the balance of the environmental remediation at the Site. AVX has submitted its proposed remedy, but until the state has approved such proposal, AVX cannot determine if additional groundwater and soil remediation will be required, if substantial material will have to be disposed of offsite, or if additional remediation techniques will be required, any of which could result in a more extensive and costly plan of remediation. Further, the Site and the remediation may be subject to additional scrutiny under other statutory procedures which could also add to the cost of remediation. We have a remaining accrual of $22.2 million at March 31, 2019, representing our current estimate of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the Site and neighboring properties using certain assumptions regarding the plan of remediation. Until all parties agree and remediation is complete, we cannot be certain there will be no additional cost relating to the Site.
 
We had total reserves of approximately $18.6 million and $26.4 million at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively, related to various environmental matters and sites, including those discussed above. These reserves are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as $3.3 million and $5.8 million in accrued expenses at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively, and $15.3 and $20.6 million in other non-current liabilities at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The amounts recorded for identified environmental liabilities are based on estimates. Periodically, we review amounts recorded and adjust them based upon additional legal and technical information that becomes available. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, regulatory actions, technology, and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure. Accordingly, these costs could differ from our current estimates.
 
On April 19, 2016, the Canadian Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (the “MoE”) issued a Director’s Order naming AVX Corporation, and others, as responsible parties with respect to a location in Hamilton, Ontario that was at one time the site of operations of Aerovox Canada, a former subsidiary of Aerovox Corporation, a predecessor of AVX. AVX has taken the position that any liability of Aerovox Canada for such site under the laws of Canada cannot be imposed on AVX. At present, it is unclear whether the MoE will seek to enforce such Canadian order against AVX. AVX intends to contest any such course of action that may be taken by the MoE.
 
In connection with the same location, Union Gas Limited and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Company filed suits in the Superior Court of Justice for Ontario, Canada, against AVX Corporation, Aerovox Corp. and Cooper Industries, LLC seeking to recover the costs of remediation of the site and for damages associated with alleged contamination of the site. Those suits were filed on April 18, 2018, but not served on AVX until October 11, 2018, and are in their initial stages. AVX is considering its legal options but intends to vigorously defend these matters.
 
We also operate, or did at one time, on other sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during AVX’s long history of manufacturing operations or prior to the start of operations by AVX. Even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental matters at certain sites, regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues. Once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated, we establish reserves or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs. A separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs. Our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries, which are not expected to be significant, but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party.
 
We are not involved in any pending or threatened environmental proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations. We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy. New environmental regulations may be enacted and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations. Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
