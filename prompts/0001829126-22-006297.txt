ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Legato Merger Corp. II.
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 14, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location.
 
In July 2021, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock (“founders’ shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.005 per share, to our initial stockholders. In November 2021, we effectuated a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 founders’ shares.
 
In August 2021, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our initial public offering (“IPO”), an aggregate of 240,000 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the stock dividend referred to above) (“representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.
 
On November 24, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 24,000,000 units. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one share of common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 1,045,000 units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $10,450,000. The Private Units were sold to our initial stockholders and EarlyBirdCapital and its designees. The Private Units are identical to the Units included in the Units sold in the IPO.
 
On December 1, 2021, as a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,600,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 126,000 Private Units at $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $1,260,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $280,140,000 has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO. As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, a total of 900,000 founder shares’ are no longer subject to forfeiture.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $15,660,526, consisting of $5,520,000 of underwriting fees, $9,660,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $480,526 of other offering costs. As of December 31, 2021, $1,100,031 of cash was held outside of the trust account established in connection with the IPO and is available for working capital purposes.
 
On December 22, 2021, the shares of Common Stock and Warrants included in the Units began separate trading.
