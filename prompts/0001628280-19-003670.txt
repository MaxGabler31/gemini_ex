ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Cloudera is the enterprise data cloud company. We empower people to transform data into clear and actionable insights through an integrated suite of data analytics and management products from the Edge to artificial intelligence (AI). Our portable, multi-cloud platform with common security, governance and data management functions underpins products that include streaming analytics at the edge, data engineering, data warehousing, real-time operational analytics, exploratory data science and machine learning offerings. Today these products are implemented in private and co-location datacenters, multiple public clouds and hybrid cloud environments with common data analytics and management capabilities across all workloads and architectures. Our offerings are based predominantly on open source software, utilizing data stored natively in public cloud object stores as well as in various open source data stores. Using our software, organizations are able to capitalize on vast amounts of data from a variety of sources to better serve and market to their customers, design connected products and services and protect their enterprises. 
We collaborate extensively with the global open source community, continuously innovating data management and analytics technologies to support Internet of Things (IoT), data warehousing and machine learning applications. We leverage the latest advances in infrastructure technology, such as containers and container orchestration software, to deliver our solutions across all major public clouds – Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud – as well as private cloud. Our shared data experience (SDX) technologies provide a common security, governance and management layer across all these environments, enabling customers to easily migrate data, comply with data privacy regulations and safeguard intellectual property. Customers can manage infrastructure, data and analytic workloads across these hybrid and multi-cloud environments through a single control plane. This flexibility and control allow customers to continually determine and implement the most cost‑efficient strategies for managing and analyzing their data, optimizing for cost, performance and data locality while avoiding cloud lock-in. 
We offer our software primarily on a subscription basis and focus our selling efforts on the largest corporate enterprises and public sector organizations globally. We target these organizations because they capture and manage the majority of the world’s data and operate highly complex information technology (IT) environments. These customers often demand the interaction of multiple analytic functions to perform the use cases required by their enterprises, and typically have data dispersed in public cloud and datacenters as well as geographically. We have developed a growing, vibrant ecosystem of systems integrators, software developers, resellers, OEMs, data systems vendors and public cloud providers to support the distribution of our solutions. As part of this ecosystem, we have formed strategic partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Intel Corporation to optimize our software for use with these strategic partners’ offerings. 
Our Offerings
Cloudera completed its merger with Hortonworks in January 2019, creating the world’s leading open source data management and analytics solutions provider. In addition to the complementary offerings of the two companies, we plan to combine our assets and technical expertise to deliver the industry’s first ‘Enterprise Data Cloud from the Edge to AI’. Our enterprise data cloud (EDC) will provide a public cloud-like experience everywhere for data anywhere. It will offer the agility, elasticity and ease-of-use of public cloud infrastructure across private cloud, hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud and all major public clouds. An EDC enables multiple analytic functions -- from real-time streaming at the edge to artificial intelligence -- working together on the same data to support the most demanding business use cases. An EDC is secure and governed, meeting the strict data privacy, compliance, data migration and metadata management requirements of large enterprises across all their environments. Lastly, an EDC is defined by openness, powered by open source software, open compute architectures and open data stores like Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we actively seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache 2.0 Software License. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
As of January 31, 2019, we had been granted 36 U.S. patents and had 18 U.S. patent applications pending. Our patents expire between 2020 and 2036. We also had 10 issued patents and four patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark registrations in some jurisdictions
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 2,947 full‑time employees. Of these employees, 1,697 are in the United States and 1,250 are in our international locations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
