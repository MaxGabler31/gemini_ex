Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation, diversified in vivo approaches designed to enable the body’s immune system to fight disease. Although we believe our approaches have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas, we are focused in oncology and have designed our technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to generate and/or expand tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells, or CTLs, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer via distinct mechanisms. G100, our lead product candidate, uses the body’s immune system in different ways that, we believe, addresses the shortcomings of other therapies and has the potential to treat a broad patient population. In the Fall of 2018, we elected to focus our resources on G100 and pause development of our other programs generated from our discovery platforms, ZVex® and GLAAS®, including a late-stage cancer vaccine program, CMB305. Building upon positive G100 data in multiple tumor types, including from a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, and after receiving feedback from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we are planning to further develop G100 with a potential first approval path in follicular lymphoma patients, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects thousands of patients annually.
Recent Events
On February 20, 2019, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a New Jersey corporation, or Parent, and Cascade Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or Purchaser (or together with Parent, Merck), pursuant to which we agreed to be acquired by Merck in an all-cash transaction for an approximate value of $300 million, representing an over three hundred percent premium over our stock’s closing price on the day prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser has commenced a tender offer, or Offer, to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock for $5.85 per share, to be paid to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The consummation of Purchaser’s pending Offer and subsequent Merger will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least one more than 50% of the total number of our shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that following the consummation of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable law, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company, the separate existence of Purchaser will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. We expect the Proposed Transaction to close early in the second quarter of 2019.
Additional information about the Proposed Transaction is set forth in our filings with the SEC.

G100 Product Development
G100 was developed from the GLAAS platform and activates both innate and adaptive immunity in the tumor microenvironment, including dendritic cells, to create an immune response against the tumor’s pre-existing, diverse set of antigens, including neoantigens. G100 contains a potent, synthetic, small molecule toll-like receptor-4, or TLR4, agonist called GLA, which stands for Glucopyranosyl Lipid A.
We have been developing G100 as a monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or FL, in a randomized Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. The monotherapy Phase 1b portion of the trial evaluated G100 with local radiation at multiple doses, and the randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial evaluated G100 with local radiation alone or in combination with the anti-PD-1 agent, Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), pursuant to a collaboration with Merck. In December 2017, we presented the first data from this trial at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting, and in March 2018 and at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2018, we reported longer-term follow-up data observing additional responses. The G100 monotherapy and pembrolizumab combination resulted in a 54% objective response rate, or ORR, with a 75% ORR in those patients who expressed a potential predictive biomarker related to high TLR4 expression (6/8 patients). These data compare favorably to the pembrolizumab monotherapy data presented at ASH 2017, which showed an 11% ORR in a separate follicular lymphoma study. In addition, 77% of patients in the combination arm experienced abscopal tumor shrinkage in un-injected tumors, compared to 54% of patients in the monotherapy arm. Given these clinical benefit data and G100’s continued favorable safety profile, and after receiving feedback from the FDA we are planning to develop G100 first in relapsed/refractory FL patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy – a patient population whom the FDA stated may represent an unmet medical need. In addition, we are evaluating development of G100 in other lymphomas and solid tumors.
We have received orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union for G100 in FL. Orphan drug designation provides certain benefits, such as research tax credits and waivers of certain regulatory fees, but does not provide any assurance of regulatory approval or expedite regulatory review. 
Our Strategy
In October 2018, we completed a portfolio review and made a strategic decision to focus on accelerating and expanding the development of G100. Based on the review of our CMB305 program in comparison to the G100 program, we discontinued our SYNOVATE Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with synovial sarcoma. We plan to seek external collaborators to explore the continued development of CMB305 in sarcoma. 
Our ongoing strategy is multi-faceted:

• | Develop product candidates to treat a broad patient population. We believe our product candidates may benefit a wide range of patients in both orphan diseases and larger indications because they are designed to create tumor-killing CTLs, could potentially target any tumor and have potential utility as both individual therapies and in combination with multiple types of other anti-cancer mechanisms of action.

• | Rapidly advance first-in-class immuno-oncology product candidates through clinical development. We intend to continue to execute a focused clinical development plan that takes selected product candidates through approval. We are initially focused on indications with an unmet need in targeted patient populations, such as G100 in relapsed and refractory FL patients.


• | Position Immune Design to potentially play a broad role in the immuno-oncology treatment paradigm. Our agents are designed to work either individually or together, as well as with multiple other mechanisms of action. In addition to our ongoing clinical collaboration combining G100 with a checkpoint inhibitor, we intend to explore additional combinations with other immuno-oncology approaches to demonstrate this broad potential benefit.


• | Selectively monetize non-oncology indications, while retaining optionality for future internal development. ZVex and GLAAS also have potential applications in infectious disease and allergy. We have licensed the right to use the GLAAS platform in specific infectious disease indications to large pharmaceutical companies. These collaborations provide us with both near- and long-term potential revenue and external validation of our technology, while preserving optionality for future growth beyond oncology.


• | Establish infrastructure and capabilities to support the future commercialization of our products. Our management team has extensive experience developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products and as our product candidates advance, we intend to add the appropriate additional expertise to maximize the potential for successful product launches and franchise management. In certain instances, we will seek partners to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

Our Approaches to Treating Cancer
Immuno-oncology broadly refers to the modulation of the immune system to eradicate tumor cells, and is often colloquially divided into two categories: “create and expand” the anti-tumor immune response and “remove the brakes” placed on the immune response by the tumor’s defenses.
We believe alteration of the tumor microenvironment and trafficking of CTLs into the tumor are increasingly being recognized as important for the efficacy of any immunotherapy. Our platforms focus on the “create and expand” category and are designed to generate strong, tumor-specific CTLs and effector cells in vivo that infiltrate the tumor (known as making the tumor “hot”), while addressing many of the shortcomings of previous approaches. Our platforms can generate individual product candidates, such as G100, or complimentary product candidates administered in sequence, such as CMB305. Additionally, we designed our therapies to be combined with other immuno-oncology therapeutic mechanisms such as checkpoint inhibitors from the “remove the brakes” category, which we believe will generate a greater anti-tumor response.
In addition to G100, we are also investigating the potential use of our ZVex platform for intratumoral injection. For example, we presented preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in 2016 and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting in 2017 describing the intratumoral administration of a ZVex vector designed to generate localized expression of IL-12, a potent modulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. The results demonstrated strong local and systemic anti-tumor efficacy in multiple murine models, and this use of the ZVex platform offers a potential expansion opportunity of our intratumoral approach beyond G100.
Therapeutic Applications Outside Oncology
Although immuno-oncology development is robust with therapies for an estimated 10 liquid and 18 solid tumors in development and with a market for immuno-oncology therapies projected to approach $35 billion by 2023, the broader market for immunotherapy applications also includes infectious and allergic diseases. The worldwide infectious diseases vaccine market garnered approximately $30 billion in sales in 2014 and the market for allergy therapies and diagnostics is projected to reach $41 billion by 2022. Beyond oncology, we believe our technologies offer several promising applications in the fields of infectious and allergic diseases. We have been executing on our strategy to partner the use of our GLAAS platform in individual indications outside of oncology in infectious and allergic diseases, which provide potential downstream revenue while preserving growth opportunity in the future. 
Infectious Diseases
Historically, antigens have been used with sub-optimal immune adjuvants and have mainly focused on generating antibodies, which have been limited by low affinity and a narrow spectrum of activity. We believe using GLA, a novel molecular adjuvant, combined with infectious disease antigens will boost pre-existing T cells and trigger a broad antibody response, allowing for diverse antigen recognition. The results of these trials that we have reviewed to date support the finding of increased magnitude and breadth of the antibody response.

We have a preclinical vaccine product candidate called G103 to treat herpes simplex virus type 2, or HSV2. G103 consists of several recombinantly expressed proteins adjuvanted with a specific formulation of GLA. In October 2014, we announced a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi, to develop G103 along with additional assets contributed by us and Sanofi Pasteur. 
Allergic Diseases
We believe allergic diseases represent an exciting area for the application of GLAAS. Allergies to pollen or food often occur because of aberrant immune reactions, which are characterized by helper T cells producing signals that induce other immune cells to cause the allergy symptoms. We have a large set of preclinical data demonstrating that certain formulations of GLAAS, when given prophylactically or therapeutically with or without the allergen, can shift the responses in a way that results in significant protection from allergy symptoms. In essence, the immune system can be taught to redirect the T cells to respond in better ways. 
Manufacturing
Overview
We are continuing to establish manufacturing processes and supply agreements for all of the components used in our product candidates to support ongoing and planned clinical trials, primarily bulk and formulated GLA for our G100 product candidate. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products used in our clinical trials in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We may continue to rely on CMOs to develop and manufacture our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with our CMOs that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates and manufacturing processes.
GLAAS Product Candidates
Manufacturing for the GLAAS platform generally encompasses the synthesis of bulk GLA, its formulations and the fill-finish of formulated GLA. We have established a supply chain for bulk GLA and our stable-emulsion formulation, referred to as GLA-SE. Our synthetic process for the manufacture of bulk GLA is a trade secret, and we retain control and ownership of this process. Our CMOs also perform release and stability testing on the bulk GLA. The scale of the GLA synthetic manufacturing process is adequate to support commercial production for our G100 product candidate.
We have also contracted with a CMO to formulate and fill-finish our GLA-SE drug product. We have manufactured multiple lots in support of our clinical trials and those of our partners. The formulation process utilizes technology that is readily scalable to support commercial manufacturing of our product candidates and to supply our licensees. Release and stability testing on the GLA-SE drug product is contracted to several CMOs.
Intellectual Property
Overview
Our intellectual property strategy is to protect our technologies by filing patent applications and obtaining patent rights both in the United States and in foreign countries that we consider important to our current and future business. In addition, we have acquired and will seek to acquire, as needed or desired, intellectual property rights of others through assignment or license to complement and enhance our portfolio of patent rights. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.

The 20-year projected expiration dates for our pending patent applications range from 2027 to 2037, not giving effect to any potential extensions and assuming payment of all associated fees.
Licensing Agreements
We have in-licensed both exclusive and non-exclusive intellectual property rights related to our discovery platform technologies, including the following:
Second Amended and Restated License Agreement with the Infectious Disease Research Institute
In December 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated license agreement with IDRI, and paid an upfront fee of $2.3 million, pursuant to which we license certain patent rights, know-how and technologies relating to our GLAAS discovery platform, including products and formulations containing GLA and another synthetic TLR4 agonist referred to as SLA. The original license agreement with IDRI was entered into in July 2008, and the first restated agreement was entered into with IDRI in November 2010. We also entered into a separate agreement with IDRI in November 2015 to license a related patent in the field of cancer. The patent rights licensed from IDRI are directed to GLA and SLA, compositions and formulations that include these molecules, and methods of using these compositions to elicit or enhance an immune response. The licensed patent rights cover all of our GLAAS platform products in clinical development. Under the license agreement, we generally obtained an exclusive license in the fields of oncology, allergy, addiction and select infectious disease indications, which vary depending on the licensed GLA or SLA product. In addition, we have an option to obtain additional exclusive licenses in select infectious disease indications for GLA and SLA products. IDRI has retained exclusive rights with respect to infectious diseases and other indications not licensed to us. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products to which we have exclusive rights. We and IDRI are not permitted to sell or transfer GLA or SLA outside our respective exclusive fields.
We recognized $500,000, zero and $925,000 in license-related milestone fees, which were expensed in research and development expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are obligated to pay IDRI in aggregate up to $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in additional payments for the first and each subsequent exclusive licensed product we develop, and $1.3 million and $625,000, respectively, for the first and each subsequent non-exclusive licensed product we develop based on the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones. We are obligated to pay IDRI a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products that varies according to the product and indication, as well 
5

as a percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, ranging from the low double-digits to the middle single-digits. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the relevant licensed patents or 12 years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is longer. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2028 with respect to GLA products and 2032 with respect to SLA products.
Our license agreement with IDRI will remain in effect until the expiration of our payment obligations under the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement at any time with advance written notice. IDRI may terminate the license agreement if we challenge any of the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or upon certain insolvency events.
Exclusive License Agreement with Caltech
In January 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Caltech, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license under certain patent rights directed to the production of dendritic cell-targeted therapeutic and prophylactic immunization strategies, with the right to sublicense. In September 2009, we exercised an option to expand the field of use to include human cancer applications. Additionally, we have a non-exclusive, sub-licensable worldwide license to unpatented know-how related to the licensed patents. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use diligent commercial efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and to make them available to the developing world.
In partial consideration for the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, we issued shares of our common stock to Caltech. We are obligated to pay Caltech a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to a non-material annual minimum, as well as a mid single-digit to low double-digit percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, which percentage depends on the stage of development when the sublicense was granted. We are also obligated to pay Caltech up to an aggregate of $1.5 million in additional payments based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the relevant licensed patent rights. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2027.
Our license agreement with Caltech will remain in effect until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights or the end of our payment obligations under the license agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or certain insolvency events.
Exclusive License Agreement with UNC Chapel Hill
In January 2013, we entered into a license agreement with UNC Chapel Hill, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to certain modified retroviral vectors, including a license under all patent rights owned or controlled by UNC Chapel Hill covering such vectors. In January 2015, we exercised an option to obtain an exclusive license under these patent rights. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently pursue the development and commercialization of licensed products, and we are required to meet certain performance milestones relating to the development of licensed products.
We will owe UNC Chapel Hill one or more non-material milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the development or regulatory approval of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay UNC Chapel Hill non-material annual renewal fees, a low double-digit percentage share of any payments that we receive from sub-licensees, and a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products by us or our sub-licensees. Our royalty obligations continue for the life of the licensed patent rights, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, and in any event will cease upon termination or expiration of the license agreement. Currently, we expect that the last-to-expire licensed patent in the United States will expire in 2028.
Our license agreement with UNC Chapel Hill will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights, or, if no patents issue from the licensed patent rights, in January 2028. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon advance written notice to UNC Chapel Hill. UNC Chapel Hill may terminate the license agreement in the event of our uncured material breach or if we become insolvent, and either party may terminate the license agreement for uncured fraud, willful misconduct, or illegal conduct of the other party.
License Agreement with TheraVectys SA
In October 2016, we entered into a license agreement with TheraVectys SA, or TVS, pursuant to which we received a field limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable license for oncology uses to certain current and future intellectual property rights owned, controlled and licensed by TVS relating to lentiviral vector technologies. The license agreement was entered into simultaneously with a settlement agreement resolving litigation brought by TVS against us related to our use of a third party contract manufacturing organization, Henogen, for the manufacture of our LV305 product candidate. We resolved the TVS allegations pursuant to the settlement agreement, and we additionally received certain present and future intellectual property rights under the license agreement, including, among other things, a sublicense to certain patent rights licensed by TVS from the Institut Pasteur.
6

We will owe TVS milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for each licensed product, in the aggregate amount of up to $4.8 million, except that the first two milestones payments are waived for CMB305/LV305. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a single commercial milestone payment for each product that achieves a specified net sales amount. We will owe royalties to TVS on product sales that are made directly by us or our affiliates, subject to certain royalty-offset provisions. For the first four products, including LV305/CMB305, royalties will be based on a low-single digit percentage of net sales, and for subsequent products, tiered royalties will be based on low-to-mid-single digit percentages of net sales. TVS will also receive a mid-single digit percentage of revenues that we receive for sublicensing the licensed intellectual property.
The term of the license agreement expires upon the last to expire valid patent claim that is licensed to us. The license agreement may also be terminated by either party for customary reasons, such as an uncured material breach by the other party, or the other party’s insolvency. We may terminate the license agreement upon thirty days’ prior written notice to TVS.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi Pasteur
In October 2014, we entered into a collaboration for the development of a herpes simplex virus, or HSV, immune therapy with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi. We and Sanofi Pasteur are each contributing product candidates to the collaboration: Sanofi Pasteur is contributing HSV-529, a clinical-stage, replication-defective HSV vaccine product candidate, and we contribute G103, our preclinical trivalent vaccine product candidate. The collaboration will explore the potential of various combinations of agents, including leveraging our GLAAS platform, with the goal to select the best potential immune therapy for patients. We will develop the products jointly through Phase 2 clinical trials, at which point Sanofi Pasteur intends to continue development of the most promising candidate and be responsible for commercialization. Sanofi Pasteur will bear the costs of all preclinical and clinical development, and we will provide a specific formulation of GLA from the GLAAS platform at our cost through Phase 2 studies. We are eligible to receive future milestone and royalty payments on any licensed product developed from the collaboration.
Exclusive License Agreement with MedImmune
We are party to a license agreement with MedImmune LLC, or MedImmune, dated October 2010, pursuant to which we granted MedImmune a worldwide, sub-licensable, exclusive license to use GLA to develop and sell vaccines in an infectious disease indication. Under the license agreement, MedImmune is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a licensed product in certain markets and to market and sell licensed products in any country where it obtains regulatory approval. 
Under the license agreement, if certain development regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved, MedImmune is obligated to make additional aggregate payments of up to $72.5 million. We have recognized no revenue for the achievement of milestones under this license agreement. MedImmune is also obligated to pay us a low double-digit percentage share of non-royalty payments that it receives from sub-licensees and a mid single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, which royalty is subject to reduction under certain circumstances. Under our license agreement with IDRI, we are obligated to share with IDRI a percentage of payments received from third-party licensees, including MedImmune. MedImmune’s royalty obligations will continue, on a country-by-country basis, for at least 10 years after the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in the applicable country and will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, for the life of the licensed patents that cover the sale of the applicable product in the applicable country.
Our license agreement with MedImmune will remain in effect until the later of October 2060 or the expiration of MedImmune’s payment obligations. MedImmune may terminate the license agreement at any time with advance written notice. We or MedImmune may terminate the license agreement in case of the other party’s uncured material breach or upon certain insolvency events.
Previously, we were parties to two additional license agreements with MedImmune, each dated October 2010, pursuant to which we granted MedImmune an exclusive license to use GLA to develop and sell vaccines in two additional infectious disease indications, which license agreements have each been terminated. Under the terminated license agreements, we recognized no revenue for the achievement of development milestones for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Exclusive License Agreement with Sanofi
In August 2014, we granted Sanofi an exclusive license to use the GLAAS platform to discover, develop and commercialize products to treat peanut allergy. On December 6, 2018, Sanofi provided notice terminating this license agreement as of June 6, 2019. We recognized no milestone revenue under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, and $7.0 million in milestone revenue under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our product candidates. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates our current product candidates as biological drug products, or biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act and related regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, revocation of a biologics license, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import detention, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion and post-market surveillance of our products.
The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any future product candidates or approval of product or manufacturing changes, new disease indications, or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
Biologics Marketing Approval
The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests; submission of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use or uses; pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and FDA approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, which must occur before a biologic can be marketed or sold.
Before testing any compound in human subjects, a company must develop extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act and related regulations.
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an initial IND application must be submitted to the FDA. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on clinical 
8

hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
A study sponsor is also required to submit to NIH for public posting on NIH’s clinical trial website, details about certain active clinical trials and clinical trial results. For purposes of developing product candidates for BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in phases that may overlap:

• | Phase 1—the investigational biologic is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, reactivity, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These studies may also gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational products may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.


• | Phase 2—studies are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to assess the efficacy of the investigational product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3—when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the investigational product may be effective and may have an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.

All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires the pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval.
The Biologic License Application Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Each BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
The FDA will initially review the BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. Under the FDA’s procedures, the agency has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
9

During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure that the benefits of the biologic outweighs the risks. A REMS may include various elements depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. These elements may range from a medication guide or patient package insert to training and certification requirements for prescribers and/or pharmacies to safe use conditions that must be in place before the drug is dispersed. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the BLA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS that the agency has determined is acceptable.
Certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the Company’s request or by the agency’s initiative.
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs and biological products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug or biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug or biologic that is approved for the orphan designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.
For investigational products that are intended to treat serious diseases, certain mechanisms may expedite the FDA approval process. For example, FDA may grant Priority Review designation for a product that could provide significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority Review sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA’s filing of the BLA, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review designation does not, however, change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. Another potential approach is Fast Track designation, which a sponsor can request at any time during the development process to facilitate development and expedite review of a product intended to treat a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation involves early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor, which often leads to earlier approval. Breakthrough Therapy designation is another approach that is intended to expedite development and review of a product that is intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. Like Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation provides a sponsor with the opportunity to obtain early and intensive guidance from FDA for an efficient drug development program.
After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA, it will either communicate to the sponsor that it will approve the product, or issue a complete response letter to communicate that it will not approve the BLA in its current form and to inform the sponsor of changes that the sponsor must make or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the FDA can approve the application, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the sponsor may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine that the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from analyses provided in the BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing product approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. Conversely, the results of Phase 4 clinical trials can raise new safety or efficacy issues that were not apparent during the original review of the product, which may result in product restrictions or even withdrawal of the product approval. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
10

Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and/or dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of a REMs, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study or trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product requirements to conduct additional studies or trials, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting annual reports, and reporting biological product deviations. Manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality, purity and potency characteristics that it purports to have. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, refuse to approve any BLA or other application, force us to recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action.
The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of biologics. While doctors may prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use as long as consistent with any REMS restrictions, if applicable, a company can only make claims about a product that are consistent with its FDA approval, and the Company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled or warning letters, corrective advertising requirements, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution, and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, as well as state authorities, recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
Finally, post-approval modifications to a licensed biological product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental BLA, which would require FDA review and approval.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, created a licensure framework for biosimilar products, or biosimiliars, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition from biosimiliars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an abbreviated application for licensure of a biologic that is “biosimilar to” an already licensed biologic, or reference product. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively, by relying to some extent on the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference biologic to which the proposed product is biosimilar. 
Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted to the sponsor of the reference product. No biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until four years after the date of approval of the reference product, and no such application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after that same date. Once approved, biosimilar products likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be “interchangeable with”, the previously approved reference product.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the FDCA in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA.
11

The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care organizations and other entities. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if governmental healthcare programs and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our product, and patients may decline to purchase such products. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually establishes coverage and reimbursement policies, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement can be a time-consuming and costly process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval will be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results.
Additionally, we may develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates. We will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved. While we have not yet developed any companion diagnostic test for our product candidates, if we do, there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for the same reasons applicable to our product candidates.
Other Healthcare Laws
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and its various divisions, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. These regulations are enforced by various federal, state and local authorities, including but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, HHS’ various enforcement divisions, including but not limited to, the Office of Inspector General, the Office for Human Research Protections, or OHRP, and the Office of Research Integrity and other state and local government agencies. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
We are subject to complex laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other state and federal laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others on the other hand. 
12

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims statutes. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Private “qui tam” actions may be brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government to enforce the federal False Claims Act. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced investigations and private lawsuits and, in many cases, have agreed to significant and burdensome settlements under these laws for a variety of allegedly improper promotional and marketing activities, including inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and in some states, apply regardless of the payor. The federal False Statements Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track and annually report to CMS payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and to publicly report such data. 
Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and have privacy laws that may be more stringent that HIPAA. Further, some state laws require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, and certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
13

The Affordable Care Act
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries have been a particular focus of these efforts and have been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change health care delivery and financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries are the following:

• | The Affordable Care Act increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program from 15.1% to 23.1% and from 11% to 13% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs and biologic agents, respectively. The Affordable Care Act also added a rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products and potentially impacted manufacturers’ Medicaid Drug Rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.


• | On February 1, 2016, CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. 


• | Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. 


• | The Affordable Care Act imposes a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 70% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.


• | The Affordable Care Act imposes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. The Affordable Care Act expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and added new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance.


• | The Affordable Care Act established the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (as referenced above), which requires pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to track and report annually certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to such entities, and it requires applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and certain other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.


• | The Affordable Care Act added a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians.


• | The Affordable Care Act created a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.


• | A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.


• | The Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

14

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act and otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
Other Legislative Changes and Regulations
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
More recently, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the HHS OIG proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
