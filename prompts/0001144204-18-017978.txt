Overview
 
We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company developing a novel and proprietary class of biologic drugs for the selective modulation of the human immune system to treat a broad range of cancers and autoimmune disorders. We believe our innovative CUE Biologics™ platform approach to selectively modulate disease relevant T cells, provides a transformative solution to the challenges facing prevailing immunotherapeutics. By directly engaging and modulating disease relevant T cells in the patient’s body via an injectable drug, we believe our biologic drug candidates will be able to realize the true potential of immune modulation. Through our proprietary CUE Biologics™ platform, we believe we are uniquely positioned to become a prominent and leading player in immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, and autoimmune disease. While currently in preclinical development, our proprietary platform is intended to allow us to efficiently design and develop drug candidates that specifically and selectively engage disease relevant T cells for therapeutic affect, while minimizing or eliminating unwanted side effects. We have been aggressively seeking patent protection for our pioneering innovations and, combined with a license agreement with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (“Einstein”), continue to build a robust intellectual property portfolio. This portfolio includes our core technology platform for the engineering of biologics to selectively control T cell activity, which we call CUE Biologics™, a growing portfolio of precision immuno-modulatory drug candidates, and two supporting technologies we call MOD™ and viraTope™ that enable the discovery of costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) and T cell targeting peptides, respectively.
Background
 
The human immune system comprises a number of specialized cell types which collectively function to identify and defend the body against foreign threats. Central to the proper functioning of the immune system are the coordinated activities and communications between two specialized cell types, antigen-presenting cells (“APCs”) and T cells. APCs serve to capture and break the proteins from foreign organisms, (e.g., bacteria and viruses), or abnormal proteins (e.g., from genetic mutation in cancer cells) into smaller fragments suitable as signals for scrutiny by the larger immune system, including T cells. In particular, APCs break down proteins into small peptide fragments, which are then paired with a class of host molecules called the major histocompatibility complex (“MHC”) and displayed on the cell surface. Cell surface display of an MHC together with a peptide fragment, also known as a T cell epitope, provides the underlying scaffold surveilled by T cells, allowing for specific recognition. The peptide fragments can be pathogen-derived, tumor-derived, or derived from natural host proteins (self-proteins). Moreover, APCs can recognize certain pathogen associated molecules, such as bacterial toxins, viral proteins, viral nucleic acids, that communicate the pathogenic threat to the APC. The APCs relay this information to T cells through additional costimulatory signals in order to generate a more effective response.
 
T cells recognize peptide-MHC (“pMHC”) complexes through a specialized cell surface receptor, the T cell receptor (“TCR”). The TCR is unique to each T cell and, as a consequence, each T cell is highly specific for a particular pMHC target. In order to adequately address the universe of potential threats, a very large number (~10,000,000) of distinct T cells with distinct TCRs exist in the human body. Further, any given T cell, specific for a particular T cell peptide, is initially a very small fraction of the total T cell population. Although normally dormant and in limited numbers, T cells bearing specific TCRs can be readily activated and amplified by APCs to generate highly potent T cell responses that involve many millions of T cells. Such activated T cell responses are capable of attacking and clearing viral infections, bacterial infections, and other cellular threats including tumors, as illustrated below. Conversely, the broad, non-specific activation of overly active T cell responses against self or shared antigens can give rise to T cells inappropriately attacking and destroying healthy tissues or cells.

Activated T cells target tumor cells for killing through engagement of the TCR with its cognate pMHC.
 
TCR engagement by its specific or cognate pMHC delivers an activation signal to the T cell and defines the specificity of the response. However, robust and effective T cell activation requires that the TCR signal be accompanied by additional signals from the APC, collectively referred to as “costimulation.” The sum of these interactions directs the quality and magnitude of the T cell response. Specific costimulatory, as well as coinhibitory signals, may be delivered by the APC to the T cell through specific signaling molecules (ligands) interacting with their cognate receptors at the interface of these two cells, shown below. Based upon the particular nature of the pMHC and costimulatory signal(s), the T cell may differentiate into a variety of cell types, each with a specialized function (e.g., Tc1, Tc2, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tr1, etc.). Hence communication between APCs and T cells must be capable of precisely identifying threats and generating a response of appropriate quality and magnitude. An insufficient T cell response may result in a persistent pathogenic infection, or in the case of cancer, tumor persistence. Conversely, an excessive or inappropriate T cell response may damage the host acutely (e.g., acute viral hepatitis) or chronically through autoimmune disease (e.g., Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease, etc.).

Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells and is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Cancer cells arise when proteins responsible for regulating cell division, proliferation or death are altered and these changes can occur through several different mechanisms. Cancer cells may express particular proteins (antigens) at much higher levels than normal (collectively referred to as tumor associated antigens, e.g., PSA-1 and Wilms Tumor 1) or express oncogenic (tumor-causing) viral proteins that are responsible for transformation, producing so-called cancer “drivers”, such as HPV E7. Cells can also be rendered oncogenic by the damage of host proteins through mutation (e.g., p53 and KRAS), which result in the expression of cancer neoantigens. Regardless of the nature of oncogenesis, cancer cells can display on their cell surface antigenic peptides, which are often recognized by the immune system.
 
In addition to being transformed, cancer cells have the ability to evade or modulate immune surveillance. This “immune escape” can be a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. Cancer cells employ a variety of approaches to escape immune surveillance or to suppress the effects of an immune response. One example of this is observed when cancer cells evade a normal immune response by expressing cell surface molecules that interact with and inhibit the attacking immune cells. These inhibitory interactions, called “immune checkpoints,” provide the tumor with a shield or buffer from activated and tumor-specific T cells. Checkpoint pathway inhibitors are therapeutic antibodies in immuno-oncology that are designed to block the tumor’s inhibitory shield; they have demonstrated promising clinical results. Another mechanism by which tumors can turn down the immune response is by stimulating the production of CD4+ regulatory T cells (“Tregs”), which in turn inhibit the killer CD8+ T cells that would normally attack the cancer. Thus, through one or more of these different pathways, the cancer cells manipulate and bias the local tumor microenvironment in favor of immune cell suppression. To extend and enhance the observed clinical benefits of therapeutic checkpoint blockade, a concurrent means of specifically activating and expanding a tumor-specific CD8+ T cell population is desired. Of interest, recent results from cancer trials that focus on activating a general (non-specific) immune response have shown that globally stimulated immune cells can attack “self” tissue, thereby triggering a therapeutically-induced autoimmune disease, frequently observed in patients as a consequence of their treatment and can limit further therapy.
 
In autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, components of the immune system are unable to effectively distinguish between foreign and “self” tissues and so the immune system mounts a response that can result in extensive destruction of normal tissue. Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases often occur in genetically predisposed individuals and can be triggered by select conditions, such as infection or tissue damage. The result is an immune response against healthy tissue, amounting to the second highest cause of chronic illness in the United States and a leading cause of death for women under 65.
 
In order to eliminate tumor cells and infectious agents, the immune system needs to be amplified, whereas for the effective treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the immune response needs to be specifically suppressed. Certain T cell populations are known to be critical to the development and persistence of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In the case of autoimmune diabetes, for example, effector T cells can kill insulin-producing cells of the pancreas through direct and indirect mechanisms. Once most insulin-producing cells have been destroyed by the aberrant T cell response, the patient is no longer able to regulate blood glucose levels and develops diabetes. In addition to disease-causing effector T cells (Teff), there exist populations of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which act to inhibit such dangerous responses in normal individuals. Tregs are able to inhibit the destructive activity of Teff and are part of the immune system’s control apparatus.
 
We believe that our technology can be used to specifically treat autoimmune disease. We are working on two different approaches: (1) the direct inhibition and/or deletion of the pathogenic autoimmune effector T cells and (2) the control of the effector T cells’ function through the expansion and activation of Tregs.
 
Immunotherapy
 
During the last five years, there has been substantial scientific progress in therapeutically modifying the function of immune cells (“immunotherapies”), such as T cells, to either enhance tumor killing in the context of oncology, or protect tissue in the context of autoimmune disease. Immunotherapies are therefore increasingly recognized as an essential aspect of the emerging opportunities in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. Despite the tremendous promise of these therapies, there are a number of continuing challenges. For example, most of the currently used cancer immunotherapies rely on non-specific and general activation of T cells or the inhibition of costimulatory pathways (e.g., checkpoint pathway inhibitors), both of which result in the global, non-specific stimulation of T cells. The global and nonspecific engagement by many current immunotherapeutics results in the activation of a large fraction of disease-irrelevant T cells, rather than selective activation of those T cells which can therapeutically affect the disease by virtue of their antigen-specific TCRs. The net effect of this approach is typically an extremely narrow therapeutic window in which many of the stimulated T cells are not selective towards the tumor, and often recognize “self antigens”. This results in significant toxicity and serious side effects and, in severe cases (e.g., Proleukin™ and Yervoy™), fatalities. Similarly, for the treatment of autoimmune indications, previous immunotherapies have been non-specific and broadly suppress immune function (e.g., Humira™, cyclosporine and methotrexate) and thus potentially predispose patients to deadly infections, and cancer.

Checkpoint pathway inhibitors modulate the costimulatory pathways described and illustrated above by blocking the function of inhibitory receptors which would normally suppress the activation of T cells, so-called “immune checkpoints.” Checkpoint blockade is predominantly achieved through the use of monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) directed against the desired checkpoint protein (e.g., mAbs to PD1 or CTLA-4). These mAbs can block the checkpoint proteins such as programmed cell death-1 (e.g., PD-1, Pembrolizumab/ Keytruda (Merck)) and CTLA-4 (e.g., Yervoy/Ipilimumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb)), and hence reactivate the inhibited anti-cancer T cell responses and stimulate T cell proliferation. The checkpoint inhibitors currently on the market have demonstrated significant and durable responses in some patients. However, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is still limited by modest to low response rates. For example, 34% of advanced melanoma patients respond to anti-PD-1 and 12% of advanced melanoma patients respond to anti-CTLA-4. To enhance the proportion of responding patients, strategies, such as combinations with other existing cancer therapies, are currently being explored. While these strategies have promise, severe side effects including potentially life threatening immune-related adverse events can affect upwards of 24% of patients using anti-CTLA-4 therapy alone, or 54% when used in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy (e.g., Nivolumab).
 
An alternative approach to activate an immune response is through the use of bi-specific antibodies that concomitantly engage the TCR on a T cell and an antigen on the tumor cell, examples of which are BiTEs (e.g., Amgen) or Darts (e.g., Macrogenics). These bi-specific antibodies are distinct from the monoclonal antibodies described above in that they are engineered to simultaneously bind to two different types of antigen, rather than one. To activate the T cells, the bi-specific molecules are designed to engage a tumor antigen while also engaging a component of the T cell receptor, called CD3. Since CD3 is expressed on all T cells, dual engagement through bi-specific molecules results in a global, non-specific activation of T cells at the tumor or wherever the antigen is expressed. The non-specific activation of large T cell subsets can give rise to significant toxicity, thereby significantly limiting the acceptable dose and therapeutic range of this approach.
 
An additional approach to activating an antitumor immune response is cytokine immunotherapy. Cytokines, such as recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), can directly stimulate immune effector cells leading to antitumor efficacy, but the clinical benefit with systemic administration is limited by induction of Tregs and by severe toxicities. Recently, concepts for tumor-targeted delivery of IL-2 have shown promise. A Phase 1 trial data with an IL-2 molecule having multiple releasable polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, NKTR-214, is showing encouraging evidence of anti-tumor activity, and a favorable tolerability profile. The PEGylation leads to a slow release of active IL-2 and loss of IL-2 preferential binding to Tregs. The NKTR-214-induced immune cell changes promote immune cell tumor destruction, with increased numbers of proliferating CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the blood and tumor and accumulation of CD8+ T cells relative to T regulatory immune suppressive cells in tumors. A tumor-antigen-CEA-targeted IL-2 fusion protein also in phase I clinical testing, has been shown to increase natural killer and CD8+ T cells in tumors. These data support the concept of immune cell-specific IL-2 delivery, such as in CUE biologics that include IL-2 costimulatory molecules.
 
As described above, cancer cells can evade a normal immune response by expressing cell surface inhibitory molecules that interact with and suppress the attacking T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, more recent bi-specific approaches seek to decorate tumor cells with activating costimulatory signals to potentially overcome tumor resident immune cell suppression. This is achieved by targeting a tumor antigen with one arm and presenting a costimulatory signal for potential tumor resident T cell stimulation through the other. These bispecific molecules have been used in patients with, in some cases, good therapeutic results. However, there are significant limitations. For example, they must first localize to the tumor in order to exert their effects (e.g., those from Altor, Sutro, Covagen, Roche, and Amgen) and have the added limitation of engaging only the subset of T cells which successfully traffic to the tumor within the treatment window. Notably, CUE biologics are designed to engage T cells directly, not requiring tumor targeting, and thus allow for T cell priming and activation in the periphery (e.g., tumor draining lymph node) outside the suppressive tumor microenvironment. Lastly, the use of these tumor directed bi-specifics may be hampered by the drug’s short half life in patients, thus requiring continuous infusion.

A different approach that has shown some promise in tumor therapy is to remove T cells from patients, activate and stimulate them outside the body (ex vivo), which expands them (usually over 7-14 days), and then infuse them back into the patients. These methods are termed cellular therapies, and include adoptive cell therapy (“ACT”) and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (“CAR-T”) therapy (e.g., those from Juno and Kite). At the outset, this is an individualized patient-specific approach. In ACT, native (un-modified) T cells are extracted and purified from a patient, expanded ex vivo and re-introduced to the patient in order to increase the number of T cells available to kill the tumor cell. Similarly, in CAR-T therapy, patient T cells are extracted and purified; however, distinct from ACT, patient T cells are genetically modified to target tumor-specific antigens through the use of chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”) prior to patient infusion in an attempt to increase specificity. CARs are comprised of an external tumor-specific antibody fragment or engineered TCR (e.g., Adaptimmune) linked to cytoplasmic signaling domains for T cell activation such that upon binding of the tumor antigens, the engineered T cells proliferate and attack cancer cells.
 
CAR-T-based immunotherapy has demonstrated complete responses of greater than 80% in recent clinical trials of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) patients. However, potent CAR-T cell responses have produced life threatening cytokine release syndromes (“CRS”) in 69% of high burden ALL adults. Severe toxicities and deaths led to a halt in JCAR015, Juno’s lead CAR-T program, and potentially pose a safety challenge to the wider adoption of cellular therapies. Moreover, the technical requirements and expense associated with individualized T cell extraction, ex vivo amplification/modification, and patient re-infusion represent significant scaling and cost challenges that might limit broad usage and eventual commercialization of this therapeutic modality. Despite these safety and scalability considerations, the recent demonstration of impressive clinical survival in patients treated with cellular therapies deserves serious attention.
 
Our Approach for Next Generation Immunotherapies
 
We have developed a proprietary platform for the design and development of biologic drugs for in vivo (e.g., directly in the patient’s body) T cell based immunotherapy. In the context of cancer, CUE Biologics are being designed to selectively activate T cells which recognize cancer antigens (e.g., peptides) expressed or amplified in cancer cells (tumor antigens or neoantigens). For the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, arthritis and others, CUE Biologics are designed to selectively dampen disease-causing T cell responses directed against self-antigens.
 
CUE Biologics are designed to mimic the signals, or “cues”, of the immune system to generate highly focused T cell responses associated with disease. We accomplish this by the fusion of unique costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) with a TCR targeting p-MHC complex (“pMHC”). This co-engagement of signals through the TCR and costimulatory receptor mimic and recapitulate the very signals delivered by APCs to T cells during an immune response. In this way CUE Biologics™ allow for the precise targeting of distinct signaling ligands exclusive to the T cell population of interest, resulting in targeted T cell modulation. 
 

CUE BiologicsTM are designed to mimic Antigen Presenting Cells (“APCs”)
 
Our therapeutic approach is designed to be administered directly in patients (in vivo) which differs markedly from other T cell therapeutic approaches such as ACT, which requires patients’ T cells to be first harvested, then stimulated and expanded outside the body before being reinfused in an activated state. We believe CUE Biologics represent a breakthrough approach as a disease-specific biologic T cell modulator administered in vivo (in body) rather than the ex vivo (outside the body) approach deployed by current cellular immune therapies. Furthermore, we believe the desired pharmacological effect in patients will be more precisely controlled by directly administering CUE Biologics into the patient for selective modulation of disease relevant T cells.

The therapeutic properties and selective nature of Cue Biopharma’s drug candidates result from the design and optimization of key functional parameters for a given therapeutic framework. Each framework harbors an MHC and one or more costimulatory element(s) optimized to drive a particular type of T cell response, such as stimulation and expansion of a cytolytic T cell response to kill cancer cells, or specific down-regulation and inhibition in the context of autoimmune disease. The targeting of the framework to specific T cell populations is dependent on the specific peptide linked to the MHC. Notably, more than 75 peptides that are expressed by different solid tumors are currently described in the clinical literature. Thus, after finalizing a therapeutic framework (pMHC-ligand-Fc) we believe different tumors can be addressed by changing the targeting peptide, presenting the promise of greatly reducing the time and cost associated with the generation of new CUE molecules to take forward through IND-enabling studies and, potentially, into the clinic.

Using our CUE Biologics™ platform, we believe we will be able to design biologics that will have certain advantages over existing immunotherapies including increased specificity, reduced toxicity and greater manufacturability. As such, we believe our approach to designing and developing immuno-modulatory biologics represents a breakthrough, next-generation solution to realizing the promise of T cell based immunotherapies.
 
Competition
 
Immunotherapy technologies are advancing at a rapid pace and we anticipate competing with companies developing bi-specific antibodies (e.g., Amgen, Inc., Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche), Sutro Biopharma), CAR-T therapies (e.g., Novartis A.G., Juno Therapeutics, Kite Pharma, Inc.), checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co. and Pfizer, Inc.), antibody drug conjugates (“ADCs”) (e.g., Seattle Genetics, Inc., ImmunoGen, Inc. and Sorrento Therapeutics), and targeted cytokines (Nektar/Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche) many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have.

CUE Biologics™ Drug Candidates
 
The relative effectiveness of immunotherapies depends on whether a relevant or optimal therapeutic mechanism to engage the immune system has been addressed by the therapy, and it is likely that different immune stimulatory mechanisms will be required to optimally address certain cancers over others. The versatility of the CUE Biologics™ platform allows access to multiple distinct mechanisms with a series of biologic frameworks addressing a variety of conditions and requirements. We have currently designed two promising therapeutic frameworks to support distinct and potent mechanisms of T cell activation: our pMHC/IL-2 based CUE-100 series (to enhance overall numbers of tumor specific T cells) and our pMHC/CD80:4-1BBL based CUE-200 series (to reinvigorate exhausted T cells). We expect to be able to target antigen-specific T cell populations in a variety of indications by a simple peptide exchange into validated CUE Biologics™ frameworks. We continue to evaluate additional constructs from which we will launch further framework series in both oncology and autoimmunity.
 


Illustration of CUE-100 and CUE-200 frameworks CUE-101
 
In furtherance of our efforts to design and test various frameworks addressing a variety of conditions, we are developing and implementing a complementary ex vivo (outside the body) human cancer model assay system for testing and evaluating CUE Biologics™ molecules directly in cancer patient-derived T cells. The ex vivo assays have the potential to provide a powerful tool for demonstrating human translatability by evaluating preclinical proof of mechanism and proof of concept directly in human samples, as well as for defining relevant metrics and critical parameters informing clinical application(s). Through this assay system, we have recently tested various epitopes (CMV and MelanA/MART, shown below) on the CUE-101 framework to support the versatility and robustness of our CUE Biologics™ platform.

As exemplary of our CUE Biologics™ platform, we have begun development work on our anticipated first clinical candidate, CUE-101 (described below) and are utilizing our ex vivo assay capabilities to generate data for proof of concept with potent, tumor antigen-selective T cell activation. The ex vivo assays, utilizing clinical samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (“PBMCs”) for testing and evaluating CUE-101, are expected to provide data to support an IND submission and to inform our phase I study protocol and clinical development strategy. Human PBMCs, including those from cancer patients, are the most relevant model for characterizing the activity and specificity of CUE-101. These studies, investigating the drug levels and duration of drug exposure, for functional and molecular changes (PD effects) in target immune cells and in non-target cells will guide human dosing and PD biomarker monitoring in our phase I trial. In addition to providing potentially insightful data relating to the prospects of antitumor efficacy in patients, the assays are designed to define the drug exposure range for antitumor activity as well as provide evidence for clinical biomarker selection and the biopsy schedule for clinical proof of mechanism.

CUE-101
 
Our current lead drug candidate, CUE-101, uses the pMHC/IL-2 CUE-100 framework, and is a fusion of a variant form of the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and a T cell antigen (pMHC). The targeting peptide contained in the pMHC that is currently used in CUE-101 is derived from the human papilloma virus E7 protein (HPV-E7). CUE-101 is a single, covalently-assembled biologic designed to target and activate T cells specific to HPV-related cancers. Treatments for patients with HPV-related cancers represent are an important unmet clinical need, which accounts for approximately 24,600 cases of cervical, head and neck, and genitoanal cancers in the United States every year leading to approximately 9,000 deaths annually. HPV-driven cancers lead to approximately 225,000 deaths worldwide each year. We believe our drug candidate CUE-101 has the potential to provide patients with a more effective and safer alternative in treating their HPV-driven cancers. It is our current intention to file an IND for CUE-101 in the first quarter of 2019, provided the pre-IND efficacy and safety data generated supports continued development.
 
Our preclinical data, including a mouse animal model of HPV+ cancer, have generated encouraging results with monotherapy treatment with a murine CUE biologic comprised of IL-2 costimulatory and pMHC-HPV peptide domains. Tumor growth inhibition was observed with treatment in the HPV+ TC-1-Luc tumor model. Studies of this agent in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in complete tumor regression in some animals. These results compare favorably to results achieved in the same preclinical study using IL-2 or anti-PD-1 therapy alone, where no regressions were observed. Notably, in the tumor-free mice from the treatment group “cured” by the murine CUE:IL-2 compound combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, immunologic memory was demonstrated whereby no tumor growth observed in animals following tumor cell injection.
 


Results from CUE-101 human ex vivo study demonstrating peptide selectivity in target T cell binding and engagement by comparing binding of CUE-101 versus CUE-100 (CMV) to disease specific HPV E711-20 CD8 human T cells.
 
We have profiled CUE-101 activity in tumor antigen-specific T cells and PBMCs isolated from a healthy HPV+ human donor. These data demonstrate highly targeted engagement of CUE-101 specifically to tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells (shown above). These data further support that targeted engagement results in T cell receptor and IL-2 receptor activation as measured by increases in receptor signaling molecules. Furthermore, CUE-101 induces antigen specific T cell activation- and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)- cell surface marker changes and CTL-activity as measured by drug-induced production of IFNg, an established marker of T cell activation and killing potential (shown below). Lastly, CUE-101 has demonstrated expansion of antigen-specific T cells from donor PBMCs as a single agent. These results demonstrate antigen-specific T cell activation and expansion with CUE-101 in human immune cells. The timing and magnitude of changes with drug treatment will guide selection of the most relevant and robust markers and the timing for sampling in phase I patients treated with CUE-101.

Results from CUE-101 human ex vivo study indicating treatment with CUE-101 (HPV-E7) results in highly specific activation of antigen-specific T cells in a peptide and MOD (IL-2) dependent manner as measured by interferon gamma release,
 
While this preclinical data from ex vivo analysis of human T cells is highly encouraging, the data represent a single healthy HPV+ subject and may not be representative of results in samples from patients with HPV+ driven malignancies. As described below under “Business — Background,” cancer uses various mechanisms to suppress and alter the immune system. For example, it has been observed from clinical studies that some cancers, including HPV+ cancers, are capable of reducing and altering T cell populations. Therefore, we intend to further study CUE-101 in ex vivo assays with blood derived from multiple HPV+ cancer patients to demonstrate activation and proliferation of HPV-E7 specific T cells. We will also continue to survey other drug constructs targeting various cancer epitopes and plan to select promising candidates for clinical development. It is our current intention to file an IND for CUE-101 by the first quarter of 2019, provided the pre-IND efficacy and safety data generated supports continued development.
 


Results from CUE-101 human ex vivo study, indicating treatment with CUE-101 results in expansion of antigen-specific T cells as a single agent
 
While CUE-101 targets the HPV-E7 TCR in cervical/head and neck cancers, we believe our CUE Biologics™ platform may be used to target a large variety of alternative peptides which may allow us to address many tumors with high therapeutic need in the oncology patient population. In support of this, we have recently demonstrated highly potent efficacy in preclinical murine models targeting non-viral epitopes. These data together with the recent human ex vivo experiments using a melanoma specific epitope (MelanA/MART, shown above) in both healthy donor and melanoma patient samples support CUE-100 framework’s ability to activate distinct T cell populations via a simple amino acid peptide antigen exchange on an otherwise validated scaffold, which should reduce the time to clinic (and associated costs) of next-generation biologics. We are currently exploring multiple unique epitopes in the context of the CUE-100 series framework in human ex vivo assays to help guide prioritization of programs.

Extension to Autoimmune Indications
 
In addition to oncology, we are expanding our technology’s reach to generate highly promising and novel immunotherapeutics for the treatment of debilitating autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune indications may be addressed with our technology through two general strategies: (1) depleting disease causing autoreactive T cells by selectively delivering inhibitory signals or (2) by delivering signals to induce and expand regulatory T cells, which subsequently act to inhibit disease-causing T cells.
 
CUE Biologics™ frameworks for autoimmune disease will be designed to influence a subset of T cells known as CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells recognize peptides in the context of MHC class II proteins. Therefore, prototypic CUE Biologics™ frameworks in autoimmunity would rely on MHC class II recognition by CD4 T cells. This is distinct from the MHC class I recognition by CD8 T cells that is the basis of our current oncology pipeline. Both pathogenic (i.e., disease causing) and regulatory (disease limiting) CD4 T cell subsets are known to exist in autoimmune disease. Our CUE Biologics™ frameworks in autoimmunity will therefore be intended to treat autoimmune diseases by either depleting pathogenic CD4 T cells or amplifying regulatory CD4 T cell responses to specific disease relevant antigens. Potential autoimmune indications of interest include Type 1 diabetes, arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Graves’ disease), celiac disease and CNS/neurological autoimmune disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, etc.).
 
Consistent with our plan to establish strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology organizations to further our development efforts, in November 2017 we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) for a partnership to research and develop certain of our proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune diseases. We view this Collaboration Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. For further information, see below “Business — Our Collaboration Agreement with Merck”.


MOD™ and viraTope™ Technology Platforms
 
Supporting our CUE Biologics™ platform are two companion discovery platforms: MOD™, a costimulatory optimization and discovery platform, and viraTope™, a T cell epitope discovery platform, both illustrated below.

The design of CUE Biologics™ allows for incorporation of antigens and costimulatory molecules discovered through the MODTM platform to develop novel biologics to address new indications in oncology and autoimmune disorders.
 
We believe that the MOD™ technology platform has a unique ability to optimize existing costimulatory ligands for use in our biologics as well as discover as yet unknown costimulatory signaling molecules. The MOD™ platform represents a high throughput method for determining specific cell surface protein-protein interactions (e.g., signaling receptor:ligand pair(s)). In brief, MOD™ allows for the detection of associations between distinct cell surface query proteins (i.e., ligands) and cell surface expression libraries (i.e., receptors) to first identify molecular engagements and further allows for the mechanistic dissection of complex biochemical function by screening large numbers of mutant molecules. Taken together, we believe that MOD™ can provide powerful tools to first define novel protein-protein interactions associated with T cell activation. Secondly, MOD™ is designed to allow us to modulate these signaling ligands through the rapid screening of mutants in order to dissect biochemical function and alter binding properties (i.e., altered affinities and specificities). A key component of our therapeutic design involves decreasing the binding of the costimulatory element while retaining its biological activity (i.e., affinity attenuation). Affinity attenuation allows the pMHC to drive the engagement with the target T cells and limits off-target engagement and associated collateral toxicity.
 
The viraTope™ platform addresses the historic difficulty of identifying disease associated T cell signatures through the monitoring of complex T cell repertoires. As discussed previously, at the core of the molecular events comprising a T cell-mediated immune response is the engagement of the T cell receptor (“TCR”) with a small peptide antigen presented by an MHC molecule, referred to as a T cell epitope. This represents the immune system’s targeting mechanism and is a requisite molecular interaction for T cell activation and function, and forms the basis of our targeted immunotherapeutics (i.e., TCR targeting). The viraTope platform is designed to achieve rapid, comprehensive, and quantitative immunomonitoring by interrogating primary T cells with a combinatorial library of pMHC in conjunction with deep sequencing. viraTope’s™ libraries would query T cells with all possible mimotopes, leaving cognate pMHC bound to their respective T cells. Deep sequencing of the bound pMHC would comprehensively enumerate all T cell epitopes recognized by a given T cell sample. In this way, viraTope™ could allow the identification of novel epitopes differentially represented in diseased versus control patients and would further make the frequencies of all known and unknown T cell specificities accessible for prospective, in-study, and retrospective analyses of clinical trials. Thus, the ability to systematically identify the entire ensemble of epitopes for a given disease state represents a unique opportunity for the development of diagnostics and highly targeted therapeutics against infectious diseases, autoimmunity and cancers. We believe that viraTope™ has the ability to comprehensively and quantitatively monitor T cell responses, which could lead to the discovery of novel drug candidates and biomarkers for internal use or to potentially license to strategic partners.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our primary objective is to become a leading, next-generation immunotherapeutics/biopharmaceutical company developing highly highly selective biologics for precision immune modulation. We plan to do this through coordinated and integrated strategic initiatives. Key elements of our strategy include:

· | Modular and versatile platform allowing for efficient and rapid drug design, prototyping and optimization. We plan to leverage our CUE Biologics™ platform’s modular capabilities to rapidly and efficiently develop our drug candidates. We believe our platform will provide a highly productive portfolio of promising clinical drug candidates aimed at specifically targeting disease relevant T cells for effective immune modulation. The modular design of our CUE Biologics™ platform provides the flexibility and versatility to construct drug frameworks comprised of various MOD combinations to elicit novel mechanisms of action. As described above under “Our Approach to Next Generation Immunotherapies,” after we establish a successful framework that uses a specific peptide to target a particular disease indication, we expect to be able to use that framework to target additional disease indications by changing the targeting peptide. Therefore, by leveraging the previous work done to establish a framework, we believe we will be able to significantly compress the timeline (by as much as six to twelve months) and capital requirements associated with the development of additional drug candidates.

· | Using preclinical data and efficient Phase I clinical study design to accelerate the development process. We recently demonstrated through ex vivo assays using human clinical samples that CUE:IL-2 activates T cells in an antigen specific manner. We plan to continue testing our biologic drug constructs in ex vivo studies with human clinical samples using various cancer relevant epitopes to demonstrate selective activation of T cells specific for various antigens spanning a range of oncology indications. We believe this approach provides meaningful validating data enhancing the quality of our preclinical data package for IND filing. This data also has the potential of increasing the probability for identifying relevant pharmacodynamic (“PD”) biomarkers for patient monitoring and as a potential surrogate marker of anti-tumor activity in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we believe these ex vivo studies will supplement and potentially reduce our reliance on preclinical animal models, providing a more cost and time efficient means of testing our drug candidates’ activities. Given the urgent medical needs we intend to address with our drug candidates, we are planning to design and conduct our Phase I clinical studies to generate safety data and a clinically meaningful data package around efficacy with the aim of approaching the FDA for an accelerated registration study.

· | Using our process development and protein biochemistry capabilities as a competitive advantage. We anticipate devoting significant resources to optimizing drug design and process development, including protein engineering and optimization, which are key components to maximizing the value of our current and future drug candidates. Through our core competencies and proprietary CUE Biologics™, MOD™ and viraTope™ technology platforms, we are designing and developing a growing intellectual property portfolio of novel and proprietary immune modulatory biologics. We believe our modular approach to designing biologics, coupled with the protein engineering and optimization capabilities offered by our platform technologies, should enable us to more rapidly and cost-effectively design and optimize potential drug candidates, as compared to more traditional preclinical development processes. Although we have yet to advance any of our drug candidates into the clinic, we believe this efficient preclinical development process positions us well to potentially establish a leading position in the discovery and development of promising next generation immunotherapies.

· | Establishing key strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies. We believe that our CUE Biologics™ platform offers the promise of enabling us to develop multiple drug candidates that address a variety of potential indications within oncology, autoimmune disease and infectious disease. Accordingly, as we continue to evolve and progress our drug candidates through preclinical and early clinical development, we plan to establish strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology organizations, such as our partnership with Merck pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement described below. We believe that this will allow us to further enhance our capabilities and capacities to discover and develop multiple, promising drug candidates for unmet medical needs in oncology and autoimmunity in a highly productive and cost-effective manner.

· | Leveraging our relationships with Einstein, our scientific founders and other scientific advisors. Our scientific founders and Einstein, as well as our renowned scientific and clinical advisors (“SAB/CABs”), have a history of seminal, pioneering discoveries and possess significant experience in oncology, immunotherapy, immunology, and biophysics, as well as clinical development. We plan to leverage our scientific founders’ and SAB/CABs’ scientific and clinical expertise and guidance as we develop our product pipeline and technologies.

Our License Agreement with Einstein
 
Our CUE Biologics™, viraTope™ and MOD™ platforms have all been developed from technology covered by core patent applications licensed to us from Albert Einstein College of Medicine (“Einstein”) pursuant to a license agreement originally entered into on January 14, 2015 and amended and restated on July 31, 2017 (the “Einstein License”). The Einstein License covers certain patent rights relating to: (i) methods for high throughput receptor-ligand identification, which we refer to as our MOD™ platform or technology, (ii) a cellular platform for rapid and comprehensive T cell immunomonitoring, which we refer to as our viraTope™ platform or technology, (iii) CUE Fc fusion constructs and uses thereof, which we refer to as our CUE Biologics™ platform or technology, and (iv) variant PD-L1 polypeptides, T cell modulatory multimeric polypeptides and methods and uses thereof (collectively, the “Patents”). We hold a worldwide exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, import, make, have made, use, provide, offer to sell, and sell all products, processes and services that use the Patents, including certain technology received from Einstein relating thereto (“Licensed Products”).
 
The Einstein License is a royalty-bearing license obligating us to pay a percentage of proceeds received from sales of categories of Licensed Products at low single digit rates. We have also agreed to share a portion of our proceeds that we derive from other agreements, like sublicense agreements, relating to Licensed Products that we may enter into. The percentage of such proceeds that we are required to pay Einstein ranges from the low to high teens, depending on how far we have developed a Licensed Product before we enter into an agreement relating to the Licensed Product. These percentages are reduced for sales of Licensed Products in countries where a competing product exists and for products or services involving the use or incorporation of technology received from Einstein relating to synapse for targeted T cell activation molecules, receptor ligand identification or platforms for T cell monitoring. In addition to our obligation to pay royalties based upon a percentage of proceeds from sales of Licensed Products, we have also agreed to pay Einstein annual maintenance fees. The maintenance payments are creditable against any royalty payments we pay under the Einstein License. As of December 31, 2017, we had paid to Einstein an aggregate amount of $125,000 in license signing and license maintenance fees under the Einstein License.
 
Under the Einstein License, we are also obligated to make milestone payments corresponding to: (i) approval of the first IND by the FDA or foreign equivalent for a Licensed Product; (ii) approval of any subsequent IND application or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (iii) initiation of Phase II clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (iv) initiation of Phase II clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (v) initiation of Phase III clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (vi) initiation of Phase III clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product, (vii) the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product; (viii) the first commercial sale of each “new indication” for one of our previously approved Licensed Products; and (ix) cumulative sales of certain Licensed Products reaching certain threshold amounts. The aggregate amount of milestone payments made under the Einstein License may equal up to $1.85 million for each Licensed Product and up to $1.85 million for each new indication of a Licensed Product. Additionally, the aggregate amount of one-time milestone payments based on cumulative sales of all Licensed Products may equal up to $5.75 million.
 
In addition to our obligations to make the cash payments to Einstein described above, under the Einstein License we were required to issue Einstein 671,572 shares of our Common Stock immediately prior to completion of the intial public offering of our common stock completed on December 27, 2017.
 
The Einstein License commenced on January 14, 2015 and expires upon the expiration of our last obligation to make royalty payments to Einstein, unless terminated earlier under the provisions thereof. Under the Einstein License, we will be obligated to make royalty payments to Einstein, with respect to certain Licensed Products, for the longer of 15 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for the duration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory agency for such product and, with respect to certain Licensed Products sold by sublicensees, the longer of 10 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for so long as the sublicensee agrees to pay royalties on such products. We have the right to terminate the Einstein License at any time upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to Einstein; provided, however, that we will lose intellectual property rights related to the Patents if we choose to terminate the Einstein License in this manner. Each party has the right to terminate the Einstein License if the other party is in default or breach of any condition of the Einstein License with a right to cure any such breach within sixty (60) days from receipt of notice of such default or breach, unless the other party has disputed the alleged breach in good faith. Either party can also terminate the Einstein License if the other party voluntarily files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition that is not dismissed within ninety (90) days. If we fail to pay any sum that is due and payable to Einstein within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of our default from Einstein, then Einstein has the option of terminating the Einstein License unless we pay within forty-five (45) days of such notice all delinquent sums with interest. Einstein may also terminate the Einstein License in the event we are convicted of certain felonies relating to the manufacture or use of Licensed Products.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | spend a minimum amount per year on product development until our first commercial sale of a Licensed Product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we fail to meet any of the Diligence Milestones, Einstein will have the right to terminate the Einstein License if such Diligence Milestone is not satisfied within thirty (30) days from receiving a written notice of default from Einstein. Under certain circumstances and upon prior notice to Einstein, we may have the right to an additional extension of our Diligence Milestones if, despite our commercially reasonable efforts we are not able to satisfy the Phase II clinical trial Diligence Milestone or any subsequent Diligence Milestone. As of the date of this prospectus, we have met all required Diligence Milestones.
 
Our Collaboration Agreement with Merck
 
On November 14, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) for a partnership to research and develop certain of our proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune disease indications (the “Initial Indications”). We view this Collaboration Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. The research program outlined in the Collaboration Agreement entails (1) our research, discovery and development of certain CUE Biologics™ drug candidates up to the point of demonstration of certain biologically relevant effects (“Proof of Mechanism”) and (2) the further development by Merck of the CUE Biologics™ drug candidates that have demonstrated Proof of Mechanism (the “Proposed Product Candidates”) up to the point of demonstration of all or substantially all of the properties outlined in such Proposed Product Candidates’ profiles as described in the Collaboration Agreement.
 
For the purposes of this collaboration, we have granted to Merck under the Collaboration Agreement an exclusive license under certain of our patent rights, including a sublicense of patent rights licensed from Einstein, to the extent applicable to the specific CUE Biologics™ that are elected to be developed by Merck. From the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement until the earlier of (i) the first achievement of Proof of Mechanism for a Cue Biologic™ drug candidate or (ii) 18 months after we notify the joint steering committee that the first Product Candidate has been synthesized under the research program, we are required to forebear from researching, developing or licensing to a third party rights related to any CUE Biologics™ drug candidate for the treatment of autoimmune diseases other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, so long as Merck continues product development on a Proposed Product Candidate, we are restricted from conducting any development activities within the Initial Indication covered by such Proposed Product Candidate other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement. The Company is not required to forbear at any time, however, from developing other Cue Biologics™ for use in therapeutic areas other than autoimmune diseases, e.g., for use in treating cancer or infectious diseases.

In exchange for the licenses and other rights granted to Merck under the Collaboration Agreement, we received a $2.5 million nonrefundable up-front payment and may be eligible to receive additional funding in developmental milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties if all research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones agreed upon by both parties are successfully achieved. Excluding the upfront payment described above, we are eligible to earn up to $101 million for the achievement of certain research and development milestones, $120 million for the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and $150 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestones, in addition to tiered royalties on sales, if all pre-specified milestones associated with multiple products across the primary disease indication areas are achieved. The Collaboration Agreement requires us to use the first $2.7 million of milestone payments we receive under the agreement to fund contract research. The amount of the royalty payments is a percentage of product sales ranging in the single digits based on the amount of such sales.
 
The term of the Collaboration Agreement extends until the expiration of all royalty obligations following a product candidate’s receipt of marketing authorization, at which point Merck’s licenses and sublicenses granted under the agreement shall become fully paid-up, perpetual licenses and sublicenses, as applicable. Royalties on each product subject to the Collaboration Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the later of: (1) the last-to-expire patent claiming the compound on which such product is based and (2) a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merck may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time upon 30 days’ notice to the Company. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach of its obligations thereunder and fails to cure such breach within 90 days after notice or by either party if the other party files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our current patent applications and any future patents and other proprietary rights that we own, or control through licensing, are and will be essential to our business. We believe that these intellectual property rights will affect our ability to compete effectively with others. We also rely and will rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for our/their intellectual property, including those patent applications to which we have secured exclusive rights.
 
We own or have licensed 14 pending patent applications in the United States (including 11 pending U.S. provisional patent applications), four pending international PCT applications and 34 pending foreign patent applications intended to protect the intellectual property underlying our technology. Our patent applications describe certain features of our technologies, including our CUE Biologics™ platform and drug candidates, viraTope™, MOD™ screening, MOD™ variants and combinations of MODs. We plan to spend considerable resources and focus in the future on obtaining U.S. and foreign patents. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property. No assurances can be given that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We intend to expand our international operations in the future and our patent portfolio, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 
Each of our patents, if and when granted, will generally have a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date, subject to available extensions. They are thus set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2032 to 2037, although there can be no assurance that any of the patent application will be granted.

Target Markets
 
Our initial focus and objective is to develop drug candidates for cervical/head and neck cancers, hepatocellular carcinomas, and melanoma. We expect that our future developmental roadmap will also focus on new drug candidates that target autoimmune disorders. We currently do not have any products that are developed such that they can be tested for clinical trials or commercial use. According to published reports, in 2016 oncology drugs were an $87.5 billion global market and autoimmune drugs constituted a $47.8 billion global market.
Our Commercialization Strategy
 
We are a preclinical stage company without a history of revenue or manufacturing, late stage clinical development or marketing experience. Because late stage clinical development, as well as establishing a full manufacturing and distribution structure, is expensive and time consuming, we intend to explore alternative commercialization strategies, including:

· | developing drug candidates through the earlier stages of clinical development with the objectives of rapid, cost effective risk reduction and value creation and then establishing strategic partnership for late stage clinical development and subsequent commercialization;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | developing a robust pipeline of promising drug candidates at various stages of the development process to establish optionality and regular value inflection opportunities and revenue(s);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strategically entering into co-development partnership(s) to retain potential for commercialization rights on selected drug candidate(s) and market opportunities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | partnering with industry participants to incorporate our technology into new and existing drugs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect that partnering with pharmaceutical or biotherapeutic companies may accelerate product acceptance into our target market areas and gain the sales and marketing advantages of the partner’s distribution infrastructure. We intend to continue to strengthen our market position and solidify our leadership position in immunotherapy by continuing to improve our technology, broadening our clinical and therapeutic applications, identifying new clinical and therapeutic applications and forming strategic partnerships.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Therapeutic products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals or clearances, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, denial of export applications, governmental prohibitions on entering into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, as well as any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with therapeutic approval, we will have to comply with the many requirements associated with preclinical and clinical trials, the FDA application process, the terms of any pre-certification protocols and agreements, FDA manufacturing requirements for prototypes, and testing. Upon approval of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) and similar approvals in other jurisdictions, there will be additional regulation relating to the packaging, distribution, marking, marketing and claims of our potential products. These later regulations are not only found in federal regulation but many states and, of course, foreign countries.
The FDA Process
 
The FDA regulates the clinical testing and design of therapeutics to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended uses. The application process for a new therapeutic is highly regulated.
 
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our potential products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our potential products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current good manufacturing procedures (“cGMP”) established by the FDA for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization.

Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local levels) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in a foreign country. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
U.S. Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the Public Health Services Act (the “PHSA”) and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with commercial development of T cell therapies for cancer. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (an “IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Marketing Practices (“cGMP”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTPs”) for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

Before testing any biological drug candidate, including our drug candidates, in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (an “IRB”) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (an “IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into human subjects to test for safety (adverse effects), determine recommended Phase 2 dosing and evaluate any signals of efficacy for specific targeted diseases. The initial human testing is often conducted in patients, rather than in healthy volunteers, in the case of products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is inherently toxic.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify safety risks, optimize dosing and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, as well as any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (the “PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the cGTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cellular tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing products, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, products that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of products to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is available for products that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features along with more intensive FDA guidance and interaction and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to give products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to expedite review of the application. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of products to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the product in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether the drug or biologic is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our potential products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our product candidate or if our product candidate’s indication is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product orphan indication. In addition, the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusivity if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the product is clinically superior to a previously approved product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan condition, regardless of whether or not the approved product was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any potential products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, it is FDA’s position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the quality and long-term stability of the product. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our potential products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our potential products under development.
 
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the “BPCIA”) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct pediatric clinical investigations of the product.
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patent applications, if granted, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 28 full-time employees and two part-time employees. Substantially all of our employees are in Cambridge, Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and other third parties to assist with various aspects of our drug and product development.
