ITEM 1.BUSINESS.
Overview
Applied DNA Sciences is a biotechnology company developing and commercializing technologies to produce and detect deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”). Using the polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) to enable both the production and detection of DNA, we operate in three primary business segments: (i) the manufacture of synthetic DNA for use in nucleic acid-based therapeutics (“Therapeutic DNA Production Services”); (ii) the detection of DNA in molecular diagnostics (“MDx”) testing services (“MDx Testing Services”); and (iii) the manufacture and detection of DNA for industrial supply chain security services (“DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services”).
Our growth strategy is to primarily focus our resources on the further development, commercialization, and customer adoption of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services, including the expansion of our contract development and manufacturing operation (“CDMO”) for the manufacture of DNA for use in nucleic acid-based therapies and the development of our own product candidates in veterinary health.
Corporate History
We are a Delaware corporation, which was initially formed in 1983 under the laws of the State of Florida as Datalink Systems, Inc. In 1998, we reincorporated in the State of Nevada, and in 2002, we changed our name to our current name, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. On December 17, 2008, we reincorporated from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware.
Our corporate headquarters are located at the Long Island High Technology Incubator at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, where we have established laboratories for the manufacture and detection of DNA to support our various business units. In addition, this location also houses our New York State Department of Health (“NYSDOH”) Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (“CLEP”)-permitted, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”)-certified clinical laboratory where we perform MDx testing. The mailing address of our corporate headquarters is 50 Health Sciences Drive, Stony Brook, New York 11790, and our telephone number is (631) 240-8800.
Industry Background and Markets
Therapeutic DNA Production Services
Through our LinearRx, Inc. (“LRx”) subsidiary we are developing and commercializing the LinearDNA (“linearDNA”) platform. The linearDNA platform enables the rapid, efficient, and large-scale cell-free manufacture of high-fidelity synthetic DNA sequences for use in nucleic acid-based therapeutics. The linearDNA platform enzymatically produces a linear form of DNA we call ‘linearDNA’ that is an alternative to plasmid-based DNA manufacturing technologies that have supplied the DNA used in biotherapeutics for the past 40 years.
The DNA manufactured via our linearDNA platform may be used by a customer directly as a drug or biological product or it may be incorporated by a customer into a drug or biological product. To date, none of our linearDNA has been incorporated into a drug or biological product approved by any regulatory body. We do not know if our linearDNA will be incorporated into a drug or biological product that will be approved by any regulatory body but believe it has this potential as described herein.

We believe our enzymatic linearDNA platform has numerous advantages over existing cell-based plasmid DNA manufacturing platforms. Plasmid-based DNA manufacturing is based on the complex, costly and time-consuming biological process of amplifying DNA in living cells. Once amplified, the DNA must be separated from the living cells and other process contaminants via multiple rounds of purification, adding further complexity and costs. Unlike plasmid-based DNA manufacturing, the linearDNA platform does not require living cells and instead amplifies DNA via the enzymatic process of PCR. The linearDNA platform is simple, with only four ingredient inputs, and can rapidly produce very large quantities of DNA without the need for complex purification steps.
We believe the key advantages of the linearDNA platform include:

● | Speed – Production of linearDNA can be measured in terms of hours, not days and weeks as is the case with plasmid-based DNA manufacturing platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability – linearDNA production takes place on efficient bench-top instruments, allowing for rapid scalability in a minimal footprint.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Purity – DNA produced via PCR is pure, resulting in only large quantities of only the target DNA sequence. Unwanted DNA sequences such as plasmid backbone and antibiotic resistance genes, inherent to plasmid DNA, are not present in linearDNA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Simplicity – The production of linearDNA is streamlined relative to plasmid-based DNA production. linearDNA requires only four primary ingredients, does not require living cells or complex fermentation systems and does not require multiple rounds of purification.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flexibility – DNA produced via the linearDNA platform can be easily chemically modified to suit specific customer applications. In addition, the linearDNA platform can produce a wide range of complex DNA sequences that are difficult to produce via plasmid-based DNA production platforms. These complex sequences include inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and polyadenylation sequences (poly (A) tail) important to gene therapy and mRNA therapies, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical studies have shown that linearDNA is substitutable for plasmid DNA in numerous nucleic acid-based therapies, including:

● | therapeutic and prophylactic DNA vaccines;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | DNA templates for in vitro transcription to produce ribonucleic acid (“RNA”), including messenger RNA (“mRNA”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adoptive cell therapy manufacturing.
--+-------------------------------------

Further, we believe that linearDNA is also substitutable for plasmid DNA in the following nucleic acid-based therapies:

● | viral vector manufacturing for in vivo and ex vivo gene editing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (“CRISPR”)-mediated homology-directed repair (“HDR”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | non-viral gene therapy.
--+------------------------

As of the third quarter of calendar 2022, there were 3,694 gene, cell and RNA therapies in development from preclinical through pre-registration stages, almost all of which use DNA in their manufacturing process. (Source: ASGCT Gene, Cell & RNA Therapy Landscape: Q3 2022 Quarterly Report). Due to what we believe are the linearDNA platform’s numerous advantages over legacy plasmid-based DNA manufacturing platforms, we believe this large number of therapies under development represents a substantial market opportunity for linearDNA to supplant plasmid DNA in the manufacture of nucleic acid-based therapies.

Our linearDNA is currently manufactured pursuant to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) that we believe are sufficient for pre-clinical discovery and development of nucleic acid-based therapies. In addition, for indirect clinical use of linearDNA (i.e., where linearDNA is a starting material but is not incorporated into the final therapeutic product, as is the case with the production of mRNA or certain viral vectors), we believe that high-quality grade GLP linearDNA is sufficient for clinical and commercial stage customers of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services. For the direct clinical use of our linearDNA (i.e., nucleic acid-based therapies where our linearDNA is incorporated into the final therapeutic product, as in the production of DNA vaccines, adoptive cell therapies and certain gene therapies) we believe clinical and commercial-stage customers of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services will generally require our manufacturing facilities to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”). We currently do not have any manufacturing facilities that meet cGMP. We will need to develop and maintain manufacturing facilities that meet cGMP to support customers that wish to use our linearDNA for direct clinical use and for indirect clinical use customers who request linearDNA manufactured under cGMP. In the longer term, we believe that the development and maintenance of a cGMP manufacturing facility for linearDNA will benefit the entirety of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services business, in both direct and indirect clinical applications. We are in the design phase for a cGMP manufacturing facility, with expected cGMP manufacturing to begin in the second half of calendar 2023.
Our business strategy for the linearDNA platform is: (i) to utilize our current GLP LinearDNA production capacity to secure CDMO contracts to supply linearDNA to pre-clinical therapy developers, as well as clinical and commercial therapy developers and manufacturers that are pursuing therapeutics that require the indirect clinical use of linearDNA; and (ii) upon our development of cGMP linearDNA production facilities, to secure CDMO contracts with clinical stage therapy developers and commercial manufactures to supply linearDNA for direct clinical use.
In addition, we plan to leverage our Therapeutic DNA Production Services and deep knowledge of PCR to develop and monetize, ourselves or with strategic partners, one or more linearDNA-based therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines for the veterinary health market. Currently, we have in-licensed a therapeutic DNA vaccine candidate against canine lymphoma, which accounts for up to 24% of all cancers in canines. Our lymphoma vaccine candidate was licensed from Takis S.R.L and EvviVax, S.R.L. for exclusive use by the Company in association with our linearDNA platform, and is subject to certain commercialization milestones. We currently seek to commercialize our canine lymphoma vaccine in conjunction with lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation to facilitate intramuscular (“IM”) administration. We have recently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (mice studies) expression of generic reporter proteins via linearDNA encapsulated by LNPs. For the in vivo study, successful expression of the LNP-encapsulated linearDNA was administered and achieved via IM injection. We believe the linearDNA platform provides a substantial advantage to the development and monetization of a therapeutic DNA vaccine against canine lymphoma.
MDx Testing Services
Through Applied DNA Clinical Labs, LLC (“ADCL”), our clinical laboratory subsidiary, we leverage our expertise in DNA detection via PCR to provide and develop clinical MDx testing services. ADCL is a NYSDOH and CLEP permitted, CLIA-certified laboratory which is currently permitted for virology. In providing MDx testing services, ADCL employs its own or third-party molecular diagnostic tests.
Under our MDx testing services, ADCL currently provides COVID-19 testing for large populations marketed under our safeCircleTM trademark. Leveraging ADCL’s customizable high-throughput robotic pooled testing workflow and the CLEARED4 digital health platform owned and operated by CLEARED4 Inc. (the “CLEARED4 Platform”), our safeCircle testing service is an adaptable turnkey large population COVID-19 testing solution that provides for all aspects of COVID-19 testing, including test scheduling, sample collection and automated results reporting. Our safeCircle testing service utilizes high-sensitivity robotically-pooled real-time PCR (“RT-PCR”) testing to help mitigate virus spread by quickly identifying COVID-19 infections within a community, school, or workplace. Our safeCircle COVID-19 testing is performed using either the Company’s internally developed Linea 2.0 RT-PCR Assay, a NYSDOH conditionally approved laboratory developed test (“LDT”) or third-party emergency use authorization (“EUA”)-authorized RT-PCR COVID-19 assays. Our safeCircle testing service also incorporates the CLEARED4 Platform to enable large-scale digital test scheduling, in-field sample collection and registration, and results reporting. By leveraging the combination of our robotically-pooled workflows and the CLEARED4 Platform, our safeCircle testing services typically return testing results within 24 to 48 hours. We currently provide safeCircle testing services to higher education institutions, private clients, and businesses located in New York State.

ADCL has also developed PCR-based MDx testing services for the Monkeypox virus, which are currently approved by NYSDOH. These services are designed to run on the same high-throughput platform utilized by our COVID-19 testing services and provides ADCL’s with a substantial testing throughput. Demand for these types of services may vary greatly depending upon public health requirements, e.g., Monkeypox testing is now a lower public health priority, and we intend to pursue such opportunities on an opportunistic basis.
In addition to our infectious disease testing services, we are currently validating pharmacogenetics (“PGx”) testing services. Our PGx testing services will initially utilize a 120-target PGx panel test to evaluate the unique genotype of a specific patient to help guide individual drug therapy decisions. Our PGx testing services are designed to interrogate DNA targets on over 35 genes and provide genotyping information relevant to certain cardiac, mental health and pain management drug therapies. In addition, PGx testing services have been shown to significantly reduce healthcare costs both for individual patients as well as payors. We believe the economics of complex MDx testing services such as PGx are more favorable to the Company as compared to high-volume, low-complexity MDx tests such as COVID-19 testing. Our PGx testing services will require NYSDOH approval prior to initiating our patient testing services. If approved, we plan to commercialize our PGx testing services by offering PGx testing services to other clinical laboratories, large healthcare systems and self-insured entities. We have completed analytical validation of our PGx testing services and are currently undertaking clinical validation studies that are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2022.
Going forward, our business strategy for ADCL is to leverage our deep knowledge of PCR to develop and commercialize high complexity, high value and differentiated MDx testing services that will be offered to other clinical laboratories and healthcare facilities as clinical reference laboratory testing services. We believe operating as a clinical reference laboratory has several advantages when compared to operating as a typical clinical non-reference laboratory, including:

● | the ability to leverage our deep expertise in PCR to develop and perform high-value esoteric MDx testing services not performed by conventional clinical non-reference laboratories;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced sample acquisition costs;
--+----------------------------------


● | reduced marketing costs; and
--+-----------------------------


● | a national customer base that may lead to a larger total addressable market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The clinical reference laboratory services market is forecasted to have incremental growth of $26.0B between 2020 and 2025 with a 6.71% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). We believe that the rapidly increasing number of specialized MDx tests for early disease detection, disease prognosis, disease risk, companion diagnostics and personalized medicine will drive an increase in the demand for highly specialized MDx clinical reference laboratory services.
DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services
By leveraging our expertise in both the manufacture and detection of DNA via PCR, our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services allow our customers to use non-biologic DNA tags manufactured on our linearDNA platform to mark objects in a unique manner and then identify these objects by detecting the absence or presence of the DNA tag. We believe our DNA tags are not economically feasible nor practical to replicate, and that our disruptive tracking platform offers broad commercial relevance across many industry verticals. The Company’s core DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services, which are marketed collectively as a platform under the trademark CertainT®, include:

● | SigNature® Molecular Tags, which are short non-biologic DNA taggants produced by the Company’s linearDNA platform, provide a methodology to authenticate goods within large and complex supply chains for materials such as cotton, leather, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and other products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SigNify® IF portable DNA readers and SigNify consumable reagent test kits provide definitive real-time authentication of the Company’s DNA tags in the field, providing a front-line solution for supply chain integrity backed with forensic-level molecular tag authentication. The Company’s software platform enables customers to track materials throughout a supply chain or product life.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | fiberTyping®, which uses PCR-based DNA detection to determine a cotton cultivar, and other product genotyping services that utilize PCR-based DNA detection to detect a product’s naturally occurring DNA sequences for the purposes of product provenance authentication and supply chain security.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services are fully developed, highly scalable, and currently used in several commercial applications. To date, our largest commercial application for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services is in the tracking and provenance authentication of cotton. Cotton home textile products utilizing our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services are available in national retail chains including Costco® and Bed Bath & Beyond®.
We believe that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”), signed into law on December 23, 2021, may be helpful to increase demand for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services. The UFLPA establishes a rebuttable presumption that any goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (“XUAR”) of the People’s Republic of China are not entitled to entry to the United States. The presumption applies unless the importer of record has complied with specified conditions and, by clear and convincing evidence, shown that the goods were not produced using forced labor. On June 17, 2022, an implementation strategy for the UFLPA was published that listed DNA tagging as evidence that importers may present to potentially prove that a good did not originate in XUAR or did not benefit from forced labor. Approximately 20% of the world’s cotton garments contain cotton that originated in the XUAR.
Our business plan is to leverage growing consumer and governmental awareness for product traceability and the newly enacted UFLPA to expand our existing partnerships and seek new partnerships for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services with a focus on cotton and synthetic fibers. We do not know when and whether our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services will have increased demand based on the UFLPA or any other track-and-trace-type requirements for any products.
Sales and Marketing
We have seven employees engaged in sales and marketing, of which four are directly involved with sales.
Research and Development
For all of our business segments, we believe that our continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to our future success.
In our Therapeutic DNA Production Services segment, our research and development efforts are focused on the development and optimization of our linearDNA platform and the development of linearDNA-based vaccines for the veterinary health market. linearDNA platform development and optimization is focused on increased DNA yields, purification workflows and enzyme system optimization. For our linearDNA-based vaccines, our research and development efforts are focused on the development of a cost-effective LNP formulation that can achieve therapeutic antigen expression via linearDNA to facilitate IM administration of linearDNA vaccines.
In our MDx Testing Services segment, our research and development efforts are primarily focused on the development and validation of our PGx testing services. Our PGx testing services will utilize a 120-target PGx panel test to evaluate the unique genotype of a specific patient to help guide individual drug therapy decisions. Our PGx testing services are designed to interrogate DNA targets on over 35 genes and provide genotyping information relevant to certain cardiac, mental health and pain management drug therapies.
Our research and development efforts for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment are primarily focused on incorporating DNA molecular tags into carriers such as textiles, thermoplastics and pharmaceuticals and then authenticating DNA obtained from those marked products both in our laboratories and in the field, with the use of portable infield DNA readers and proprietary reagents.
We incurred approximately $3.9 million and $4.2 million on research and development activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our sources of raw materials include synthesized sources of DNA which we are able to replicate to use in our product offerings and that are available from multiple sources. In addition, we utilize DNA polymerase (“DNAP”) in all of our PCR reactions to amplify DNA. DNAP is available from multiple sources. For our Therapeutic DNA Production Services, our services may be optimized for a specific DNAP. Unforeseen discontinuation or unavailability of a certain DNAP produced by a single provider could cause production delays as we modify our product specifications and workflows to accommodate a replacement DNAP.
Manufacturing
For our Therapeutic DNA Production Services and DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segments, we have the capability to manufacture large quantities of DNA via our linearDNA platform at our facility in Stony Brook. For our MDx Testing Services segment, we also manufacture COVID-19 diagnostic assay kits in our Stony Brook facility. We also have in-house capabilities to complete all authentications for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment in our Stony Brook location and textile authentications in our India location.

If a competitor develops superior technology or cost-effective alternatives to our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of and protection for our various technologies and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek and maintain patent protection in the United States and internationally for our various technologies associated with our three primary business markets. We endeavor to patent or in-license technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Because the development of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services and MDx Testing Services businesses are at an early stage, our intellectual property portfolio with respect to certain technologies associated with these businesses is also at an early stage. As further described below, we have filed or intend to file patent applications on certain technologies associated with these business markets, and as we continue the development of our technologies, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success.
We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. In our Therapeutic DNA Production Services, we currently rely heavily on trade secret protection. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our manufacturing processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products or services may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Approvals of Commercial Non-Biologic Products
We do not require any governmental approvals of our currently commercialized DNA Tagging and Security Product and Services.
Government Regulations for COVID-19 Testing
Surveillance testing is generally not regulated by the FDA and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has stated that CLIA certification is not required to conduct surveillance testing to report non patient-specific results. ADCL is offering its safeCircleTM surveillance testing in compliance with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), FDA, CMS and New York State Department of Health recommendations.
In addition, clinical diagnostic testing and the review and approval of LDTs in New York State falls under the jurisdiction of NYSDOH. ADCL is offering all clinical diagnostic testing and LDTs in compliance with NYSDOH regulations. For more information regarding the risks related to our COVID-19 testing services and our LDTs, see “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Customer and Collaborator’s Pharmaceutical and Biotherapeutic Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters”
Government Approvals of Drug and Biologic Products
The DNA manufactured via our linearDNA platform may be used by a customer directly as a drug or biological product or it may be incorporated by a customer into a drug or biological product. We do not plan to seek approval of a drug or licensure of a biological product based on our linearDNA platform, except with respect to the veterinary health market, but the demand for our linearDNA is in part dependent on our customer’s ability to seek and obtain approval of a drug or biological product using our technology.
Drug and biologic products which are subject to extensive regulation by FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign countries. Biologics include a wide range of products such as vaccines, gene therapy, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances. They may also be living entities such as cells or tissue. Some of our product candidates may be incorporated into drugs and biologics that are or will be subject to regulation as described in the next section. Some of our products may be drugs or biologics that are subjected themselves to regulation as described in the following section. In either case, we are unlikely to receive material revenues until the

related drug or biologic candidate receives regulatory approval. The FDA and other authorities regulate among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drug and biologic products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to file a marketing application, to issue a Complete Response letter or to not approve pending New Drug Applications (“NDA”) or Biologics Licensing Applications (“BLA”), or to issue warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, litigation, government investigation and criminal prosecution.
Drug and biologic products that must undergo preclinical and clinical evaluation relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutics products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our collaborators and customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance, safety, efficacy or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded.
Government Regulation of Pharmaceutical and Biologic Products
The DNA manufactured via our linearDNA platform may be used by a customer directly as a drug or biological product or it may be incorporated by a customer into a drug or biological product. We do not plan to seek approval of a drug or licensure of a biological product based on our linearDNA platform, except with respect to the veterinary health market, but the demand for our linearDNA is in part dependent on our customer’s ability to seek and obtain approval of a drug or biological product using our technology.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In addition, veterinary DNA vaccines and therapeutics in the United States are subject to review and regulatory approval by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal health vaccines, including certain immunotherapeutics. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are submitted in accordance with the agency requirements.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. In an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”) requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA. In addition, an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, 

14



including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the drug or biologic is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to ensure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application.
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs or biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
In addition, drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval of a drug or biologic is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Systems, or REMS, program.
In many foreign countries, drugs and biologics are subject to regulatory requirements in addition to and sometimes different than the U.S. requirements described herein.

Veterinary Biologics
The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologicals is the USDA. The Center for Veterinary Biologics within the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the USDA is responsible for the regulation of animal health biologicals, which includes but is not limited to vaccines, including DNA vaccines, bacterins, allergens, antibodies, antitoxins, toxoids, immunostimulants, certain cytokines, antigenic or immunizing components of live microorganisms, and diagnostic components of natural or synthetic origin, or that are derived from synthesizing or altering various substances or components of substances such as microorganisms, genes or genetic sequences, carbohydrates, proteins, antigens, allergens or antibodies. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, potent, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results must be maintained and submitted in accordance with USDA requirements.
Laboratory Developed Tests
The FDA is currently exercising enforcement discretion over the regulation of most Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”), such as our Linea 2.0 SARS-CoV-2 Assay and our Monkeypox Virus 1.0 Assay. If the FDA were to begin enforcement, our products would potentially be subject to extensive regulation as a medical device under federal law. In order to market a medical device, a company must first receive either FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, de novo authorization, or approval of a Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more rigorous, costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market, known as a “predicate” device, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The de novo process provides a marketing pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing, and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk. Following FDA clearance, authorization or approval, medical devices are subject to continuing regulatory requirements, including those related to manufacturing, labeling, advertising and promotion, restrictions on sale, distribution and use, and surveillance of safety issues and product complaints.
Most recently in Spring 2022, a version of a bill introduced in 2020 and 2021, the “Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2020,” or VALID Act, was added to the reauthorization bill for the Medical Device User Fee Act (“MDUFA”) V but then was removed to permit a more rapid passage of MDUFA V to prevent worker layoffs. The bill proposed a risk-based approach that would have subjected many LDTs to FDA regulation by creating a new in vitro clinical test, or IVCT, category of regulated products. As proposed, the bill would have grandfathered many existing LDTs from the proposed premarket approval, quality systems, and labeling requirements, respectively, but would require such tests to comply with other regulatory requirements (e.g., registration and listing, adverse event reporting). To market a high-risk IVCT, reasonable assurance of analytical and clinical validity for the intended use must be established. Under VALID, a precertification process would have been established that would have allowed a laboratory to establish that the facilities, methods, and controls used in the development of its IVCTs met quality system requirements. If pre-certified, low-risk IVCTs, developed by the laboratory would not have been subject to pre-market review. The new regulatory framework would have included quality control and post-market reporting requirements. The FDA would have had the authority to withdraw approvals for IVCTs for various reasons, including (for example) if there were a reasonable likelihood that the test would cause death or serious adverse health consequences. However, with bill language being removed from MDUFA V, we cannot predict if this (or any other bill) will be enacted in its current (or any other) form and cannot quantify the effect of such proposals on our business.

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) is a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA in order to perform testing on human specimens, unless they fall within an exception to CLIA certification, such as research laboratories that test human specimens but do not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of individual patients. CLIA certification is also required to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for diagnostic testing and services. In addition, proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of an accredited program under CLIA so that they can be offered in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Emergency Use Authorizations
The FDA has the authority to grant an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. When issuing an EUA, the FDA imposes conditions of authorization, with which the company must comply. Such conditions include, but may not be limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. The EUA is only effective for the duration of a pandemic-health-type situation, such as the current COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, we fail to comply with the terms of the EUA or our test is determined to be less accurate than it was initially believed to be. The FDA may revoke an EUA if there is a failure to comply with the conditions of authorization.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs for drugs and biologics. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect such operations include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS, payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17




● | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business.

Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval for drugs and biologics are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical and biologic products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Compliance with Environmental Law
We and any suppliers we currently or may in the future engage are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and do not have any material costs of compliance.
Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third party facilities. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, product development and manufacturing efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our preclinical trials, future clinical trials or regulatory approvals 

18



could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
Employees
As of September 30, 2022, we had a total of 69 employees (61 fulltime and 8 part-time), consisting of 4 in executive management, 12 in research and development, 2 in forensics, 3 in quality assurance and compliance, 3 in quality control, 3 in finance, accounting and human resources, 12 in operations/production, 7 in sales and marketing, 1 in shared services, 5 in information services, 2 in product development, 10 in clinical laboratory operations and 5 in clinical field operations. Expenses related to travel, marketing, salaries, and general overhead will be increased as necessary to support our growth in revenue. Any projected increase in human capital is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues and obtain sources of funding. Since June 2012, we have been working with Insperity Inc. to assist in managing many of our back-end administrative human resources, benefits, and payroll responsibilities. We are an at-will employer and generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to continue in our employment for any period of time, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. James A. Hayward. The initial term of Dr. Hayward’s current employment agreement was July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, and this employment agreement automatically renews for one-year periods subject to ninety days’ prior notice of non-renewal by Dr. Hayward or us in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the employment contract automatically renewed for an additional year.
