ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Physicians Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, and Physicians Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, were organized in April 2013 to acquire, selectively develop, own and manage healthcare properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery systems. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Physicians Realty” refer to the Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in July 2013. The Trust’s common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and it is included in the MSCI US REIT Index.
We have grown our portfolio of gross real estate investments from approximately $124 million at the time of our IPO to approximately $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 252 healthcare properties located in 30 states with approximately 13,624,598 net leasable square feet, which were approximately 96% leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 7.9 years. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 90% of the net leasable square footage of our portfolio was either on campus with a hospital or other healthcare facility or strategically affiliated with a hospital or other healthcare facility.
We receive a cash rental stream from healthcare providers under our leases. Approximately 93.0% of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2018 are from absolute and triple-net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property, including but not limited to real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs, and property management. This structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides relatively predictable cash flow. We seek to structure our leases to generate attractive returns on a long-term basis. Our leases typically have initial terms of 5 to 15 years and include annual rent escalators of approximately 1.5% to 3.0%. Our operating results depend significantly upon the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that our portfolio of medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities will enable us to generate stable cash flows over time because of the diversity of our tenants, staggered lease expiration schedule, long-term leases, and low historical occurrence of tenants defaulting under their leases. As of December 31, 2018, leases representing a percentage of our portfolio on the basis of leased square feet will expire as follows: 

Year | Portfolio Lease Expirations
MTM (1) | 0.9% 
2019 | 2.7% 
2020 | 3.6% 
2021 | 4.4% 
2022 | 4.9% 
2023 | 4.7% 
2024 | 5.9% 
2025 | 7.1% 
2026 | 27.5% 
2027 | 9.2% 
2028 | 10.1% 
Thereafter | 19.0% 
Total | 100.0% 


(1) | “MTM” means month-to-month. This line also includes 5 leases which expired on December 31, 2018, representing 0.2% of portfolio leasable square feet.

We invest in real estate that is integral to providing high quality healthcare services. Our properties are typically located on a campus with a hospital or other healthcare facilities or strategically affiliated with a hospital or other healthcare system. We believe the impact of government programs and continuing trends in the healthcare industry create attractive opportunities for us to invest in healthcare-related real estate. Our management team has significant public healthcare REIT experience and has long established relationships with physicians, hospitals, and healthcare delivery system decision makers that we believe will provide quality investment and growth opportunities. Our principal investments include medical office 
buildings, outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through a combination of stable and increasing dividends and potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and our common shares.

The Trust is a Maryland real estate investment trust and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our properties are owned by the Operating Partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other subsidiaries. The Trust is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of February 22, 2019, owned approximately 97.2% of the OP Units.
Our Objectives and Growth Strategy
Overview
Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental revenue and cash flow that generate reliable, increasing dividends, and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common shares. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to leverage our physician and hospital relationships nationwide to invest in off-market assets that maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, to invest in, own, and manage a diversified portfolio of high quality healthcare properties, and to understand our tenants’ real estate strategies, which we believe will drive high retention, high occupancy and reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow.

We intend to grow our portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties leased to physicians, hospitals, healthcare delivery systems, and other healthcare providers primarily through acquisitions of existing healthcare facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We may also selectively finance the development of new healthcare facilities through joint venture or fee arrangements with premier healthcare real estate developers. Generally, we expect to make investments in new development properties when approximately 80% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers and healthcare delivery systems that offer need-based healthcare services in sustainable healthcare markets. We focus our investment activity on the following types of healthcare properties:

• | medical office buildings;


• | outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities;


• | physician group practice clinics;


• | ambulatory surgery centers; and


• | specialty hospitals and treatment centers.


We believe that shifting consumer preferences, limited space in hospitals, the desire of patients and healthcare providers to limit non-essential services provided in a hospital setting, and cost considerations, among other trends, continue to drive the industry trend of performing procedures in outpatient facilities that have traditionally been performed in hospitals, such as surgeries and other invasive medical procedures. As these trends continue, we believe that demand for medical office buildings and similar healthcare properties will continue to rise, and that our investment strategy accounts for these trends.
We may invest opportunistically in life science facilities, assisted living facilities, independent senior living facilities, senior housing properties, and skilled nursing facilities. Consistent with the Trust’s qualification as a REIT, we may also opportunistically invest in companies that provide healthcare services, and in joint venture entities with operating partners structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).
In connection with our review and consideration of healthcare real estate investment opportunities, we generally take into account a variety of market considerations, including:

• | whether the property is anchored by a financially-sound healthcare delivery system or whether tenants have strong affiliation to a healthcare delivery system;


• | the performance of the local healthcare delivery system and its future prospects;


• | property location, with a particular emphasis on proximity to healthcare delivery systems;


• | demand for medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities, current and future supply of competing properties, and occupancy and rental rates in the market;


• | population density and growth potential;


• | ability to achieve economies of scale with our existing medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities or anticipated investment opportunities; and


• | existing and potential competition from other healthcare real estate owners and operators.

In addition, our management team has maintained a conservative balance sheet while investing over $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 in real estate assets since our IPO in July 2013. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility. From time to time, we replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes and equity, or alternative securities (i.e. debt convertible to equity). We selectively utilize capital market transactions in furtherance of our investment strategy, including, amending our Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and to reduce the interest rate margin applicable to borrowings, and the raising of an additional $9.9 million of equity through sales under our ATM Program (as hereinafter defined).
Business Strategy
We are focused on building and maintaining a portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties leased to physicians, hospitals, healthcare delivery systems, and other healthcare providers. Our investment strategy includes a focus on investments with the following key attributes:

• | We seek to invest in properties serving healthcare systems with dominant market share, high credit quality and those who are investing capital into their campuses. In particular, we seek to own off-market or selectively marketed assets with attractive demographics, economic growth, and high barriers to entry. We seek to invest in and maintain well occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare.


• | We emphasize ensuring an appropriate and balanced mix of tenants to provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campus. Our primary tenants are healthcare systems, academic medical centers and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance. We believe this helps ensure stability in our rental income and tenant retention over time.


• | We seek to maintain a core, critical portfolio of properties and to build our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator.


• | We seek to maintain or increase our average rental rates, and focus on actively leasing our vacant space and reducing leasing concessions.

In addition, we seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers and healthcare delivery systems that offer need-based healthcare services in sustainable healthcare markets, and consider the potential for long-term relationships and repeat business when assessing acquisition potential.
We actively manage our balance sheet to maintain our investment grade credit rating, to maintain an appropriate level of leverage and to preserve financing flexibility for funding of future acquisitions. In particular, we:

• | Continue to maintain a high level of liquidity, including borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility.


• | Maintain access to multiple sources of capital, including private debt issuances, public bond offerings, public equity offerings, and unsecured bank loans.


• | Periodically review our portfolio to consider potential dispositions of relatively lower quality properties to reinvest the proceeds into high quality properties.


• | Closely monitor our existing debt maturities and average interest rates.

2018 Highlights and Other Recent Developments
Investment Activity

• | For the full year 2018, we completed acquisitions of 4 operating healthcare properties and 1 land parcel. These properties are located in 5 states for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $252.8 million. In addition, we funded $18.2 million of other investments, including the issuance of loans and buyouts of noncontrolling interests, resulting in total investments of $271.0 million. We also acquired 2 properties and an adjacent land parcel through the conversion and satisfaction of a previously outstanding construction loan, valued at an aggregate $18.8 million. Additionally, we acquired 2 parcels of land, which we had previously ground leased, as the result of a lease restructuring arrangement and equity recapitalization.


• | During 2018, we sold 34 medical office buildings located in 9 states for approximately $220.4 million and recognized a net gain of approximately $11.7 million.


• | On January 18, 2019, the Company made a construction loan to finance the construction of a 27,000 square foot cancer center in Denton, Texas up to $15.5 million. The loan bears interest at a rate of 5.50% on the outstanding principal balance during construction and 6.25% following substantial completion. The loan is secured by a first deed of trust on the real estate and a completion guaranty, and includes a purchase option that is exercisable upon the first anniversary of substantial completion. The 100% pre-leased development is located across the street from the 208-bed Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton campus, and is expected to include expanded radiation oncology services, CT, PET-CT, and a state of the art infusion center with direct access to a healing garden. As of February 22, 2019, $5.0 million has been funded under the construction loan facility.


• | On February 13, 2019, the Company funded a $15.0 million term loan that is secured by a first mortgage on real estate being developed in Columbus, Ohio and by a full recourse guaranty. The loan bears interest at a rate of 8.5% during its one-year term.

Assets Slated for Disposition

• | We consider properties in three states, representing an aggregate of approximately 320,270 square feet of gross leasable area, to be slated for disposition as of December 31, 2018. These assets consist of five assets formerly affiliated with Foundation Healthcare, Inc. (formerly OTC: FDNH) (“Foundation Healthcare”) and one additional property which we believe no longer meets our core business strategy from a geography and line of business perspective. 

Capital Markets and Dividends

• | In August 2016, we entered into separate At Market Issuance Sales Agreements (the “Sales Agreements”) with each of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., JMP Securities LLC, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., and Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (the “Agents”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300.0 million, through the Agents (the “ATM Program”). During the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2018, we issued and sold pursuant to the ATM Program 570,551 common shares at a weighted average price of $17.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $9.9 million.

Our Industry and Market Opportunity
The nature of healthcare delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among healthcare providers and increased pressure on these providers to integrate more efficient real estate solutions in order enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. In particular, we believe the following factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in healthcare properties.
$3.3 Trillion Healthcare Industry Projected to Grow to $5.7 Trillion (and 19.7% of U.S. GDP) by 2026
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), healthcare spending accounted for 17.9% of U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) in 2016. The general aging of the population, driven by the Baby Boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, are key drivers of the growth in healthcare expenditures. The anticipated continuing increase in demand for healthcare services, together with an evolving complex and costly regulatory environment, changes in medical technology and reductions in government reimbursements are expected to pressure capital-constrained healthcare providers to find cost effective solutions for their real estate needs.
We believe the demand by healthcare providers for healthcare real estate will increase as healthcare spending in the United States continues to increase. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2017-2026, national healthcare expenditures continue to rise and are projected to grow from an estimated $3.5 trillion in 2017 to $5.7 trillion by 2026, representing an average annual rate of growth of 5.5%, reaching a projected 19.7% of GDP in 2026.

Aging Population
The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for healthcare as older persons generally utilize healthcare services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to more than double from 49.2 million to nearly 94.7 million and the 85 and older population is expected to more than triple, from 6.4 million to 19.0 million, between 2016 and 2060. Also according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of older Americans is growing as a percentage of the total U.S. population with the number of persons older than 65 estimated to comprise 15.2% of the total U.S. population in 2016 and projected to grow to 23.5% by 2060.
We believe that healthcare expenditures for the population over 65 years of age will continue to rise as a disproportionate share of healthcare dollars is spent on older Americans. To illustrate, in 2012 the elderly (65+ years old) represented only 14% of the population while accounting for 34% of all healthcare-related spending. We believe the older population group increasingly will require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments and that this increased demand for healthcare services will create a substantial need for additional medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry in many regions of the United States. Additionally, we believe there will likely be a focus on lowering the cost of outpatient care to support the aging U.S. population, which will continue to support medical office and outpatient facility property demand in the long term. For example, beginning in 2019, CMS expanded the list of procedures that can be performed and reimbursed in outpatient surgery centers to include 12 cardiac catherization diagnostic procedures and 5 ancillary procedures. We believe these trends will result in a substantial increase in the number of properties meeting our investment criteria.
We believe advances in medical technology will continue to enable healthcare providers to identify and treat once fatal illnesses and improve the survival rate of critically ill and injured patients who will require continuing medical care. Along with these technical innovations, the U.S. population is growing older and living longer.

Affordable Care Act 
The Affordable Care Act (as hereinafter defined) constituted a significant overhaul of many aspects of healthcare regulations and health insurance, and created the framework for healthcare services over the near term. It required every American to have health insurance or be subjected to a tax. Those who cannot afford health insurance are offered insurance subsidies or Medicaid coverage. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. However, the Affordable Care Act will remain in place pending an appeal. 
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 50 million Americans did not have healthcare insurance in 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The HHS reported that approximately 28.1 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2016. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation, executive orders and events, as well as their potential impact on our business, are discussed more fully under Item 1, “Business,” under the caption “Certain Government Regulations.” 
We believe the increase in the number of Americans with access to health insurance will result in an increase in physician office visits and an overall rise in healthcare utilization which in turn will drive a need for expansion of medical, outpatient, and smaller specialty hospital facilities. We also believe the increased dissemination of health research through media outlets, marketing of healthcare products, and availability of advanced screening techniques and medical procedures have contributed to a more engaged population of healthcare users and has created increased demand for customized facilities providing specialized, preventive and integrative healthcare services.
We further believe the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are designed to lower certain reimbursement amounts under Medicare and tie reimbursement levels to the quality of services provided will increase the pressure on healthcare providers to become more efficient in their business models, invest capital in their businesses, lower costs and improve the quality of care, which in turn will drive healthcare systems to monetize their real estate assets and create demand for new, modern and specialized facilities.
Clinical Care Continues to Shift to Outpatient Care
According to the American Hospital Association, procedures traditionally performed in hospitals, such as certain types of surgery, are increasingly moving to outpatient facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals, and lower costs in the outpatient environment. This continuing shift toward delivering healthcare services in an outpatient environment rather than a traditional hospital environment increases the need for additional outpatient facilities and smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals. Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and others have shown that healthcare is delivered more cost effectively and with higher patient satisfaction when it is provided on an outpatient basis. Increasingly, hospital admissions are reserved for the critically ill, and less critical patients are treated on an outpatient basis with recuperation in their own homes. We believe healthcare market trends toward outpatient care will continue to push healthcare services out of larger, older, inefficient hospitals and into newer, more efficient and conveniently located outpatient facilities and smaller specialized hospitals. We believe that increased specialization within the medical field is also driving demand for medical facilities designed specifically for particular specialties and that physicians want to locate their practices in medical office space that is in or adjacent to these facilities.
Impact of BBA on Outpatient Care 
Section 603 Assets: Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “2015 BBA”) generally prohibits hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) from charging preferential hospital outpatient department rates for Medicare patients treated in “off-campus” locations on or after January 1, 2017, potentially impacting their profitability. These preferential Medicare rates are only permitted if the hospital provides HOPD services in a building within 250 yards of the hospital’s main inpatient location. A hospital HOPD can be grandfathered by the 2015 BBA even if the location is outside the 250 yard distance. Under the statutory authority, an off-campus HOPD facility in existence as of November 2, 2015 can be “grandfathered” and can continue to be paid at the preferential HOPD rates, if, among other things, the hospital was billing HOPD services in that location on a HOPD basis as of November 2, 2015 and continues to provide those services in that location. On November 21, 2018, the Secretary issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2019, that eliminates the higher, Outpatient Prospective Payment System reimbursement rate for evaluation and management services provided by Grandfathered HOPD locations. The Secretary, instead, will only reimburse for evaluation and management services at the lower, Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rate that new non-grandfathered off-campus HOPD locations receive. See Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare Program: Changes to Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs, Department of Health and Human Services, 83 Fed. Reg. 58,818 (November 21, 2018) (“Final Rule”). The American Hospital Association (the “AHA”) and a number of hospitals have sued the Secretary in federal court to enforce the plain meaning of Section 603 of the BBA and restore the right to Grandfathered HOPD reimbursement rates. “Grandfathered” hospitals providing HOPD services in our portfolio are referred to as 603 assets in our SEC reports and other public disclosures.
We own a number of assets that will continue to be reimbursed at hospital inpatient rates, which we refer to as “603 assets” after the applicable section of the BBA. Rent derived from these 603 assets accounts for approximately 18% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. Depending upon the implementation of the regulations, the BBA may enhance the value of these 603 assets because existing HOPDs may lose their higher reimbursements rates should they choose to change locations.
Portfolio Summary

Please see “Item 2. Properties” for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2018.

Geographic Concentration

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 15.4% of our total annualized base rent was derived from properties located in Texas. 
As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the Texas economy or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental, or competitive conditions in Texas could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in the Texas market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption, “Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas in which we conduct business, and in particular Texas, and other areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Customer Concentration

We receive substantially all of our revenue as rent payments from tenants under leases of space in our healthcare properties, with our five largest tenants based upon rental revenue representing approximately $54.9 million, or 19.2%, of the annualized base rent from our properties as of December 31, 2018. No one tenant represents more than 5.7% of our total annualized base rent; however, 19.2% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018 is from tenants affiliated with CHI. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants’ businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. Our business, financial position, or results of operation could be materially adversely affected if CHI were to experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, or results of operations.
Competition

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers, and developers of healthcare-related real estate properties and other investors such as private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for healthcare-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target healthcare properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel, and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for healthcare properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments.
We also face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Seasonality

Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become, subject to material seasonal fluctuations.

Employees

At December 31, 2018, we had 70 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.
Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our properties may affect our results of operations.”
 Certain Government Regulations
Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure, protection of patient health information, and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management, and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, enforcement of these laws, loss of licensure, or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.”
In 2017, Congress came within a single vote of repealing of the Affordable Care Act and substantially reducing funding to the Medicaid program. New legislation may be introduced in the future, proposing changes, if not full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Beyond this, significant changes to commercial health insurance and government-sponsored insurance (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) remain possible. Commercial and government payors are likely to continue imposing larger discounts and tighter cost controls upon operators, through reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in payment methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise. A shift toward less comprehensive health insurance coverage and increased consumer cost-sharing on health expenditures could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Healthcare Legislation
Health Reform Laws.  On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively with other subsequently enacted federal health care laws and regulations, the “Health Reform Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees. The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially-eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows states not to participate in the expansion-and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion-without losing their existing Medicaid funding. As of December 31, 2017, 18 states have pursued this option. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government paid for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states now are expected to pay for part of those additional costs. 
Challenges to the Health Reform Laws and Potential Repeal and/or Further Reforms under Trump Administration.  Since the enactment of the Health Care Laws, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws, including the case that was before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell.  Although the Supreme Court in Burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federally-facilitated health care exchanges 
on June 25, 2015, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the Health Reform Laws, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal, amend or challenge the validity of all or part of the Health Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal, amendment or challenge would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us.
In 2017, President Trump and Congress unsuccessfully sought to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order stating that it is the administration’s official policy to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authority and responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to, among other matters, delay implementation of or grant an exemption from any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, and others. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate penalty to zero beginning in 2019. The elimination of the penalties does not remove the requirement to obtain healthcare coverage; however, without penalties there effectively will be no enforcement. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the provisions of the individual mandate were not severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, rendering the remainder of the Affordable Care Act invalid as well. The Affordable Care Act will remain in place pending an appeal of the court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
It is possible that Congress will continue to consider other legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act or repeal and replace some or all elements of the Affordable Care Act. 
We cannot predict the effect of the Executive Order, the Tax Act’s 2019 repeal of the individual mandate penalty on the Affordable Care Act, or the Texas court’s decision or any appeal thereof, other state-based litigation, or whether Congress’ attempt to repeal or repeal and replace the law will be successful. Further, we cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be amended or modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants’ operations or the net effect of this law on us. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by any repeal or modification of the law, our revenue and operations may be materially adversely affected as well.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state, and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.
Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare program and state and Medicaid program, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance payors, managed care organizations (MCOs), health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.
We cannot predict whether future Congressional proposals will seek to reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other payors to reduce healthcare costs are likely to continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. For example, payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. The Healthcare Reform Laws and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us.
Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws, and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies and laboratories, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion, and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
