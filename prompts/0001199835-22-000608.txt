Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to seek and acquire new business assets in the life sciences industry and begin operations with these new assets. We do not intend to limit our activities to a particular field within the life sciences sector and we have not established any particular criteria upon which we shall consider a business opportunity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful with our new business objective.
 
Our management will have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity in the life sciences sector. We are dependent on the judgment of our management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we will consider, among other factors, the following:
 

● | costs associated with pursuing a new business opportunity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | growth potential of the new business opportunity;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | experiences, skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | necessary capital requirements;
--+--------------------------------


● | the competitive position of the new business opportunity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | stage of business development;
--+-------------------------------


● | the market acceptance of the potential products and services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | the regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.
 
The time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
 
Our management intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Companys affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project the amount of time that our management will actually devote to the Companys business objectives.
 
We intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an Investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore, to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Recent Activities
 
On April 11, 2022, we, through our newly established, wholly owned subsidiary, Duo Sciences, Inc. (“DSI”), acquired an exclusive license from Cedoga Consulting, LLC (“Cedoga”) to distribute in the USA, Canada and Mexico, certain intellectual property of Cedoga relating to animal nutrition and animal supplements (the “Cedoga IP”). In exchange for these license rights, we agreed to issue Cedoga 300,000 (post-reverse split (discussed below)) shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay Cedoga royalties from sub-licensing the Cedoga IP on the following terms:
● | 90% of net royalties for sales and initial payments up to $100,000,000 per calendar year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 95% of net royalties received for continuing sales above $100,000,000 per calendar year; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 90% of any lump sum up-front payment sub-licensing fees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
We also gave Cedoga an option to purchase 200,000 (post-reverse split) shares of our common stock when net sales of the Cedoga IP exceed $100,000,000.
 
On April 19, 2022, we, through DSI, signed an exclusive representative and sublicensing agreement with Lucy Pet Products Inc. (Lucy) pursuant to which Lucy has agreed to manufacture, market and distribute on our behalf pet products created from the Cedoga IP. Lucy paid us a one-time sublicensing fee of $100,000 on the signing of this agreement and will pay us royalties equal to 5% of their Net Revenue, calculated and payable quarterly. Net Revenue, for purposes of our agreement with Lucy, is defined as total revenue less direct cost of materials, manufacturing, packaging and delivery expenses and less excise, sales or similar taxes.
 
Historical Development
 
The Company was incorporated as Alternative Energy & Environmental Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on June 10, 2010, to develop and license an innovative biotechnology for the environmentally friendly and cost-effective extraction of natural gas (coalbed methane) from low-producing, depleted and abandoned coal mines in the U.S. The Company was not successful in developing this business and discontinued its related operations.
 
The Company changed its name in 2014 to Unique Growing Solutions, Inc. and again in 2015 to Point of Care Nano-Technology, Inc.
 
On February 25, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license Agreement (the License Agreement) with Lamina Equities Corporation (Lamina), a private corporation owned by Dr. Raouf Guirguis. The License Agreement related to intellectual property for diagnosing illness in humans via a saliva test. In connection with signing the License Agreement, the Company appointed Dr. Guirguis as its Chief Executive Officer and issued to him 750,000 (post-reverse split) shares of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, resulting in a change of control of the Company with Dr. Guirguis becoming the Companys majority stockholder. The Company did not have, however, the financial resources to pursue business development relating to the Lamina license.
 
On April 15, 2021, Dr. Guirguis resigned from all of his positions with the Company appointing Mr. Nicholas DeVito as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and sole director. In consideration for the services that Mr. DeVito would be providing to the Company, the Company issued to Mr. DeVito 1,000 shares of its super-voting, non-convertible Class A preferred stock. These shares of non-convertible Class A preferred stock vote together with the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock as a single class and represent eighty percent (80%) of all votes entitled to be voted at any annual or special meeting of the Companys shareholders or action by written consent of shareholders. This issuance of the 1,000 shares of Series A non-convertible preferred stock to Mr. Devito constituted a change of control of the Company giving Mr. Devito control of 80% of the voting power of the Company.
 
The Company and Dr. Guirguis entered into a certain assignment and assumption agreement and a separate transfer agreement pursuant to which the Company transferred to DRG Transfer Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (DRG), all of the legacy assets of the Company as of April 15, 2021, comprised as of that date of the License Agreement and the name of the Company (i.e., Point of Care Nanotechnology, Inc.) and any outstanding debts of the Company generated while Dr. Guirguis operated the Company, measured as of April 15, 2021, which as of that date consisted solely of unknown contingent liabilities (which cannot be identified or quantified at this time and which are expected to be non-material or nil). The Company transferred ownership of DRG to Dr. Guirguis in exchange for the return of 520,000 (post-reverse split) shares of our common stock then held by Dr. Guirguis (The Consideration Shares). Dr. Guirguis has agreed to allow the Company to continue to use its existing name for an indefinite period of time.
