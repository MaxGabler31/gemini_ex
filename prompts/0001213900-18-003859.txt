Item 1. Business
General
 
Prior to February 6, 2018, we were a blank check company organized under the laws of Delaware in April 2015 under the name of JM Global Holding Company (“JM Global”). On July 29, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock for an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-204995). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 250,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, issued to Zhong Hui Holding Limited, our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000. A total of $50,000,000 from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders. The units began trading on July 24, 2015 on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “WYIGU”. Commencing on September 11, 2015, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbols “WYIGU,” “WYIG” and “WYIGW.”
 
Until December 31, 2017, our business was limited to organizational activities, our initial public offering and the search for a suitable business transaction.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 6, 2018, we consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) following a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) where our stockholders considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt that Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), by and among by and among (i) JM Global; (ii) Zhong Hui Holding Limited, a Republic of Seychelles registered company, in the capacity under the Share Exchange Agreement as the Purchaser Representative (including any successor Purchaser Representative appointed in accordance therewith, the “Purchaser Representative”); (iii) China Sunlong Environmental Technology, Inc., a Cayman Islands business company with limited liability (“Sunlong”),; (iv) each of the shareholders of Sunlong named on Annex I of the Share Exchange Agreement (collectively, the “Sellers”); and (v) Chuanliu Ni, a Chinese citizen who is the Chief Executive Officer and director of Sunlong, in the capacity as the representative for the Sellers in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Share Exchange Agreement (the “Seller Representative”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement JM Global acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Sunlong in exchange for 8,995,428 newly-issued shares of common stock of the Company to Sellers. 899,544 of these newly-issued shares are held in escrow for 18 months from the closing date of the Business Combination as a security for the Company and the Sellers’ indemnification obligations under the Share Exchange Agreement. As a result of the Business Combination, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of Sunlong, became the controlling shareholders of the Company and Sunlong became a subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein Sunlong is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Upon closing of the Business Combination, we changed its name to TMSR Holding Company Limited. The Company’s units ceased trading as of February 6, 2018, and the Company’s common stock and warrants started to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbols “TMSR” and “TMSRW,” respectively, on February 7, 2018.
 
After the Business Combination, TMSR, through Sunlong, operates two business divisions: Shengrong, which engages in the production and sales of solid waste recycling and comprehensive utilization equipment; and TJComex, which engages in provision of commodity exchange services and ship exchange consulting services. Shengrong, is focused on the research, development, production and sale of an array of solid waste recycling systems for the mining and industrial sectors in the PRC. Shengrong provides end users in these markets with a clean alternative to traditional waste disposal by significantly reducing solid waste discharge into the environment and enabling such users to extract value from valuable metals and other industrial waste materials.TJComex is engaged in iron ore trading, wine import and resale, and Agarwood trading. TJComex also generated revenue from ship exchange consulting services during the first quarter 2017 but this may not be the future focus of TJComex.
