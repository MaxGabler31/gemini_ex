Since our establishment, our growth has been tremendous in Malaysia. From a mere selection of two (2) products, the company had expanded to eight (8) products by 2014. With the strong leadership of our company’s Chief Executive Officer; Vincent Leong, our products are now consumed around the world, such Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau and China.

Coupled with the extensive networks we had built since our inception, the nature of our job has become easier and efficient to reach out to our clients.

As a result, our customers’ base has been growing exponentially and resulted in a robust brand image of our company.
