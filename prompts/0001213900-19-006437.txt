Item 1. Business
 
Company mission and overview.
 
Natur’s vision is for technology to be the force of our innovation as we build culturally relevant consumer products that nurture the human body. The mission of Natur is to deliver 100% natural products that are good for everyone and for nature, with an aim to sell products that meet or exceed consumer expectations for health, wellness and good taste. Natur specially selects plant-based ingredients, including Hemp Cannabidiol (CBD), fruits and vegetables, committing not to use concentrates, preservatives, stabilizers or additives in our products. Natur further invests in sustainability projects to reduce the environmental impact of our own activities.
 
Business Overview
 
Natur integrates new manufacturing technologies with standard practices to extend the shelf life of its products and yet remain Naturalicious (natural & delicious) to build out its value chain for the burgeoning market of nutritious beverages and healthy snacks with and without CBD or other nutrient dense fusions. It has delivered its products in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and plans on expanding in Europe and ultimately the United States. Our understanding and application of the technological aspects of manufacturing assures a pathogen-free food and beverage experience that preserves the nutrients and enzymes to the maximum level possible, while retaining the raw fresh nature of the products. The result is what we believe to be the best tasting product with the maximum “goodness” and highest nutrient density -- something the consumer seeks more and more in our target markets.
 
Our commitment to deliver to consumers the best products possible in the market is strengthened with the market experience of our business partner, that is also a significant shareholder, the AMC Group, which is one of the leading European suppliers of “white label” natural juices to over 70 of the largest retail chains in Europe. AMC is well known as the sector’s innovation leader with proprietary manufacturing, software and production technologies.
 
The AMC proprietary technologies, which at the core of the proposition incorporate HPP (Cold High-Pressure Processing) and SNFC (Super Not From Concentrate), hold in the taste of freshness and yet extends shelf life to over 6 months. AMC was one of the company’s founders that invested initially in AMC NT to lock in the strategic links between the businesses.
 
The clear differentiator of the Company is the natur™ brand which is supported by its disruptive marketing. Yes, we are branding nature. The Company finds that consumers are interested in “what we produce and how we voice this to the market” more than how it is made. From an investment perspective, this is a fundamental component of our business model as we are not having to commit very significant capex to building our own modern production and bottling facilities to deliver into the increasing demand for our product.
 
In the future we anticipate delivering documented nutrigenomic (precision nutrition) properties that we believe will be an aid to personal weight management, increase energy, lower cholesterol, counter sleep disorders and boost immunity response. We believe that these product aspects will position the Natur products at the top of the European market at a mid-market price point. This profile will be accessible internationally, as we have already undertaken preliminary discussions with distributors in major international markets outside Europe.
 
Our market profile will be further enhanced with the new Natur personalized snacking/juicing experience that will accelerate the trend towards “snackification” already present in more mature markets in the United States and Europe.
 
This all reflects the Natur brand characteristics, shaped by the management vision of becoming a leader in the “hi-tech health” food and beverage marketplace; achieved by responding to changing market needs and staying continuously ahead of emerging trends. Natur also intends to address the demand of the consumer for knowledge about what he/she consumes with a greater level of supply chain transparency.

Corporate Management
 
The Company and Natur have gathered a top team of experienced management and consultants in the field of food and beverage, who have an in-depth knowledge of the market arena for our products and yet have the right fit of discipline and entrepreneurial vision and drive.
 
The Natur Holding non-executive board has top industry relevant experience and has a hands-on drive to make the company successful and to gain a leadership position in the healthy product food and beverage market place through the offering of a palette of products that not only are natural and delicious but with functional beneficial properties and can also be supplied as organic. Their expertise and insights in the digital world will also help drive the Natur to embrace these new delivery frontiers.
 
From Farm to Fridge
 
The founders and management believe Natur will evolve to become one of the leaders in the European market and later in the United States farm to fridge market segment, supplying superior fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies, and natural and organic snacks. Natur is able to accommodate a great speed of market innovation and is able to meet market demands quickly; therefore, Natur believes that it is well positioned to establish its market share and partner with the major international leaders to distribute our products.

Product Development
 
Since inception the Company has been defining and refining its market and its innovative products accordingly.
 
The target group is composed of health-conscious consumers looking for convenient fast-food alternatives. This drives product development toward delivering a healthy, tasty and refreshing experience with 100% natural plant-based, fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies and snacks to take away. Superior product quality and affordability allow the Company to broaden the consumer potential.
 
Initially the Company developed an extensive line of cold pressed HPP juices consisting of 23 SKU’s, with consumer trending monikers, including fruit and vegetable juices, coconut waters, coconut-water-based smoothies, dairy based smoothies, and nut milks.
 

Fruit & Vegetable Juices | Coconut Waters | Smoothies | Nutmilks 
-----------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------+----------------------
Tropical Greens | Lemon Aid | Whey Cool | Strawberry Nut Fields
The Clean | Coco Beach | Powerhouse | La Vida 
Power Plant | Berry Bliss | Chilling in the Tropics | Choc Fix 
Spicy Greens | | Berry’d Treasure | Nut-tritious 
The Force | | Blueberry Hill | Nutcracker Sweet 
Fountain of Youth | | | 
Beet the Blues | | | 
Refresher | | | 
Berrylicious | | | 
Pearfection | | | 

 
In 2016 operating with market and consumer responsiveness, the Company optimized the original SKUs for efficiency and simultaneously created four exclusive juices for a larger retail chain in The Netherlands. These were sold as the “SmartLine” and included Coco Beach, Refresher (later called Drunk in Love), Power Plant and The Force.

The Company further developed a tighter focused line of beverages to the rest of the market: Spicy Greens, The Clean, Berrylicious, Pearfection, Fountain of Youth, Beet the Blues, and Whey Cool.
 
Once the retailer exclusive period ended, it allowed the sale of the SmartLine to all other retailers the company again optimized the line around consumer needs resulting in the following flavors to be marketed:
 In 250ml PET bottles - Spicy Greens, The Clean, Berrylicious, Pearfection, Fountain of Youth, Beet the Blues, Drunk in Love. In 100ml PET shots - The Charger, The Glow, and The Clean. The Company in 2017 made an entry in to the ’snack drinks’ arena with two 250 ml robust SKUs called Cereal Smoothie, and Morning Glory.
 
Each time the Company innovates, it considers the European markets best suited for distribution and labels its products accordingly. It is common for the Company to ensure that product can be sold with the proper labels in The Netherlands, France, and the UK; with opportunity assessments before label creation in other languages.
 
It is common to earn ‘rotations’ for brand presence in large, visible, multi-outlet transportation retailers. In such cases the Company innovates around the needs of those large retailers. In one such case the Company innovated a line of lemonades and orange juices in the single serve package and in multi-serve one-liter packaging.
 
The Company has an innovation pipeline for 2019 through 2021. These new innovations include CBD infused versions of our current product lines, and new entrants in Health and Beauty and Animal Care. Some of these CBD infused snacks have been introduced on the eCommerce site in the first quarter of 2019. Already formulated are the products and labels required for a US Market entry. Additionally, the Company is finalizing the Innovative Snacking Occasions product line and seasonal flavor varieties that bring new consumer trial to the brand.
 
The market shift toward acceptable functional additives is being vetted and innovated by the company so that product introductions might include plant waters, plant proteins, animal proteins (collagen), live cultures, and plant-based wellness supplements.
 
A helpful tool for the Company’s innovation process is its flagship store in the Amsterdam canal district, where consumer interactions can be noted and assessed by the marketing team. In the shop, the Company has introduced a CBD based shot in 30 ml and is formulating other edibles. This is the beginning of other innovations in Fruit Waters / Waters, Protein Drinks, Non-Dairy Nutmilks / Non-allergenic (alternative) Nutmilks, Vinegars, Alternative Sweeteners, Soups and other functional blends.
 
In the creation of a snack line, the Company has development work being performed in the areas of Chocolates, Crackers, Chips, Fruit, nut & granola bars, seaweed snacks, and cookies.
 
‘Next from Natur’
 (A) Natur Breaks 
 
In close conjunction with a third-party manufacturer in 2018, the Company has invested heavily in New Product Development (NPD). Consequently, the Company is proud to be ready to launch in Q2 2019 it’s innovation in Snacking: ‘Natur Break’. The product portfolio extension consists of three variants:

● | Natur. Mango-Carrot-Pumpkin Break 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natur. Strawberry-Raspberry-Beetroot Break 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natur. Apple-spinach-Avocado break 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
‘The delicious ‘better-for-you snack’ line:
 

● | 100% fruit & veggies (225gr)
--+-----------------------------


● | Crunchy separately packaged topping with nuts and seeds (20gr)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------

--+------------


● | Cold Pressed
--+-------------


● | One serving contains 33% of vegetables- and 50% fruit of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The introduction is fully on trend:
 

● | Increasing demand for healthy and honest food. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing awareness about fructose sugars in fruit. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities for combining vegetables and fruit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth of convenience and healthy ‘on-the-go’ solutions 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This new range is in perfect complementary harmony with the vision and existing portfolio of Natur. Based on conducted extensive qualitative consumer panel research in January 2019 and initial trade response and acceptance, the Company believes this addition to the portfolio has the potential to add value to the category.
 
(B) Natur Functionals
 
The Company’s mission is to leverage technology as the driving force of innovation to build culturally relevant natural and/or organic consumer products that are beneficial to the human body and improve the general wellbeing. Putting this into practice the Company is developing two new product line extensions:

1. | Beverages and snacks infused with Cannabidiol (CBD) 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is the non-psychoactive cannabinoid of the cannabis plant, often known as hemp. CBD is not the THC cannabinoid of the plant that is intoxicating substance and is illegal in many jurisdictions. CBD is legal worldwide, although a controlled substance in Canada, we do not deal in any illegal substance.
 
CBD is extracted and separated from specific varieties of the industrial hemp plant. Although CBD can be found in other plants, it is the hemp plant that is used because of its abundance in the plant, typically representing up to 40% of its extracts. When separated into its pure form, it cannot provide the intoxication effects of THC.
 
CBD is typically used for health reasons. Although there is much research to be done in the field, it is believed that there are a wide range of health benefits. CBD products may be used for wellness purposes such as to aid sleep, or for pain or anxiety management: they do not require prescription.
 
The Company’s plans on developing and commercializing medicinal and health-focused Functional Natural Cannabis and hemp products that will embrace production transparency GMP product quality standards and novel technologies.
 

2. | Beverages and snacks with Functional Nutraceuticals

A. | Immunity

B. | Anti-Stress

C. | Appetite Control

We believe that the opportunity for the Natur products can be summarized as follows:
 

● | globally there is a generic shift towards a healthier lifestyle and healthier foods that is already well established in the more advanced North American and European markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is a fast-growing European market for healthy natural juices and snack foods that are easy-to-consume products suited to the needs of a modern lifestyle;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | illustrating these trends, within the Benelux and UK fruit juice market for example, there is a continuing shift to more complex and more expensive premium juices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a steadily increasing number of consumers are willing to pay a premium for niche brands with superior quality, functional outcomes and special drinking experiences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the major European retailers (including supermarket chains) are evaluating how they can differentiate their respective offerings and enhance consumer experience to attract customers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | governments are legislating against carbonated soft drinks with added sugar reinforcing consumers’ negative opinions of these products and accelerating a shift to raw/fresh natural drinks for all family members.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the above characteristics of the market in which we operate, we believe there are other consumer trends that we need to take into consideration. These include the following:
 

● | increased availability of vegetarian and vegan products
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | demand for healthy and responsible snacks
--+------------------------------------------


● | increase of alternative ingredients from nature
--+------------------------------------------------


● | ‘pure nature’ provides ‘feeling good’ to the consumer
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
The consumer trends also suggest that persons are wanting healthier products generally. Typically, the following factors are taken into consideration:
 

● | untreated products that do not use artificial coloring, flavors or preservatives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | non-GMO;
--+---------


● | Products that are better for the environment;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | more demand for gluten-free, halal or Kosher products (‘free from’)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | less sugar;
--+------------


● | less salt;
--+-----------


● | less calories; and
--+-------------------


● | no additives.
--+--------------

Consumers not only consume for taste, but also for the function of food. Natur is addressing these new factors in its products and marketing.
 
Craftmanship and Artisanship
 

● | more demand for artisan and fresh products
--+-------------------------------------------


● | discovery to new flavors and ethnic origin
--+-------------------------------------------


● | signature from the craftsman 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hero products and story telling 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | traceable to origin 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Sharing Online - Products should look visually attractive to share on social media.
 
Sustainable
 

● | consumers are spending more on sustainable products every year
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | no waste, from either the packaging or the product itself
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Clean Labels
 

● | call for transparency
--+----------------------


● | honesty about the ingredients (‘from field to fork’)
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | simple: less ingredients
--+-------------------------


● | simple: ingredients that do what they have to do
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | who makes the product, where and how?
--+--------------------------------------

 
More Eating Occasions - with smaller and healthier portions
 
Blurring
 

● | sports drinks become mainstream. Reducing difference between on-the-go and retail
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Food service becomes an important trigger.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
More Direct Consumption - new eating occasions
 
Premiumization - food is lifestyle. Increasing demand for premium variants.
 
Convenience - the consumers are increasingly rushing and are looking for solutions.
 
Differentiated Packaging - smaller production batches in alternative packaging
 
Online Shopping - continued rapid growth. Regular grocery shopping shifting to online
 
Tailored Offers - personal advantage e.g. consumer loyalty card
 
Super Powders - maca, matcha, turmeric, spirulina, kale
 
Technology - shelf life extension without additives
 
The Company believes there is now mainstream acceptance in the Netherlands, UK and throughout Europe of ordering food over the internet supported by a well-established fulfillment infrastructure for local delivery; there is no current significant competition from large international players in either the Netherlands or UK, nor wider European markets, in the cold-pressed natural juices market to the best of our knowledge. In the NFC market segment, there is no other brand that can match Natur’s Super NFC line in nutrient density, with ambient delivery possibilities for up to four weeks while retaining the organoleptic properties and a shelf life of up to six months.
 
Customer Sales Authorizations
 
The Company markets its products through five distinct channels in Europe – chain grocery, petrol and other smaller retail stores, direct to consumer/business through e-commerce, caterers, and wholesalers (who reach independent retailers and Food Service locations). Additionally, the Company operates a branded experiential consumer immersion store overlooking the Prinsengracht, one of the main canals of Amsterdam providing heavy foot traffic by natives and tourists.

The Company is building the brand through a combination of permanent shelf space and promotional rotational spaces. Over the past two years, in the Netherlands, these have included presence in the 700-store chain Albert Heijn, the oldest organization owned and operated by the Dutch supermarket operator Ahold and dominating the Food Grocery Market by 34,7% Market Share4, the progressive all-natural retailer Marqt (18 stores), and Plus Supermarkets (256 stores), to name a few. In the petrol sector, the Company conducts business for example with the BP, Total and Avia petrol chains.
 
In the UK, during the past two years, the Company served hundreds of independent natural food stores through direct relationships from a staff of several sales and marketing personnel, while undertaking a branded takeover of WHSmith transportation retailers in a large-scale rotational promotion. The Company has streamlined the market development for the UK and is resetting its strategies for a distributor-oriented expansion. The company’s extended shelf life technologies will support the anticipated slowing at the border of a non-deal Brexit.
 
Presently, with distribution in several hundred Dutch retailers, and with a new distribution agreement with one of the UK’s most customer-centric natural foods distributors, the Company is poised for expansion to new authorizations in existing and new markets. An example of such expansion is an authorization pending with the 600-store chain Jumbo, 2nd largest Food Grocery Retailer with 19,1% Market Share,2 which is expected to place Natur products in 60 of its ‘on the go’ stores in 2019.
 
In 2018 HMS Host and Albert Heijn each represented more than ten percent of company revenues, together representing 58% of our revenues. In 2017 no one represented more than ten percent of company revenues.
 
Direct to Consumer & Businesses
 
The Company has invested in an e-commerce platform from the https://nl.natur.eu/ buy now page that provides an end to end solution to direct-to-consumer sales as well as shipments to businesses. This meets the expanding need for healthy snacking where consumers live and work. Customers have the option to select a two-hour time window for when they want to receive their order. For these customers the Company is using an external logistics company providing warehousing and order fulfillment. For business direct customers the Company is using Leen Menken as logistics partner for the Netherlands.
Wholesale
 
Through wholesalers like Lekkerland (€13 billion turnover in 2017), Sligro (€3 billion turnover in 2017) and Bidfood (€700 million turnover in 2017) the Company is distributing its products to a large variety of smaller outlets in both on- and off-trade channels. From cafe to caterer, canteen to health care institution and from hotel to restaurant.

Catering
 
The Company pursues the catering category with the goal of prestigious availability for brand building and commercial interest. The Company is selling to multiple sport clubs, offices, schools and many other public locations. This channel also includes airline catering companies. The Company is in final negotiations with a larger Dutch provider in this channel. This channel also includes outreach to convention centers where the Company has in place an agreement with RAI Amsterdam (largest in The Netherlands), exposing the brand to 1.6 million visitors each year. Through our partner Absolute Taste, the Company has provided healthy juices to The Ryder Cup, several Formula 1 races, Association of Tennis Professionals Finals and The Shard in London.
Festivals and Events
 
The Netherlands are famous for their festivals. Natur is attending the main dance festivals offering this crowd healthy refreshments, while also selling through regular bars and via mobile sales and sampling teams. Through the customers like Absolute Taste, the company delivers to international large festivals.
 
Anticipated new business authorizations 
 
The Company is evaluating expansion in to additional European country markets and the US over the next twelve to twenty-four months.
 
The first such European expansion will be to Switzerland, which is anticipated to be through Migros, Switzerland’s largest retail company, its largest supermarket chain and largest employer. Migros is also one of the forty largest retailers in the world. With over 600 retail grocery stores, over 200 specialty markets and over 315 restaurants in 5 countries, the Company is working with Migros to select the ideal initial 200 outlets for a phase one implementation of Natur product availability.
 
The company is also in discussions with a distributor for France, which is expected to start in the second quarter of 2019
 
Also, in 2019, the Company is looking to extend the addressable market for its products with large distribution partners and/or retailers in Germany, Austria, Israel, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
 
Entering the United States market will require a calculated expansion plan, beginning with the markets highest indexing in the development of healthy eating and drinking products. New York City is one such market, along with Los Angeles, San Francisco and Central Texas. The United States market is highly reliant on distribution agreements; and those distribution agreements are struck most easily when large natural foods chains authorize the Company’s product lines. The Company plans to rely heavily on innovation to foster success in the United States where working with functional supplements and innovating snacking allow for disruption and competitive advantage.
 
Distribution 
 
The Company employs the practice of distributing product through independent, third party routes to market. In the Netherlands, the Company deploys product to market through a contract relationship with Leen Menken Food Service Logistics who delivers greater than 10% of the Company’s total Netherlands volume. This professional contract provider, from its distribution center in Zoetermeer, is centrally located in the Randstad, close to the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport. With 15,000 pallet spaces, the Company’s relationship is scalable and efficient for refrigerated storage and transportation. Leen Menken applies work automation according to the latest technical development. On the other hand, for certain activities, dedicated human attention is needed, provided by a workforce of more than fifty people. Menken is certified, and the distribution center works according to the quality requirements of ISO 9001, BRC, SKAL, Lean and Green & AEO.
 
In the UK, the Company is using CLF Wholesaler to fulfill distribution requirements in that country. Founded in 1998, CLF are the leading UK wholesaler of premium products such as those in the categories of sports nutrition, organic and health food products, vitamins, minerals and supplements, personal care, household products and now chilled and frozen products. CLF offers a daily delivery service from their warehousing facility in Southampton, Hampshire, and successfully provides continuity of supply across over 15,000 products from over 750 leading brands. Their mission is to build upon their position as the wholesaler of choice to the independent health food trade.

Production 
 
The Company relies on more than 10% of its salable product from its relationship with contract packer and investor AMC Group. This special contribution to the strategic business plan represents a high barrier to entry for any potential competing participant, as the scale and breadth of AMC’s operations are unmatched in Europe. Further, it is the platform on which the Company’s plans for the European market will be delivered.
 
The Company has an integrated product offering primarily using unique cold-pressed juices as a basis for (functional) supplements, boosters and natural snacks. The products are considered as “safe foods” due to our Pure Pulse (PEF 2.0) and High-Pressure Processing (HPP) processes. Pathogens receive a 5+Log reduction while all the goodness, minerals, nutrients and enzymes remain intact. Also, thanks to the extended shelf life and consumption period of the Company’s products the process produces less waste. The Company will deploy unique patented PEF 2.0 technology which creates a product that is not only cold pressed, but also actually enhances the natural flavors. The PEF processing technology allows the Company to be extremely price competitive as less factory workers are needed for this line production technology and, unlike with HPP production, no expensive refrigerated working environment is needed.
 
For products not produced by AMC, representing a very small percentage of current volume, the Company is working with other leading Dutch and European contract manufacturers.
 
Sourcing of Raw Materials
 
The Company relies on the expertise of the AMC Group for sourcing fruit and vegetable juice. The AMC processes begin with proprietary breeds of fruits and vegetables, taking the most advanced and many times patented proprietary extraction methods. Further, they have pioneered proprietary methods for shelf life extension with the greatest retention of enzymes, nutrient density and natural taste.
 
AMC Group accounted in the aggregate for more than 10.3% of the current accounts payable at December 31, 2018, and the AMC Group companies accounted for more than 21,5% of accounts payable at December 31, 2017.
 
Government Regulations 
 
There are many food related regulations found in the laws of the different markets in which our products are distributed. The regulatory regime is likely to expand and become more complicated over time in each of our markets. Two principal governing bodies provide guidance and / or regulation in the human consumption food and beverage industry.
 
Europe’s European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (General Food Law Regulation) lays down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the EFSA and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. The basic rule is that no food shall be placed on the market that is unsafe, injurious to health or unfit. Under Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 there are additional food safety regulations based on the HACCP system, and businesses must maintain records of where the raw materials for their products originated. The basic food labeling law is found in Regulations (EU) 1169/2011 and 1924/2006, which set out the information that must be provide to consumers and indicates what can be provide as nutrition and health claims.
 
Member States of the EU also have locally applicable laws and regulations covering aspects of public health, product safety, fair trading and adequate information. Currently, because the products of the Company are sold in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the Company has to comply with those laws in addition to the EU regulations. As the Company sells products in other Member States, it will have to comply with any additional locally applicable laws.

Food that is not compliant with the food safety requirements of the EU or a Member State will be subject to recall for destruction. Retailers and distributors must help with the withdrawal of unsafe food and pass on information necessary to trace it. Consumers and regulators are to be notified about recalled foods. The recall is typically at the expense of the product producer and typically it can be very costly, not only in terms of monetary expense but also in terms of the reputation of a product.
 
While not applicable at this time, should the Company enter the United States market with natural, wholesome better for you food and beverages, it will be governed by the US Food and Drug Administration, and to some extent the United States Department of Agriculture. In addition, state regulation may apply to our products and their distribution. Additionally, in the United States, there is a substantial body of government regulation and case law that will impact what is deemed “natural” and other aspects of the content of our products, product recalls, food safety and labeling.
 
The failure to comply with any of the material provisions of the various applicable laws, regulations and other legal requirements may result in fines, product recalls, or termination of our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Contaminated products may result in product liability claims. The result of these may have an adverse impact on our business reputation and our financial position. We do not believe that any business insurance that we may hold will be adequate to recompense us for our financial damages.
 
Competition
 
The Company has entered the very competitive space of better-for-you food and beverage products. There are a considerable number of competitors comprised of a select few multi-national beverage and food conglomerates and a greater number of upstart independent brands, many limited to specific markets.
 
The multi-nationals with which the Company competes head to head are PepsiCo with their beverage product line Naked distributed broadly in the United States and the European Union, and the Coca Cola Company, with their beverage line Innocent Drinks in the European Union and Odwalla in the United States. The Company’s ability to be swift to respond to market opportunity is a competitive advantage over the slower moving larger corporations. Also, Retailers’ own label beverages are considered as competition. Typically, at a lower price point, the offer is extensive and widely available.
 
The smaller, more nimble competitors in the beverage arena include the UK’s Savsé, Coolbest, grocery retailer private labels brands, and countless start up beverage labels in the UK, Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the near future, the Company expects to expand into the German, Moldavian, French, Swiss, and United States markets, and we will encounter further competition from competitors that are active in those markets. New products are introduced all the time, many of which will be directly competitive to our products or may be competitive on a tangential basis, but in all cases likely diluting our place in the market as a provider of cold-pressed juice and other fruit and vegetable products.
 
We also face competition from local outlets selling smoothie products and other fresh squeezed products. While we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on factors including quality, nutritional integrity, food safety, merchandising, service, sales and distribution, multiple flavors, brand name recognition and loyalty, our products are typically sold at prices higher than most other competing beverage and bar products. Significant competitive pressure from these or other companies could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.
 
In the emerging CBD food, beverage, snacks, health & beauty and animal products categories the competition consists of many small players, all vying for leadership positions. The major food and beverage companies remain on the sidelines with experimental efforts but not full-scale rollouts.
 
Employees
 
On average Natur employed 16.3 employees. As of December 31, 2018, Natur had approximately 14 full time employees. Our employees are mostly engaged in corporate headquarters (11.5) activities and the shop in Amsterdam (2.5). We believe employee relations are generally good. Standard working hours are 40 hours a week.
 
On average, 3.2 full time employees were employed in the shop for 2018. The employees in the shop have a collective bargaining agreement. The employees work on an hourly rate basis, that includes vacation pay, holidays and a defined contribution pension scheme. The store manager has a monthly contract.

Discontinued Operations
 
Future Healthcare of America, prior to becoming known as Natur International Corp. operated primarily in the home healthcare and healthcare staffing services in Wyoming and Montana. As a result of its acquisition of Natur, it has taken steps to discontinue its operations in this area of enterprise. Effective August 31, 2018 it had already closed its offices in Casper, Wyoming As of December 31, 2018, it has terminated all of is staffing services, sold off certain assets, and surrendered its professional servicing licenses. Its current primary activity is to continue to collect outstanding reimbursement claims from various insurance providers and governmental reimbursement organizations, addressing outstanding legal claims and terminating its business operations.
 
As part of the Company’s strategy to operate in a lean and mean manner, the Company decided to centralize all support functions at the headquarters in the Netherlands and to support global account management centrally. For that reason, effective November 30, 2018, the Company closed down the London office. The existing United Kingdom support functions were transferred to the headquarters in Amsterdam as part of the centralization of support staff initiative.
 
Corporate History and Information 
 
Natur was founded to formulate, manufacture and market a premium cold pressed juices product line (under the brand name “Naturalicious” - natural + delicious) and associated natural organic snacks. Natur operates in the Netherlands under the name Natur Holding, B.V.
 
Our parent company was founded on June 22, 2012, as a Wyoming corporation. It recently operated under the name “Future Healthcare of America.” That name was changed on December 28, 2018, when it was re-named “Natur International Corp.”
 
Future Healthcare of America operated two subsidiaries in Wyoming and Montana to provide home health services and nurse staffing in the Western part of the United States. After the share exchange transaction with Natur in November 2018, the parent company commenced the discontinuance of the home healthcare operations and began to take steps to dissolve its subsidiaries and wind up its home healthcare business. Currently, its principal activity is to collect outstanding receivables from the government agencies and insurance companies that insured the recipients of its services, terminate its home healthcare operations and manage a couple of law suits. This termination is close to being completed in April 2019.
  
Natur operated as a private enterprise in the Netherlands from its founding in 2015 through November 13, 2018, when it was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary in a share exchange transaction by Future Healthcare of America on November 13, 2018, contemplated by that certain Share Exchange Agreement, among the Company and the former shareholders of Natur Holding, B.V. (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). In connection with the Share Exchange Transaction, the former shareholders of Natur received the equivalent of 215,759,999 shares of the Common Stock (the “Common Stock”), which was issued in part as 115,760,000 shares of Common Stock and in part as 100,000 shares of voting, convertible Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) representing 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock upon conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock will convert automatically upon the Company increasing the number of shares of Common Stock of its authorized capital, which it plans to do promptly so as to cause the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. Immediately after the Share Exchange Transaction, the former Natur shareholders collectively own the controlling position among the shareholders of the Company.
 
On September 21, 2018, the Company also executed the SPA to issue and sell to Alpha, the selling stockholder, 2,469.131 shares of non-voting, convertible Series A Preferred Stock, each share convertible into approximately 33,000 shares of Common Stock at the rate of $.030303. Alpha also purchased two warrants, one pursuant to the SPA that is exercisable for 33,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $.060606 per share and one pursuant to a debt cancellation agreement exercisable for 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $.15 per share. The aggregate purchase price for the Series A Preferred Stock and the two warrants was $2,000,000 in cash and conversion of approximately $769,000 of principal debt and interest due Alpha from the Company under a prior loan agreement. Alpha also cancelled approximately $651,000 of principal debt and interest due from the Company. These transactions eliminated $1,420,000 of principal debt and interest of the Company. Alpha has also agreed to reimburse up to $100,000 of the liabilities of the Company existing at the closing date. In connection with the SPA, the Company and Alpha also entered into a registration rights agreement providing for the registration of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Stock and upon exercise of the two warrants.
