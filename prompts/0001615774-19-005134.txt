Prior to our acquisitions of WEBA, RS&T and the Dow Assets in December 2016, the Company operated in only one business segment, the Consumer segment. Effective as of January 1, 2017, GlyEco conducted its operation in two business segments: the Consumer segment and the Industrial segment. The Consumer segment’s principal business activity was the production and distribution of ASTM (American Society for Testing Materials) grade glycol products, specifically automotive antifreeze and specialty-blended antifreeze, for sale into the automotive and industrial end markets. The Consumer segment operated a full lifecycle business, picking up waste antifreeze and producing finished antifreeze from both recycled and virgin glycol sources. We operated six processing and distribution centers located in the eastern region of the United States. The production capacity of the Consumer segment was approximately 90,000 gallons per month of ready to use (50/50) antifreeze. On January 11, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the assets of its Consumer segment and now retains only the Industrial division. Operations in our Industrial segment are conducted through WEBA and RS&T, two of our subsidiaries. WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolant and heat transfer industries throughout North America. RS&T operates a glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia that produces virgin quality glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide. The RS&T facility currently produces antifreeze and industrial grade ethylene glycol. The production capacity of the RS&T facility is approximately 1.5 million gallons per month of concentrated ethylene glycol.
 
Industrial Division
 
Our Industrial division consists of two divisions: WEBA, our additives business, and RS&T, our glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia.
 
WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industries throughout North America. We believe WEBA is one of the largest companies serving the North American additive market. WEBA's METALGUARD® additive package product line includes one-step inhibitor systems, which give our customers the ability to easily make various types of antifreeze concentrate and 50/50 coolants for all automobiles, heavy-duty diesel engines, stationary engines in gas patch and other applications. METALGUARD® additive packages cover the entire range of coolant types from basic green conventional to the newest extended life OAT antifreezes of all colors. Our heat transfer fluid additives allow our customers to make finished heat transfer fluids for most industry applications including all-aluminum systems. The METALGUARD® heat transfer fluids include light and heavy-duty fluids, both propylene and ethylene glycol based, for various operating temperatures. These inhibitors cover the industry standard of phosphate-based inhibitors as well as all-organic (OAT) inhibitors for specific pH range and aluminum system requirements.
 
All of the METALGUARD® products are tested at our in-house laboratory facility and by third-party laboratories to assure conformance. We use the standards set by the American Society of Testing Materials (“ASTM”) for all of our products. All of our products pass the most current ASTM standards and testing for each type of product. Our manufacturing facility conforms to the highest levels of process quality control including ISO 9001 certification.
 
RS&T operates a glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia, which produces virgin quality glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide. The RS&T facility currently produces antifreeze and industrial grade ethylene glycol. We believe it is one of the largest glycol re-distillation plants in North America, with production capacity of approximately 1.5 million gallons per month of concentrated ethylene glycol. The facility, located at the Dow Institute Site at Institute, West Virginia, includes five distillation columns, three wiped-film evaporators, heat exchangers, processing and storage tanks, and other processing equipment. The facility’s tanks include feedstock storage capacity of several million gallons and finished goods storage capacity of several million gallons. The plant is equipped with rail and truck unloading/loading facilities, and on-site barge loading/unloading facilities.

Our Strategy
 
We are a vertically integrated specialty chemical company focused on high quality glycol-based products where we can be an efficiency leader, providing value added products as a low-cost manufacturer. To deliver value to all of our stakeholders we: develop and manufacture value-added niche or specialty products which meet or exceed industry standards, provide proactive customer service, effectively manage costs as a low-cost manufacturer, leverage technology and innovation throughout our company.
 
To effectively deliver on our strategy, we offer a broad spectrum of products in our niches, focus on non-standard innovative products, leverage multiple distribution channels and we are market smart in that we maximize less competitive/under-served markets.
 
Our manufacturing operations produce high quality products while effectively managing costs. As a vertically integrated company, we manufacture glycol, develop and manufacture additive technologies, and leverage our position in glycols and additives to manufacture finished downstream products as performance fluids.
 
Our Industry
 
Background on Glycol
 
Glycols are man-made liquid chemicals derived from natural gas and crude oil - non-renewable and limited natural resources. Glycols are used as a base chemical component in industries such as:

1. | Automotive - Glycols are used as antifreeze in vehicles and other equipment with a combustion engine.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | HVAC - Glycols are in the heat transfer fluids used to warm and cool buildings.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Textiles - Glycols are used as a raw material in the manufacturing of polyester fiber and plastics (e.g. water bottles).
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Airline - Glycols are used in aircraft deicing fluid to avoid accumulation of moisture on aircraft wings.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Medical - Glycols are used for equipment sterilization in the medical industry.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are different types of glycol, including propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Through the use of our technology and assets, we generally focus on ethylene glycol but can work with any type of glycol. Ethylene glycol is produced in petrochemical plants using the ethane/ethylene extracted from natural gas or cracked from crude oil in refineries. Ethylene is oxidized in these petrochemical plants to ethylene oxide, which is then hydrated to form ethylene glycol.
 
Glycol and Antifreeze Market
 
World-wide consumption for ethylene glycol is over 5.5 billion gallons per year. China and the United States are the largest consumers of ethylene glycol (“EG”), with the majority of EG being used in polyester and antifreeze applications. While the growth rate of EG consumption has slowed, demand continues to exceed supply for ethylene glycol, largely because of growth in polyester manufacturing used to make clothing, plastic containers, and plastic beverage bottles. The United States consumes approximately 700 million gallons of EG per year, with over 160 million gallons being used in antifreeze applications.

Glycol-Based Standards
 
ASTM, OEM and various states have developed guidelines and regulations that govern the quality of virgin and recycled glycol. ASTM is recognized as the independent leader in creating standards for the composition of antifreeze and other glycol-based products. ASTM sets both performance standards (e.g. specifications for engine coolant used in light- and heavy-duty automobiles) and general purity standards. OEMs set particular standards for the individual needs and preferences for the vehicles/equipment they each manufacture.
 
Competition
 
We compete in the highly fragmented specialty chemicals industry.  We operate in highly competitive markets and face competition in each of our product categories and subcategories. The participants in the industry offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements.  Participants compete with individual and service product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served.  Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability.  Most key competitors are significantly larger than GlyEco and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility.
 
Competitors include glycol manufacturers (e.g. MEGlobal and Huntsman), antifreeze producers (e.g. Shell, Chevron, and Old World), and antifreeze distributors (e.g. Brenntag and Univar Solutions).
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase raw materials, including waste glycol, from multiple sources of supply primarily in the United States.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by seasonal factors, mainly the demand for automotive antifreeze, which can affect our sales volume and the price point. Because the demand for automotive antifreeze is typically higher in winter months, we often see an increase in sales during the first and fourth quarters.
Regulation
 
Although glycol can be considered a hazardous material, there are few federal rules or regulations governing its characterization, transportation, packaging, processing, or disposal (e.g. handling). Typically any regulations that address such activities occur at either the state and/or county level and can vary significantly from region to region.
 
As a handler of glycol, we are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
 
We also conduct interstate motor carrier operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”). The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, but our interstate motor carrier operations are not typically regulated as hazardous materials at this time.

In addition to taking the necessary precautions and maintaining the required permits/licenses, glycol producers generally purchase environmental liability insurance policies to mitigate risks associated with the handling of glycol-based products and other specialty chemicals. We believe we have the appropriate permits, licenses, and insurance policies in place to mitigate risks stemming from the actions of our employees or third parties.
