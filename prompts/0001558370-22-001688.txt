Item 1. Business
Business 
The Company
Trinseo PLC (NYSE: TSE) is a public limited company existing under the laws of Ireland. On October 8, 2021, our former publicly-traded parent entity, Trinseo S.A., was merged with and into Trinseo PLC, with Trinseo PLC as the surviving entity (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was completed pursuant to the Common Draft Terms of Merger dated as of April 23, 2021 and was approved by shareholders at Trinseo S.A.’s 2021 annual general meeting held on June 10, 2021. As a result of the Redomiciliation, all of Trinseo S.A.’s outstanding ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares, were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Trinseo PLC. 
Prior to the formation of Trinseo S.A., our business was wholly owned by The Dow Chemical Company, which, together with its affiliates, we refer to as “Dow,” and we refer to our predecessor business as “the Styron business.” In 2010, the Styron business was sold by Dow to investment funds advised or managed by affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, LP (the “Dow Separation”) and Trinseo S.A. was formed and subsequently began trading on the NYSE in June 2014. In 2016, Bain Capital fully divested its ownership in the Company. 
We are a leading global materials company and manufacturer of plastics and latex binders with a focus on delivering innovative, sustainable, and value-creating products that are intrinsic to our daily lives. We have leading market positions in many of the markets in which we compete. Our products are incorporated into a wide range of our customers’ products throughout the world, including products for automotive applications, consumer electronics, appliances, medical devices, packaging, footwear, carpet, paper and board, building and construction, and wellness, among others. We have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on us for formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find sustainable solutions for their businesses. Many of our products represent only a small portion of a finished product’s manufacturing costs, but provide critical functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to customer specifications. Therefore, we seek to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by our intellectual property portfolio and manufacturing know-how, designed to enhance our customers’ product offerings. We believe these product traits result in substantial customer loyalty. 
We have significant manufacturing and production operations around the world, which allow us to serve our global customer base. As of December 31, 2021, our production facilities included 40 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 81 production units) at 33 sites across 15 countries, including the Company’s joint venture. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we operated 11 research and development (“R&D”) facilities globally, including technology and innovation development centers, which we believe are critical to our global presence and innovation capabilities. Our significant global operations also provide diversity in the end markets for our products.

Our Strategy
In 2021, we continued to focus our efforts and investments on a strategy to transform Trinseo into a specialty materials and sustainable solutions provider focusing on product offerings which are less cyclical and offer significantly higher growth and margin potential. In pursuit of this transformational goal, we have invested, and will continue to invest, in product offerings serving the applications within our Engineered Materials business segment, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (“CASE”) applications within the Latex Binders business segment. 
In furtherance of this strategy, in 2021, we completed two significant acquisitions to grow our Engineered Materials business segment. In May of 2021, we closed the acquisition of the polymethyl methacrylates (“PMMA”) and activated methyl methacrylates (“MMA”) businesses (together, referred to herein as the “PMMA business”) from Arkema S.A. for a purchase price of $1,364.9 million (the “PMMA Acquisition”). PMMA is a transparent and rigid plastic with a wide range of end uses that complements Trinseo’s existing offerings across several end markets including automotive, building & construction, medical and consumer electronics. In September 2021, we closed the acquisition of Aristech Surfaces LLC (“Aristech Surfaces”), a leading North America manufacturer and global provider of PMMA continuous cast and solid surface sheets, serving the wellness, architectural, transportation and industrial markets, for a purchase price of $449.5 million (the “Aristech Surfaces Acquisition”). In December 2021, we also completed the sale of our synthetic rubber business to Synthos S.A., for an enterprise value of approximately $491.0 million. Finally, in November 2021 we announced our intention to explore the divestiture of our styrenics businesses, which includes our Feedstocks, Polystyrene, and Americas Styrenics reporting segments, for which we launched a formal sales process in January 2022. Each of these steps is part of a series of strategic actions to transform the Company into a higher growth, higher margin and less cyclical specialty and sustainable materials provider.
We believe that there are still significant opportunities to improve our business and enhance our position as a specialty materials and sustainable solutions provider by continuing to enhance our existing portfolio, and by expanding on the businesses acquired in 2021. In addition to our transformation strategy, the Company continues to seek organic growth through expansion into key markets or strategic capital investments targeting technologies and solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers, and to continue to provide innovative products to our customers who seek our technological and development capabilities to create specialty grades, new and sustainable products, and technologically-differentiated formulations. The Company will continue to focus on growing margins and reducing earnings volatility through such organic investments, strategic acquisitions or investments, as well as divestitures of businesses less suitable to our portfolio. The strategic acquisitions and investments that we have pursued have attractive risk-adjusted returns in markets and geographies that we believe have the best opportunity for growth as well as opportunity for cost-saving synergies. 
We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. The Company employs a disciplined approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash that strives to balance the growth of our business, funding for targeted acquisitions, and continued cash generation, while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. Notably, in the third quarter of 2021, the Company increased our quarterly dividend from $0.08 per share to $0.32 per share. Further, in December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $200.0 

6



million share repurchase program covering an 18 month period, of which shares with a total value of $50.0 million were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
The priorities for uses of available cash include the servicing of our debt, the funding of targeted growth initiatives, and the continued return of capital to our shareholders via quarterly dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares, when deemed appropriate. Management believes that strong cash flow generation, continued profitability, and spending discipline are critical to providing the Company with the ongoing flexibility to pursue our business strategy.
For more information regarding our strategic highlights see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2021 Highlights.
Business Segments
Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, the Company reported the results of the Synthetic Rubber business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented, and therefore it is no longer presented as a separate reportable segment. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the classification of the Synthetic Rubber business as discontinued operations, and the related impacts on our other segment results due to this classification.

Engineered Materials Segment 
Overview
Our Engineered Materials segment consists of rigid thermoplastic compounds and blends products, soft thermoplastic products, continuous cast PMMA sheet products from the Aristech Surfaces Acquisition and PMMA resins and sheets (extruded and cell-cast) from the PMMA Acquisition. Products in this segment are primarily targeted toward higher growth and higher margin applications primarily in consumer electronics, medical, footwear, automotive and building & construction. The PMMA business also includes production of MMA in Europe primarily for our own consumption in producing PMMA with the remainder sold into the merchant market. 
In 2021, approximately 39% of total Engineered Materials net sales were generated in Europe, approximately 40% were generated in the United States, and approximately 20% were generated in Asia.
Products and End Uses 
Products in the Engineered Materials segment are split into rigid compounds, soft plastic compounds, and PMMA resins and sheets. Rigid compounds include polycarbonate (“PC”) compounds, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (“ABS”) compounds, and PC blends, mostly PC/ABS, and support primarily the consumer electronics and medical markets for equipment housing applications. Thermoplastic elastomer (“TPE”) soft plastic compounds are focused on supporting footwear shoe sole applications, personal care, consumer electronics, and automotive high-end applications such as overmolds, sealings, tubing, and films. PMMA products can be sold as resin compounds or sheets produced through continuous-cast, extrusion, and cell-cast processes. PMMA products are sold primarily into building & construction, automotive, medical and consumer goods applications.
The benefit of Trinseo’s portfolio in our Engineered Materials segment is the high level of customization for high-end applications at selected premium brand owners, and clear orientation to sustainable solutions. Our current portfolio includes sustainable solutions, such as high-content post-consumer recycled (“PCR”) polycarbonate and bio-based raw materials. We are developing further solutions to expand our sustainable offering using PCR ABS and PCR TPE. Sustainable products represented 7% of Engineered Materials segment volume in 2021 and are a core growth area.
We sell our rigid compounds products mainly under the EMERGE brand for consumer electronics, and under the CALIBRE brand for medical markets. We sell our PMMA products primarily under PLEXIGLAS in the United States and ALTUGLAS in Europe and Asia. We foresee growth and robust demand in applications of building & construction, 

7



consumer goods, and especially automotive following constrained production during 2021 as well as continued initiatives toward light-weighting and digitization. Supported by current macro trends, specifically as it relates to safety and health, remote servicing and working, and sustainability, we believe that we have additional growth opportunities in existing consumer electronics applications, including tablets, notebooks, smart phones and other handheld devices, as well as new voice control systems, home entertainment and delivery equipment. We also foresee growth in medical wearables, home equipment, and drug delivery devices. In serving these markets, we leverage our polymer and compound technologies to meet increasingly stringent performance requirements along with our customers’ aesthetic and color-matching requirements, which are crucial characteristics for the products involved.
We sell the products in our portfolio from the Aristech Surfaces Acquisition primarily under the trade names ACRYSPA, AVONITE and STUDIO. We foresee growth in wellness applications such as hot tubs and swim spas as well as sanitary applications like bathtubs. We are able to effectively serve these markets through our specialized continuous cast sheet production capabilities that allow us to provide large scale PMMA sheet with specific color requirements. We have also expanded our product offerings into transportation applications and continue to provide customer solutions in architectural applications such as counter-tops. 
We manufacture our TPE soft plastic compounds principally under the trade names MEGOL, APILON, APIGO, and APINAT. Growth in footwear is supported by bio solutions in both luxury and sport premium markets, while automotive growth is orientated to hygienic interiors and both robust and smart surfaces.

Seasonality
Due to the steady demand state of a portfolio of applications in many markets, such as consumer electronics, medical devices, and footwear, rigid compounds and soft TPE products do not experience significant seasonality. PMMA applications do experience some seasonality due to exposure to automotive and building and construction markets.
Latex Binders Segment 
Overview 
We are a global leader in styrene-butadiene latex (“SB latex”), holding a strong market position across the geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #2 position in SB latex capacity in Europe and the #1 position in capacity in North America, based on third party data. In 2021, approximately 48% of our Latex Binders segment’s sales were generated in Europe, 27% were generated in the United States, and the majority of the remaining net sales were generated in Asia. Additionally, this segment includes the results of our styrene-acrylate latex (“SA latex”) production facilities and related infrastructure in the United States, Europe and Asia. As noted above, as part of the Company’s transformational strategy, our key area of focus in the Latex Binders segment is to grow our product offerings serving CASE applications, as these offer significantly higher growth and margin potential.
Products and End Uses 
We hold the #1 position for supplying latex binders for the coated paper and board market globally. SB latex is widely used as a binder for mineral pigments as it allows high coating speeds, improved smoothness, higher gloss level, 

8



opacity and water resistance that is valued in the product’s end use in advertising, magazines, and packaging board coatings.
We are also the #1 supplier of latex binders to the carpet and artificial turf market and offer a diverse range of products for use in residential and commercial applications. We produce SB latex, SA latex, vinylidene chloride, and butadiene-methacrylate latex products for the commercial and niche carpet markets. SB latex is also used in flooring as an adhesive for carpet and artificial turf fibers. We continue to implement new chemistries for paper coating and carpet backing applications. 
We also offer a broad range of performance latex binders products, including SB latex, SA latex, and vinylidene chloride latex for CASE applications. Net sales to CASE applications made up approximately 14% of total Latex Binders net sales in 2021, with margins of approximately two times the average of products serving all applications within the segment.
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Latex Binders segment include BASF Group and Synthomer plc. In this segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service, and the length and depth of our relationships. This industry has seen capacity reduction and consolidation which we believe could positively impact our competitive standing.
We believe our Latex Binders segment is able to differentiate itself by offering customers value-added formulations and product development expertise. Our R&D team and Technical Services and Development (“TS&D”) team are able to use our pilot coating facility, paper fabrication and testing labs, carpet technology centers located near carpet producers, and product development and process research centers to assist customers in designing new products and enhancing their manufacturing processes. Many of our major customers rely on our dedicated R&D and TS&D teams to complement their limited in-house resources for formulation and reformulation tests and trials. We believe that this capability allows us to capture new business, strengthen our existing customer relationships and broaden our technological expertise. 
Additionally, our global manufacturing footprint is key in allowing us to serve our customers in a cost-effective manner, as latex binders products are costly to ship over long distances due to their high water content. We believe that our global network of service and manufacturing facilities is highly valued by our customers. We seek to capture the value of our R&D and TS&D services and manufacturing capabilities through our pricing strategy. In 2021, we estimate that more than half of net sales in this segment related to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
Seasonality
Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance, particularly in the CASE applications of our Latex Binders segment.
Base Plastics Segment 
Overview
Our Base Plastics segment consists of a variety of compounds and blends, the majority of which are for automotive applications. The segment also includes our ABS, styrene-acrylonitrile (“SAN”), and PC businesses. In 2021, approximately 63% of net sales from our Base Plastics segment were generated in Europe, 20% were generated in the United States, and 12% were generated in Asia.
Products and End Uses
Copolymers. Our copolymers products consist of ABS and SAN. In 2021, copolymers represented approximately 61% of total segment net sales. 
We are a leading producer of ABS in Europe and are one of the few global producers, with additional presence in both North America and China. We produce mass ABS (“mABS”), a variation of ABS that has lower conversion and capital costs compared to the more common emulsion ABS (“eABS”) process, marketed under our MAGNUM brand. 

9



mABS has similar properties to eABS but has greater colorability, thermal stability and lower gloss. mABS products can be manufactured to stricter specifications because they are produced in a continuous process as opposed to the batch process used in eABS. mABS also has environmental benefits such as waste reduction and higher yields. In addition to our own mABS production capacity, we have licensed our proprietary mABS technology to other producers.
Primary end uses for our ABS products include automotive and construction sheet applications. We maintain a significant share of ABS sales into these markets, which we believe is due to the differentiating attributes of our mABS products, our reputation as a knowledgeable and reliable supplier, our broad product mix, and our customer collaboration, including design capabilities.
SAN is composed of styrene and acrylonitrile, which together provide clarity, stiffness, an enhanced ability to be processed, mechanical strength, barrier properties, chemical resistance and heat resistance. SAN is used mainly in appliances, consumer goods and construction sheets, due to its low cost, clarity and chemical resistance properties.
PC. Our PC products are manufactured in Stade, Germany and are sold into various markets as well as consumed internally for our compounding products. In 2021, PC represented approximately 16% of total segment net sales.
PC has high levels of clarity, impact resistance and temperature resistance. PC can be used in its neat form (prior to any compounding or blending) for markets such as construction sheet, medical and LED lighting. Additionally, PC can be compounded or blended with other polymers, such as ABS, which imparts specific performance attributes tailored to the product’s end use. 
Our products for glazing and construction sheets are marketed under the CALIBRE brand name and offer customers a combination of clarity, heat resistance and impact performance. Glazing and construction sheet represents our largest PC application and one of the key end markets is the construction industry. 
Compounding. Our compounding products consist of PC/ABS compounds, PC blends, and PC and polypropylene blends. In 2021, compounding products represented approximately 23% of total segment net sales.
We have a significant position in PC/ABS blends, which combine the heat resistance and impact strength of PC with the easy-to-process qualities and resilience of ABS. We have also developed compounds containing PCR content in their products. We believe our ability to offer technologically-differentiated products to meet customer needs sets us apart from our competitors, and with our history as a leading innovator in compounds and blends, we have established ourselves as a leading supplier of PC-based products. 
For the automotive industry, we manufacture PC/ABS blends under the PULSE brand, and we innovate collaboratively with our customers to develop performance solutions to meet industry needs, such as reducing the weight of vehicles or providing products using recycled or sustainable content. As a result, we are a key supplier of these products to leading automotive companies in North America and Europe, who tend to specify these products on a per car platform basis, making it difficult to be displaced as a supplier once selected and providing us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows for several years during the production lifecycle. We have an established position in China and are working to further increase our presence in this important market.
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Base Plastics segment are Covestro AG, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, INEOS Styrolution, Versalis, Shanghai Kumho Sunny Plastics Co., Ltd., Shanghai Pret Composites Co. Ltd., and Lotte Chemical Corporation. In our Base Plastics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our customer relationships.
We believe potential growth in the Base Plastics segment will be impacted by a number of factors, including consumer preference for lighter-weight and impact-resistant products. Additionally, we believe growth prospects are bolstered by sustainability trends and potential government mandates, such as the substitution of lighter-weight plastics for metal in automobiles. Therefore, we believe our history of innovation and our focus on differentiated products enhances our growth prospects in this segment. Our innovation has contributed to long-standing relationships with customers who are recognized leaders in their respective end markets. We also believe our global facilities are a 

10



competitive advantage that allows us to provide customers with consistent grades across different regions, and positions us to strategically serve emerging markets.
Seasonality
Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Base Plastics segment.
Polystyrene Segment
Overview 
We are a leading producer of polystyrene and focus on sales to injection molding and thermoforming customers. In 2021, approximately 62% of net sales from our Polystyrene segment were generated in Europe and 38% of net sales were generated in Asia.
Products and End Uses 
Our product offerings include a variety of general purpose polystyrenes (“GPPS”) and high impact polystyrene (“HIPS”). HIPS is polystyrene that has been modified with polybutadiene rubber to increase its impact resistant properties. These products provide customers with performance and aesthetics at a low cost across applications, including appliances, packaging, including food packaging and food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials.
The STYRON™ brand is one of the longest established brands in the industry and is widely recognized in the global marketplace. We believe our R&D capabilities provide valuable, differentiated solutions for our customers, making us well-positioned to address the sustainability, weight reduction, and safety needs.
In 2021 we began offering recycled polystyrene for food packaging applications for some of our customers. We view recycled polystyrene products as important not only for the benefit of the environment but also as a way to better serve our customers by addressing their need for sustainable solutions. 
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Polystyrene segment are INEOS Styrolution, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., Sinopec Corp., Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp., and Chi Mei Corporation. In this segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer reliable and innovative products as well as the quality of our customer service, operational reliability and the length and depth of our relationships. 
Our customer-centric model focuses on understanding customers’ needs and developing tailored relationships that add value beyond the value of the actual product performance. For durable applications, we focus our efforts on product design engineering initiatives for developing and specifying plastics in the next generation of construction applications and appliances. In non-durable applications, we focus on innovative products that provide clear cost advantages to our customers, serving customers with our cost-advantaged technology and operating excellence. We are also able to offer various sustainable product innovations in our non-durable applications, especially packaging. We have leveraged industry-leading product development and technology capabilities in many of our product lines in this segment to develop long-standing customer relationships, including with a number of customers who have purchased from us, including our predecessor business operated by Dow for more than 20 years. We believe that our asset footprint is an advantage, allowing us to provide customers with consistent product grades and positioning us to strategically serve growth economies. 
​
Seasonality
Due to the geographic diversity of the Company’s customers and end markets for our polystyrene products across the globe, our Polystyrene segment does not typically experience material levels of seasonality. However, sales volumes may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as customers may adjust their purchasing patterns based on their expectations of polystyrene price changes. 

11



Feedstocks Segment
Overview
Trinseo is a large consumer of styrene monomer globally. The primary function of our Feedstocks segment is the production of styrene monomer in Europe in order to provide secure sourcing of this key raw material to our other segments. In fact, the majority of the styrene monomer produced by our Feedstocks segment is consumed by our other segments. However, we do sell a portion of our produced styrene monomer to third parties. Overall, our Feedstocks segment supplied 15% of the West European styrene monomer capacity in 2021.
Products and End Uses
Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SAN resins, SA latex, SB latex, ABS resins, and unsaturated polyethylene resins. 
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Feedstocks segment are: INEOS Styrolution, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., BASF SE, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, LyondellBasell, Repsol PLC, and Royal Dutch Shell plc. The majority of styrene monomer produced within the Feedstocks segment is consumed by the Company in our own manufacturing activities.
Global styrene operating rate percentages were around 80% in 2021 but we believe operating rates will drop to the high 70% range and remain at similar levels over the next several years. The operating rate could be positively impacted by the potential closure of higher-cost styrene plants. Effective operating rates can, from time to time, be impacted by planned and unplanned outages, leading to periods of elevated margins.
Seasonality
Our Feedstocks segment does not generally experience material levels of seasonality affecting sales volumes; however, there may be seasonal fluctuations in margin as planned supply outages generally occur more often in the spring and fall seasons.
Americas Styrenics Segment
Overview 
This segment consists solely of the operations of our 50%-owned joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Americas Styrenics LLC (“Americas Styrenics”), which continues to be a leading producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. In 2021, Americas Styrenics was the #1 producer of polystyrene, based on capacity data, and supplied 18% of the styrene monomer capacity in North America. We received a total of $85.0 million in cash dividends from Americas Styrenics during 2021. We estimate that the contribution to our equity earnings from Americas Styrenics’ polystyrene business was approximately 72% in 2021, 75% in 2020, and 49% in 2019. 
Products and End Uses
Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, and in 2021 approximately 59% of the styrene monomer produced by Americas Styrenics was consumed in its own production of polystyrene. The remainder of Americas Styrenics’ product is sold as a key raw material to other manufacturers of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber. 
Americas Styrenics also produces GPPS, high heat, high impact resin, and STYRON A-TECH™ polystyrene products. Major applications for these polystyrene products include appliances, food packaging, food service disposables, consumer electronics, and building and construction materials.

12

Americas Styrenics’ principal competitors are INEOS Styrolution, Total S.p.A., and LyondellBasell. In our Americas Styrenics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer reliable products as well as the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships.
As a leading styrenics producer in North America, this segment is well-positioned to benefit from consolidation dynamics in the styrene and polystyrene industries within the region. As noted above in the Feedstocks segment section, global styrene operating rate percentages were around 80% in 2021 and we believe they will drop to the high 70% range over the next several years, with the potential for positive upside if there are closures of higher-cost styrene plants. Effective operating rates can, from time to time, be impacted by planned and unplanned outages, leading to periods of elevated margins. 
Seasonality
 Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Americas Styrenics segment.
Our Relationship with Dow 
Following the Dow Separation, we entered into certain long-term agreements with Dow to provide services that would ease our transition into a standalone company. In recent years, the Company has successfully migrated a substantial level of systems and services support away from Dow. However, we continue to maintain a significant relationship with Dow for certain technology and site services, as well as the supply of certain key raw materials. The failure of Dow to perform their obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A—Risk Factors for more information.
We are party to various site services agreements (“SAR SSAs”) for Dow to provide site services to the Company at Dow-owned sites. Conversely, we entered into similar agreements with Dow, where, at Company-owned sites, we provide such services to Dow. These agreements cover general services that are provided at certain facilities co-located with Dow, including utilities, site administration, environmental health and safety, site maintenance and supply chain. These agreements generally have 25-year terms and include options to renew. These agreements may be terminated at any time by agreement of the parties, or, by either party, for cause or under certain circumstances for a material breach. In addition, we may terminate with 12-months’ prior notice to Dow any services identified in any SAR SSA as “terminable.” Highly integrated services, such as electricity and steam, generally cannot be terminated prior to the termination date unless we experience a production unit shut down for which we provide Dow with 15-months’ prior notice, or upon payment of a shutdown fee. Upon expiration or termination, we would be obligated to pay a monthly fee to Dow for a period of 45 to 60 months following the expiration or termination of such SAR SSA. The agreements under which Dow receives services from us may be terminated under the same circumstances and conditions.
Additionally, we are party to several agreements with Dow for the provision of certain raw materials, products and services and other operational arrangements. Dow provides a large percentage of certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. In connection with the PMMA Acquisition, the Company assumed a Capacity Reservation Contract (“CRC”) which is an evergreen contract that provides guaranteed access to a certain portion of MMA capacity at a Dow-owned manufacturing facility in North America. See Sources and Availability of Raw Materials for more information.
Under the Amended and Restated MOD5 Computerized Process Control Software, Licenses and Services Agreement, with Rofan Services (“AR MOD5 Agreement”), Dow provides worldwide process control technology, including hardware, software licenses and support services, and related enterprise resource planning services. The AR MOD5 Agreement has a term through December 2023 and may be terminated by either party for cause or uncured material breach; by Trinseo if we no longer wish to receive maintenance and support for any licensed software; or by Dow if we use the licensed software for any purposes other than Company business. Dow may terminate the maintenance and support terms at any time if we fail to make payments when due. With the exception of three sites, as of December 31, 2021, we have converted all plant locations from this MOD5 process control technology and are no longer reliant on Dow for this service. We expect to convert the remaining sites by the end of 2023.

13



The Second Amended and Restated Master Outsourcing Services Agreement (“SAR MOSA”) provides for ongoing worldwide services, substantially all of which were no longer provided by Dow as of December 31, 2020, following our transition of these services over the last several years. The Company did not incur significant costs related for the SAR MOSA in 2021, nor do we expect to incur any further costs going forward. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we incurred a total of $217.7 million, $117.5 million, and $163.6 million, respectively, in expenses under the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and SAR SSAs (which include utilities), including $210.3 million, $101.3 million, and $123.7 million, respectively, for both the variable and fixed cost components of the site services agreements and $7.4 million, $16.2 million, and $39.8 million, respectively, covering all other agreements. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, purchases and other charges from Dow and its affiliated companies (excluding the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and SAR SSAs) were approximately $1,141.0 million, $659.5 million, and $781.9 million, respectively. These purchases and other charges primarily relate to the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing our products. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, sales to Dow and its affiliated companies were approximately $156.4 million, $98.4 million, and $80.0 million, respectively. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
The prices of our key raw materials are volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time. While the predominant reason for this volatility is the impact of market imbalances in supply and demand from time to time, energy prices, transportation costs and supplier force majeures may also impact the volatility of some of our raw materials. The table below shows our key raw materials by reporting segment.

We have supply contracts in place to help maintain our supply of raw materials at competitive market prices and seek to implement the most efficient and reliable raw material strategy for each of our segments, including maintaining a balance between contracted and spot purchases of raw materials. We also produce raw materials for use by our businesses, such as styrene monomer and MMA, and we purchase PCR materials for use in products such as our PC compounds. 
In 2021, we obtained approximately 22% of our raw materials from Dow (based on aggregate purchase price). In 2021, Dow supplied us with approximately 77% of our benzene requirements and 100% of our ethylene requirements. Dow continues to be our largest supplier for these raw materials as well as a significant supplier of butadiene. Our current supply agreements with Dow for ethylene, benzene, and butadiene commenced in 2021 and have contractual terms of two to five years, with renewal provisions. PMMA products use MMA as the key raw material, which is sourced through both our own production in Europe and through supply agreements. During 2021, Dow has supplied us with an aggregate 46% of the MMA used in our PMMA production, both in the United States under the CRC, as well as through other unrelated supply agreements. 
While Dow provides a significant portion of our raw materials pursuant to these supply agreements, we have developed a comprehensive strategy for obtaining additional sources of supply where needed. Other supply sources in Europe include major producers with contract terms of up to five years at competitive market prices. Supply of benzene 

14



and ethylene to North America and Asia are exclusively from other diversified sets of major third-party producers via supply contracts. We rely primarily on the CRC for a majority of our MMA needs in the United States, but can source MMA from other manufacturers in the North America and Europe, as well as from our own production. In 2021, our manufacturing sites provided approximately 43% of our MMA supply. We source raw materials for our MMA production (acetone and ammonia) primarily from two suppliers in Italy.
In 2021 we obtained 53% of our styrene supply through long-term strategic contracts and spot market purchases. Additionally, our internal production of styrene from purchased ethylene and benzene at our own manufacturing sites provided 47% of our styrene supply in 2021. With this mix of purchased and produced styrene, we seek to optimize our overall costs of securing styrene through efficient logistics, manufacturing economics and market dynamics. 
Bisphenol A (“BPA”) is the major raw material associated with PC production. Our supply of this raw material is produced by a subsidiary of Olin Corporation and is provided via pipeline to us through a supply contract with a term through December 31, 2022. Acetone is a key material for producing MMA and we are supplied with acetone via long term agreements with Versalis in Europe.
Technology 
Our R&D and TS&D activities across our segments focus on identifying needs in our customers’ end markets. As part of our customer-centric model, our R&D/TS&D organization interfaces with our sales and marketing teams and directly with customers to determine their product requirements, considering industry and market segment trends. This information is used to select R&D/TS&D projects that are value-enhancing for both our customers and Trinseo. 
Our innovation and technology centers support our technological and R&D/TS&D capabilities. In addition, our R&D/TS&D efforts are also supported by certain “mini-plants” operated by our businesses in Stade. These mini plants are used to make samples of experimental products for testing, which we believe is a critical step in our new product development process. We also operate a plastics research center, which integrates two existing technical support centers and research lab operations in a single location at our Terneuzen, The Netherlands office location. Further, we operate pilot plants to facilitate new production technology, including a TPE pilot facility in Hsinchu, Taiwan which enables close collaboration with Asia Pacific customers for sustainably advantaged materials in targeted markets including consumer electronics, medical, footwear, and automotive. Finally, two R&D centers in Europe and one in the United States, acquired in the PMMA Acquisition, and R&D centers at our Aristech Surfaces locations in the United States, are responsible for the design of PMMA products at the Company’s seven global PMMA manufacturing plants.
R&D and TS&D costs are included in expenses as incurred. Our R&D and TS&D costs were $63.9 million, $42.6 million, and $38.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
We have a customer-centric business model that has helped us to develop strong relationships with many customers. Our sales and marketing professionals are primarily located at our facilities or at virtual offices within their respective geographies. We have approximately 192 professionals working in sales and marketing around the world, along with approximately 95 customer service professionals and we sell our products to customers in approximately 80 countries. We primarily market our products through our direct sales force. Typically, our direct sales are made by our employees in the regions closest to the given customer.
Intellectual Property 
We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to utilize patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions, while maintaining other inventions as trade secrets, derived from our customer-centric business model, to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities. Our policy is to seek appropriate protection for significant product and process developments in the major markets where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from 

15



country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent. The intellectual property that we have created or acquired since our formation covers areas such as material formulations, material process technologies and various end-use industrial applications.
In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. These information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors’ products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
The technologies we utilize in some of our businesses have been in use for many years (e.g., SB latex and ABS) and a number of our patents relating to such technologies have expired or will expire within the next several years. Additionally, certain patents acquired in the PMMA Acquisition or the Aristech Surfaces Acquisition are expected to expire in the next several years. As patents expire, or are allowed to lapse, the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public. We believe that the expiration of any single patent or family of patents that is scheduled to expire in the next three years would not materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We believe that our trade secrets relating to manufacturing and other processes used in connection with products to which expiring patents relate will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage after the expiration of these patents.
We use trademarks as a means of differentiating our products. We protect our trademarks against infringement where we deem appropriate. We have successfully registered the TRINSEO™ trademark in more than 130 countries, and acquired the Plexiglas®, Altuglas®, Solarkote® and Oroglas® marks as well as other trademarks in the PMMA Acquisition.
Dow has either transferred to us or granted perpetual, royalty-free licenses to us to use Dow’s intellectual property that was used by Dow to operate the Styron business prior to the Dow Separation. This intellectual property includes certain processes, compositions and apparatus used in the manufacture of our products. In addition to our license rights to use Dow’s intellectual property related to the Styron business, we have obtained licenses to use Dow’s intellectual property to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under the contracts transferred to us in the Dow Separation and to use such intellectual property (other than patents) for products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Dow Separation, subject to certain limitations. While we believe our license rights with respect to Dow’s intellectual property are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex binders, and to a lesser extent plastics, involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be impacted by intellectual property rights that have not been licensed to us by Dow. We have the right, with Dow’s cooperation, to directly enforce the patents that are exclusively licensed to us by Dow where infringement is primarily within the scope of our business; but nothing obligates Dow to enforce against third parties the intellectual property rights of Dow that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis or where the infringement is primarily outside the scope of our business.

Environmental, Health, Safety and Product Stewardship 
Obtaining, producing and distributing many of our products involve the use, storage, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, which address, among other things:


● | emissions to the air;
--+----------------------


● | discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | other releases into the environment;
--+-------------------------------------


● | prevention, remediation or abatement of releases of hazardous materials into the indoor or outdoor environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | climate change impacts;
--+------------------------


● | process and maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | registration and evaluation of chemicals;
--+------------------------------------------


● | production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | stewardship of products after manufacture; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | circular solutions, for polystyrene and other products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

We monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international environmental, health and safety requirements and maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, which may in some circumstances exceed the requirements imposed by applicable law. We have a strong environmental, health and safety organization with a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental, health, safety and product regulatory compliance and stewardship, in addition to comprehensive standards and tools. We supplement our programs with our participation in trade associations which monitor developments in legislation impacting our businesses. Additionally, our Supplier Code of Conduct includes our expectations for our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and encourages them to adhere to the highest principles of environmental responsibility.
We follow the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care® Guiding Principles for our global facilities and products and have received third party certification of our Responsible Care® Management System. Many of our facilities have been certified to ISO 14001 and other ISO management systems. We have a mature corporate environmental, health and safety audit program for all of our facilities. We focus on emergency preparedness, crisis planning and drills, at both the facility and corporate level. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general.
Sustainability and Climate Change
We recognize that climate change has had and will continue to have significant impacts on our environment, particularly as it relates to extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels, and which has prompted regulations limiting, among other things, the emission of greenhouse gases. In the countries in which we operate, particularly in the EU, we are required to comply with increasingly extensive regulations to address climate change impacts and resource conservation requirements. We also monitor legislative actions and their potential impacts on the end markets we serve.
We track and publicly report our greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, waste, and energy consumptions and our facilities work to improve our performance at reducing chemical emissions, water usage and energy consumption. Our Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Report (the “Sustainability Report”), which is available on our website, provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products, performance and operations. The report highlights sustainability goals and other initiatives to improve our sustainability performance. We do not expect the costs to comply with legislation enacted as a result of climate change and other sustainability efforts will be material to our operations and consolidated financial position in the next 12 months.
Sustainability is a key focus area of our long-term strategy and during 2021 we continued to take actions to further our offering of sustainable products, including the commencement of sales of polystyrene products for food contact applications. We also took action to increase our access to recycled feedstocks through both our announced collaboration with BASF to increase styrene production from circular feedstocks and the announced acquisition of plastics collector and recycler Heathland B.V. (“Heathland”), which closed in January 2022. In addition, we achieved ISCC certification 

17



for Mass Balance processes for polystyrene manufactured at our Tessenderlo, Belgium plant, as well as for PC produced in Stade, Germany, and styrene manufactured in Terneuzen, The Netherlands. We also supplemented an already strong annual Sustainability Report with the incorporation of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) framework. These achievements were accomplished while maintaining our high standard for safety and Employee Health & Safety (“EH&S”) excellence. We expect the costs of administering our sustainability program to increase as we continue to focus and improve our sustainability initiatives.
Environmental Remediation
Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. At our Allyn’s Point, Connecticut property we lease a portion of the property to our joint venture, Americas Styrenics, for its operations, which includes a regulated hazardous waste boiler, for which potential liabilities are addressed through financial assurance mechanisms and other agreements. Many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of the sites and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Subject to certain monetary and temporal limitations, Dow is obligated to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to releases of hazardous material that existed at our sites prior to the Dow Separation. The period for new claims at these sites has expired. Later-acquired sites are subject to a different limitations period. We cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor their existing indemnity obligations or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. Other than certain immaterial environmental liabilities assumed as part of the PMMA Acquisition and the Aristech Surfaces Acquisition, no environmental claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. Any active remedial projects on our properties which were part of the Dow Separation are being performed by Dow pursuant to its indemnification obligations. Other than certain immaterial environmental liabilities assumed as part of the PMMA Acquisition and the Aristech Surfaces Acquisition, no environmental claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company, and the Company is not a potentially responsible party for any material amounts at any Superfund Sites. We conduct comprehensive environmental due diligence for potential acquisitions to mitigate the risk of assuming obligations to conduct material levels of environmental remediation.
Board Oversight
The Environmental, Health, Safety, Sustainability and Public Policy Committee (the “EHSS&PP Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors was established in 2014 to assist the Board with oversight of Company programs, policies and initiatives that support the environment, health and safety, sustainability, corporate social responsibility and climate change. The EHSS&PP Committee is responsible for supporting alignment between the Company and the Board on the Company’s sustainability, social, and public policy goals; guiding the Company and overseeing management of risks arising from our sustainability programs, policies, partnerships, activities and goals; reviewing external public policy/governmental affairs issues and trends, and recommending Company response to these issues. The EHSS&PP Committee also reviews the Company’s annual Sustainability Report for Board approval and publication on the Company’s website.
Government Regulation
In addition to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, our operations subject us to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. International trade laws and trade agreements, export and customs controls can limit the countries in which we can do business, or add significant cost to the import or export of our products or raw materials. Changes to or violations of these regulations could impact the costs of our goods or cause delay in shipments. Our products are also used in a variety of end-uses that have specific regulatory or consumer safety requirements such as those relating to food packaging or medical devices. Changes in these requirements could result in increased compliance costs, product recalls, or fines, which could prevent or inhibit the development and sale of our products. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government regulations can affect the Company’s global 

18



operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Security 
We recognize the importance of security and safety to our employees and the community. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of technology) and emergency response preparedness into integrated security plans. We have conducted information security assessments at our operating facilities worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber-attacks. Effort and resources in assessing security requirements at our manufacturing facilities will continue, as required by U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other requirements.
Trinseo has implemented information security solutions, resources, policies, programs, and monitoring alerts to respond to potential information security events and to maintain compliance with the increasing amount of data privacy laws and regulation. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of security risks, measures and incidents, with input from members of management and our information security team. 
Human Capital Resources and Objectives
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,100 employees worldwide, with the majority (approximately 60%) located in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East and Africa), approximately 16% in Asia Pacific, and the remainder in the Americas. We increased the size of our workforce through the acquisitions of the PMMA business and Aristech Surfaces, partially offset by employees transferred to Synthos S.A. as part of the sale of our Synthetic Rubber business. Approximately 97% of our workforce is full-time.
Nearly 70% of our personnel are located at the various manufacturing sites, research and development, pilot coating, paper fabrication and testing and technology centers. The remaining employees are located at operating centers, virtual locations or geographically dispersed marketing and sales locations. Our facilities in Midland, Michigan, Bristol, Pennsylvania, and Louisville, Kentucky, and our facility in Matamoros, Mexico have union representation, while employees at certain of our other locations are represented by work councils. We believe we maintain good relations with our personnel and various labor organizations. There have been no labor strikes or work stoppages in these locations in recent history.
​
People Strategy
We strive to retain a talented, diverse and inclusive workforce and understand that our success requires ongoing investment in our employees. Our approach to attracting and retaining talent is our commitment to our core values of Responsible Care®, Innovation, Respect & Integrity, Accountability & Value Creation, and Commitment to Customers. As applied to our employees, these values prioritize health and safety, accountability and rewards for achievement, and treatment of all persons in our organization with respect, honesty, and dignity.
Our core values are reflected in the goals of our “People Strategy,” which is designed to support employees through Talent Management, Organizational Development, and Recognition & Rewards. Talent Management measures our ability to attract and select the right talent for the right roles, onboard new employees to improve integration, build critical capabilities, and develop leaders of the future, with a culture of collaboration among high-performing and diverse teams. Organizational Development focuses on the design of organization models to achieve our business strategies, assess employee engagement, evolve our culture and facilitate open communication. Recognition & Rewards means our efforts to manage, measure, and pay for performance; differentiate and recognize job growth with increases, promotions, and pay, annual performance awards and recognition of outstanding contributions from employees.
​
Environmental Protection and Employee Health & Safety 
Focus on the safety of our employees is a critical aspect of our operations, and we strive towards achieving zero injuries, spills, or process safety incidents in our facilities every year. Our EH&S management system promotes a culture of rigorous investigation, corrective action, and continuous improvement applied over many years and has delivered a world-class set of internal safety policies, processes, and procedures. This system is designed to meet our objectives to 

19



continually reduce safety and environmental incidents and risks, maintain full regulatory compliance and optimize resources and continuously improve.
The Company has taken proactive steps to minimize the potential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our employees. These steps include, but are not limited to: (i) encouraging or requiring our employees to work from home where possible or required by local laws and regulations; (ii) instituting masking and social distancing rules in our manufacturing and office locations; (iii) providing personal protective equipment; (iv) screening protocols; (v) implementing cleaning and other measures in the workplace; and (vi) conducting training for all employees. Corporate and regional COVID-19 crisis response teams lead the implementation of our pandemic response plans and other measures in our regions and at all our facilities in accordance with local requirements and guidance from the Center of Disease Control, local health departments and other health organizations. These measures have allowed us to protect worker safety while we strive to optimize production schedules, balance staffing needs, develop contingency plans, and enable the continued safe operation of our plants and facilities. We have not announced significant layoffs or employee furloughs as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
​
Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity
We are committed to maintaining an inclusive workforce that offers a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experience, and creating an environment in which all Trinseo employees have an equal opportunity to reach their potential and contribute fully to the success of the Company. Trinseo provides an equal employment opportunity, with a policy to recruit, hire, develop, and promote qualified applicants or employees without regard to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age or disability. We believe our commitment to diversity is reflected in our Board and executive leadership team. Four of our Board members, or 30% of our Board, are women, and two of our directors self-identify as a member of an underrepresented minority group. The members of our executive leadership team also represent broad citizenship and geographic diversity.
​
Talent Management and Employee Development
We provide opportunities for career development through a combination of training, coaching, and on-the-job experiences. We believe this approach to development provides our employees with the right balance of learning options. Further, we believe that early investment in our employees ensures that our future leaders have the skills they will need to be successful within a complex and ever-changing business environment. As part of our People Strategy, we conduct a talent review process that assesses our employee’s leadership behaviors, attributes, potential, and provides them with input on personal development. We also utilize a goal setting scorecard that enables employees to document and align their goals within a leadership team and across functions, which goals are set against annual Company priorities. Employees are evaluated on their performance versus individual goals and on the Company’s performance versus corporate goals (which includes financial and safety metrics). Part of the annual performance review process includes personal assessment goals which are tracked and reviewed throughout the year.
​
Compensation Policies
Trinseo’s process for determination of remuneration consists of two main components: base pay and an annual variable program, and we are committed to ensuring equitable compensation among our employees. As stated above, equal opportunity and diversity are important at Trinseo. We conduct internal reviews to assess fair treatment to determine if our pay practices are being implemented appropriately in all jurisdictions where we operate.
