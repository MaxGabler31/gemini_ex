Galaxy’s distribution channel consists of a direct sales model, as well as approximately 44 resellers across the U.S. who primarily sell the products offered by Galaxy within the commercial and educational market. Galaxy does not control where the resellers focus their reselling efforts; however, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy’s sales. In addition, Galaxy's OEM division also manufacturers products for other vendors in its industry and white labels the products under other brands.



We believe the market space for interactive technology in the classroom is a perpetual highway of business opportunity, especially in light of the global ongoing novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic as school systems have sought to expand their ability to operate remotely. Public and private school systems are in a continuous race to modernize their learning environments. Our goal is to be an early provider of the best and most modern technology available.



We are striving to become a leader in the market for interactive flat panel technology, associated software, and peripheral devices for classrooms. Our goal is to provide an intuitive system to enhance the learning environment and create easy to use technology for the teacher, increasing student engagement and achievement. Our products are developed and backed by a management team with more than 30 combined years in the classroom technology space.

Industry Background and Trends



Over the years, our products have evolved significantly from interactive whiteboards and other analog type classroom technologies to high-definition displays and collaboration software. In the mid-2000s, schools began to adopt interactive whiteboard type technology to assist in increasing student engagement and give teachers tools that were more amenable to the way our students were learning. This evolution continues to move towards learning environments that are flexible, collaborative, and motivating for our digital natives.

The educational technology market is currently experiencing substantial growth due to government mandates for improving the education results in the United States. Education, governments, corporations, and individuals are recognizing the growing need to utilize technology for more effective delivery of information to educate end users. Today, most classrooms are equipped with some type of smart board technology but given the ever-changing nature of technology, previous investments are becoming obsolete. The industry has several hundred technology resellers, selling a variety of products, already selling to these entities directly. Our goal is to target the resellers to gain market share growth in the education technology market. With the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and business. While our sales have not declined and have increased as school systems have sought to expand their ability to operate remotely during this pandemic, we have experienced supply chain delays.



Description of Business



We are engaged in a full range of activities: marketing and sales, engineering and product design and development, manufacturing, and distributing. We are a manufacturer and distributor of interactive learning technologies and enhanced audio solutions. We develop both hardware and software that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. We also develop award winning classroom audio solutions and school PA and Intercom products, creating a full line card offering for classrooms to our channel partners.
Marketing and Sales. Our sales force is comprised of direct sales staff and resellers located throughout the United States supporting all customer types in both sales and service. We historically have used a direct sales force for our Interactive Panel line of products and accessories. We utilize our resellers where geographically available and continue to expand the number of resellers available to us to market and sell the product line(s) into new territories. Our current distribution channel consists of 44 resellers across the United States who primarily sell our product within the commercial and educational market. While we do not control where our resellers focus their efforts, based on experience, the kindergarten through 12th grade education market is the largest customer base for the product, comprising nearly 90% of all purchases. We support our direct sales team as well as our resellers through direct mail/email advertising, social media campaigns, trade journal advertising, trade show exhibitions and accessibility to our regional teams for online and on-site demonstrations and meetings.
Engineering and Product Design and Development. The education technology sector is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and advancements in the way we learn. To remain competitive, we have a tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product needs in the marketplace. We employ and contract with engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design; application engineering; software design; and customer and product support. We work closely with our customers to ensure product changes and upgrades are in line with end user needs and goals. Product improvements and quality control and of upmost importance to our development team and high-level testing and certifications go into each new product design.
Manufacturing. We are the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for an audio amplification device used primarily in classrooms. Most of these products are manufactured in the United States, specifically in Arizona, Washington, and Utah. We contract out most component manufacturing, but handle internally system manufacturing (electronic assembly, sub-assembly, programming, and final assembly) and testing to manage quality control, improve response time, and maximize cost-effectiveness. A key strategy of ours is to increase our OEM partners and standardize on commonality of parts across all product lines to increase efficiencies.

-5-


Distributing. We are also the original design manufacturer (ODM) for our line of Interactive Flat Panels and accessories. Most of these products are manufactured outside of the United States, primarily in China. We perform product testing, programming, and software installation state-side to ensure quality control and maximize order response time.
Customer Service and Support. We offer limited warranties on our products, ranging from 0 to 5 years, against failure due to defective parts of workmanship. In addition, we offer service agreements of various scopes mostly related to our Bell, Paging, and Intercom products. To serve our customers, we provide a help-desk access, parts repair, and product replacement. Our technical help desk is available for customer support and is positioned to repair via phone or email most warranty issues. Our field service personnel and third-party service partners are trained to provide on-site support or product replacements.

Each of these product families are described below:



G2 Slim Interactive Flat Panel Displays. These LED interactive touch panel devices are sold in a variety of sizes; 55", 65", 75" and 86". They are mainly controlled and operated by an Android operating system and are equipped with several different applications that enhance the learning or collaborative environment. Each panel is sold with a wireless streaming application that allows for the participants to ‘cast' from their device to the interactive flat panel's display. We also offer a bundled solution for a more robust software suite to include interactive whiteboarding software, educational games, and pre-made interactive lessons. We offer a range of mounting and installation options including mobile carts, carts that convert to flat tables, and wall mounting options. In addition to the onboard Android operating system, we also offer an integrated Windows machine that is customizable to the client's specifications.



G2 Communicator Bell, Paging, and Intercom. Our proprietary line ‘G2 Communicator' offers a solution, either in-cloud or on-premise, for initiating bells, paging, or intercom calls. It offers clients a simple user interface with mapping software, zoning, and device management to fluidly run the system, initiate calls, or manage offline devices from any internet enabled hardware device. We offer our solution as a fully packaged G2 Suite, with our own branded 7-volt amplifiers, IP endpoints, and IP speakers, or it is integrated into existing environments where other branded peripherals are already installed. This gives us flexibility to accommodate not only new system installs but also building remodels and infrastructure build outs.



Our newest addition to the G2 Communicator family of products is the G2 Visual Communicator. This product offers an alerting system (often referred to as G2 Visual Alerts) which overtakes the screen of any enrolled device to send instant communications anytime and from anywhere. Its integration with the bell, paging, and intercom products make it an easy upgrade to be able to have the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) compliant component of a visual bell or page while also offering a solution in emergency situations to make sure communication is being delivered throughout the building in an audible and visual way.



G2 Secure was brought to market this year and resides as a module inside of G2 Communicator. G2 Secure enables quick and efficient communication throughout the campus and with first responders during crisis situations. G2 Secure also can monitor other safety devices, such as door locks, access control, and video doorbells to make sure the school is ‘hardened’ and safe from further unwanted penetration. Future development of this product will include additional features such as, student check-in so that the school admin has immediate insight into the safety of each individual. 



Classroom Audio Amplification Solutions. Most of our audio solutions are currently being sold to companies as a white labeled product and do not carry the ‘G2' brand. This product family includes an amplifier which carries audio from both the teacher microphone and the student microphone to speakers throughout the environment. The product was developed internally by our engineering team and has unique technological features specific to our intellectual properties. The amplifier supports many inputs and outputs and allows for SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) calls and multicast protocols to pass through, giving our development team flexibility on future upgrades. This particular product family also carries our ‘Call Switch' which allows for one-button communication between the room in which it is installed and the central location for communication. It includes a button for basic two way calls as well as a separate button for emergency calls. The bulk of our future development is within this family of products and we continue to not only expand our product offerings in the audio amplification segment but also our customers within our white labeled offerings.



Raw Materials



Materials used in the production of our manufactured items are sourced from around the world. Examples of the materials we use in production include plastics, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, power supplies, and other raw materials. We source most of our materials from multiple sources but may still have a limited number of suppliers due to the proprietary nature of the materials. Part unavailability, tariff changes, or defects in components could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. Our sourcing partners and internal team works to implement strategies to mitigate these risks.

-7-


During late fiscal 2022, supply chain disruptions began to emerge because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including shipping container shortages and changes in global demand We were specifically impacted by the global shortage of semiconductors and related electronic components, other materials needed for production, and freight availability. We have internally adapted new ways of securing components and raw material to mitigate these issues and will continue to monitor the impact or potential impact any supply shortages may have on our business.



Intellectual Property



We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. This should allow us to pursue infringement claims against competitors for protection due to patent violations. Although we own patents and possess rights under others to which we attach importance, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. We also own a number of trademarks that we believe are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated good will with customers, but no part of our business materially depends on such trademarks. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements with our employees and agents to protect our intellectual property. Despite these intellectual property protections, there can be no assurance a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products.



As of September 20, 2022, we had two (2) US patent issued and two (2) pending publications, one utility patent filed on January 22, 2019 and 1 design patent filed on July 2, 2019:



(1) 70701-1040, entitled "ASSISTIVE LISTENING SYSTEM THAT USES SOUND WAVES FOR DEVICE PAIRING". Our US patent has terms until January 22, 2039.

(2) US11363379B2, entitled “AUDIO/VISUAL DEVICE WITH CENTRAL CONTROL, ASSISTIVE LISTENING, OR A SCREEN”. Our US patent has terms until June 12, 2039.

Seasonality



Our revenue has historically fluctuated due to the impact of purchasing cycles with school budgets. School budgets follow a June 30 year end, and because of this, we see larger ordering towards the end of the school fiscal year and the beginning of the school fiscal year when new budgets are allocated.



Because of the seasonality and volatility in business demand and variety of product types, we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our business and operating results.



We have added additional revenue streams with our OEM customers in order to mitigate this historic seasonality and hope to extend our offerings into other verticals outside of education in order to have a more constant sales cycle moving forward



Opportunities and Plan of Operations



We believe that our products, both hardware and software, and the products we intend to develop as part of our extensive product road map, positions us to be one of the leading providers of interactive educational products and audio amplification devices. We believe that the increase in consumer spending along with the ever-evolving increase in standards for curriculum are two driving forces for the increase in the demand for interactive educational technology. Some additional factors that we believe will impact our opportunity include:



- Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers Report, United States education expenditure (primary, secondary and post-secondary) has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, with primary and secondary education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is approximated at roughly triple United States spending for primary and secondary education.



- The United States primary and secondary market has always been a point of political debate and scrutiny. With American students ranking far behind other global students in international tests, the United States education system severely impairs the United States' economic, military, and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America's global leadership.

-8-


-The United States education system has also seen major increases in budgets due to stimulus funds being distributed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools are encouraged to spend their CARES and ESSER monies on technology and products such as ours to assist them in overcoming the new challenges the pandemic has caused within our education system.



-The demand for Interactive Flat Panels is on the rise. With traditional interactive whiteboards having been in the market for more than fifteen years, many of these technologies are coming to a refresh period and are being replaced with the newer, more advanced interactive flat panels.



-The demand has also increased for our Communicator software, most relevantly our Visual Communicator software as emergency alerting continues to be a best practice to implement school safety procedures.



We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce and sell products. We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below and expect to continue to do so in the upcoming years. In order to implement each goal pertaining to growth, we may need additional capital to implement each strategy, particularly in relation to the target acquisition(s) of complementary businesses or technologies.



We intend to grow our business by using the following methodology:



- Capitalizing on market trends in the educational industry: We believe our long history of selling into the K-12 education market provides us with the expertise to continue to stay on the cutting edge of new product development and needs of the classroom teacher. We also believe our expertise in customer service and training positions us well for expected growth. We intend to build our core business by leveraging the strengths of our leadership and building out a solid team with experience and expertise in our market.



- Expanding our reseller channel sales: The educational technology industry is driven to a great extent by relationships. We intend to continue to grow and expand our resellers and integrators in strategic geographical regions so that we can leverage the relationships in the local school systems within those regions.



- Growth through acquisitions: We believe that the interactive and collaborative classroom as well as school safety and security have many components and moving parts. We intend to stay on the cutting edge of new products by building out our product offerings and line card through strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business by adding complementary products and new innovative technologies to provide a broader experience to our customers. We intend to pursue acquisitions that provide services within our current core product offerings, extend our geographic reach, and expand our product offerings.

-9-


- Further developing intellectual property: We intend to build upon our success in developing original software that we own and license to other brands, and distributors globally. When we develop an original software or application, we retain the copyright and patent of that content. We expect to create additional revenue streams from development fees, brand license fees, distribution license fees and ancillary sources.



- Expanding our geographic presence: We believe that by expanding our physical presence into select domestic and international regions, we will be better able to attract and retain clients. With a physical presence in strategic locations around the US, we believe we can provide better customer service and offer local services and training resulting in an increase in revenue for those areas.



Logistics and suppliers



Logistics are currently provided by our Toccoa, Georgia, Broomfield, Colorado, Jacksonville, Florida and Peoria, Arizona facilities and multiple import and freight carriers throughout the US. These partners allow us to provide affordable freight routes and shorter delivery times to our customers. Our suppliers for ODM and OEM are located in the USA, China, and Taiwan.



Concentrations



Galaxy contracts the manufacture of its products with domestic and overseas suppliers. The Company's sales could be adversely impacted by a supplier's inability to provide Galaxy with an adequate supply of inventory. Galaxy has three vendors that accounted for approximately 83% of purchases for the year ended June 30, 2022 and two vendors that accounted for approximately 75% if purchases for the year ended June 30, 2021, respectively.  See risk factor “We are dependent upon a limited number of third party manufacturers and key suppliers for the components used in our products. Our suppliers may not be able to always supply components or products to us on a timely basis and on favorable terms, and as a result, our dependency on third party suppliers has adversely affected our revenue and may continue to do so.”



Galaxy has two customers that accounted for approximately 77% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2022 and two customers that accounted for approximately 73% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2021. Galaxy has three customers that account for 66% of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022. Galaxy has two customers that accounted for approximately 50% of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021. See the risk Factor” For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.”

Competition



We encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product and geographic area. Our competitors include both United States and foreign companies and range in size and product offerings. Our competitors may develop lower-cost or lower-featured products and may be willing to charge lower prices to increase their market share. Some competitors have more capital, supply chain access, and other resources which may allow them to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements.



The interactive education industry is highly competitive and has frequent product introductions and quick technological advances. With less barriers on the school technology entry, we face heated competition from other interactive panel developers, manufacturers, and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive panels and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch.



The classroom audio portion of our industry is less competitive with only approximately 4 major competitors in the US. With our ability to manufacture this product ourselves we have a price advantage over the other players in this market. We also continue to improve features with our team of internal developers to make sure this product line stays at the top of the industry standards. 



The Intercom industry has seen tremendous increases in interest and buying, mainly a reflection of the need to make sure that school communication is a top priority during emergency situations. G2 Secure is first to market in terms of integrating the emergency communication platform into an intercom system, giving the schools one platform for all communication. 



We believe that our ability to compete depends upon customer centric product quality and features, technical expertise, and cost-effective solutions.



Research and Development



We believe our experience in engineering, process design, product design and development capabilities, and the investments made in our team to date, such as hiring third party developers, designers and coders are very important factors in being able to continue to develop, produce, and offer the most up-to-date technology desired by our market.



Over the past four years, we have invested in our team third party developers, designers and coders and our development to increase our differentiated product platforms, advance our software architecture and offerings, support customer requirements, and advance our competitive landscape.



Product design and development investments in the near term are focused on developing or improving our audio technology and our school safety technology. The new technologies are focused on improving communication in schools during crisis events to ensure safety protocols are accessible and easy to manage by school employees.



Material Agreements



Manufacturer and Distributorship Agreement



On September 15, 2018, the Company signed an agreement with a company in China for the manufacture of Galaxy’s SLIM series of interactive panels. The manufacturer agreed to manufacture, and the Company agreed to be the sole distributor of the interactive panels in the United States for a term of two years. The agreement includes a commitment by Galaxy to purchase $2 million of product during the first year beginning September 2018.

Corporate History 



Galaxy Next Generation LTD CO. (“Galaxy CO”) was organized in the state of Georgia in February 2017 while R&G Sales, Inc. (“R&G”) was organized in the state of Georgia in August 2004. Galaxy CO merged with R&G (“common controlled merger”) on March 16, 2018, with R&G becoming the surviving company. R&G subsequently changed its name to Galaxy Next Generation, Inc. (“Private Galaxy”).



FullCircle Registry, Inc. (“FLCR”), which was originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 2000 as Excel Publishing, Inc., is a holding company created for the purpose of acquiring small profitable businesses to provide exit plans for those company’s owners. FLCR’s subsidiary, FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. (“Entertainment” or “FLCE”), owned and operated Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located in Indianapolis, Indiana.



On June 22, 2018, we consummated a reverse triangular merger whereby Private Galaxy (co-founded by our now executives, Gary LeCroy (CEO) and Magen McGahee (CFO)), merged with and into our newly formed subsidiary, Galaxy MS, Inc. (“Galaxy MS” or “Merger Sub”), which was formed specifically for the transaction. Under the terms of the merger, the shareholders of Private Galaxy transferred all their outstanding shares of common stock to Galaxy MS, in return for shares of our Series C Preferred Stock. Prior to the merger, we operated under the name FullCircle Registry, Inc. and our operations were based upon our ownership of Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located on approximately seven acres in Indianapolis, Indiana. Prior to the merger, our sole business and source of revenue was from the operation of the theater, and as part of the merger agreement, we had the right to spinout the theater to the prior shareholders of FLCR. Effective February 6, 2019, we sold our interest in the theater to focus our resources on our technology operations.



In recognition of Private Galaxy’s merger with FLCR, several things occurred: (1) on August 30, 2018, FLCR amended and restated its articles of incorporation to change its name from FullCircle Registry, Inc. to Galaxy Next Generation, Inc.; (2) the Company changed its fiscal year end to June 30, effective June 2018; (3) the Company’s authorized shares of preferred stock were increased to 200,000,000 and authorized shares of common stock were increased to 4,000,000,000 (prior to the Reverse Stock Split) both with a par value of $0.0001; (4) the Board of Directors and Executive Officers approved Gary LeCroy, President and Director; Magen McGahee, Secretary and Director; and Carl Austin, Director; and (5) the primary business operated by the combined company became the business that was operated by Private Galaxy.

On September 4, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of both Interlock Concepts, Inc. (“Concepts”) and Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc. (“Solutions”) pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement that we entered into with Concepts and Solutions. Under the stock purchase agreement, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of both Concepts and Solutions. The purchase price for the acquisition was 1,350,000 shares of common stock and a two year note payable to the seller in the principal amount of $3,000,000. The note payable to the seller is subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain future earnings goals and successful completion of certain pre-acquisition withholding tax issues of Concepts and Solutions.



On October 15, 2020, we acquired the assets of Classroom Technologies Solution, Inc. (“Classroom Tech”) for consideration of (a) paying off a secured Classroom Tech loan, not to exceed the greater of 50% of the value of the Classroom Tech assets acquired or $120,000; (b) the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $44,526 to a Classroom Tech designee; and (c) the issuance of 10 million shares of common stock to the seller of Classroom Tech. The Entertainment segment was sold on February 6, 2019 in exchange for 38,625 (193 shares after adjustment for 200:1 reverse split) shares of our common stock.



On March 7, 2022, we effected a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 1-for-200 basis.



On August 31, 2022, we filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 20,000,000 to 200,000,000. 



Our principal executive offices are located at 285 Big A Road Toccoa, Georgia 30577, and our telephone number is (706) 391-5030. Our website address is www.galaxynext.us. Information contained in our website does not form part of this Annual Report and is intended for informational purposes only.



COVID-19



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization determined that the outbreak constituted a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and declared a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting businesses and affecting production and sales across a range of industries, as well as causing volatility in the financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customer demand, sales and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on our customers and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. See “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with the pandemic.



The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated cloud transformation efforts for new and existing customers and underscored the importance and mission-critical nature of multi-cloud strategies. Over the last several months, customers have increasingly turned to cloud solutions to pivot to new business models, improved their disaster recovery of mission critical data, migrated to cloud based solutions and reduced their capital expenditure requirements.



In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees. Since March 9, 2020, over 90% of our employees work remotely. All of our employees have had the ability to work remotely utilizing solutions the Company provides to their clients and distribution channels. Additionally, our remote, technology-enabled model has enabled minimal disruption to our go-to-market efforts and service delivery organizations.



The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly evolving, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on our operations or financial performance; however, the ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our customers, vendors and employees and its impact on our sales cycles as well as industry events, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

On April 30, 2020, we were granted a loan from a banking institution, in the principal amount of approximately $310,000 (the “Loan”), pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under Division A, Title I of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Loan, which was in the form of a Note dated April 30, 2020, matures on April 30, 2022 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly to Signature Bank, as lender, commencing on November 5, 2020.  Funds from the loan may only be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage payments, lease payments and utility payments. Management intends to use the entire Loan amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the Loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. We applied for and was granted forgiveness of the loan. 



In May 2020, we received a loan from the SBA under Section 7(b) of the Small Business Act. The $150,000 secured loan matures in May 2050 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 3.75%. The promissory note is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The loan proceeds are to fund working capital needs due to economic injury caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 



The Cares Act allowed employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer’s share of Social Security taxes from March 27, 2020 through September 30, 2021. The deferred deposits of the employer’s share of Social Security tax must be deposited 50% by December 31, 2021, and 50% by December 31, 2022. The Company’s remaining deferred deposits and current payments due amounted to $457,704 of Social Security Tax at June 30, 2022. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company applied for Employee Retention Credits and has recognized approximately $40,000 as a reduction to operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.



The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain COVID-19. See also “Risk Factors” for more information.
