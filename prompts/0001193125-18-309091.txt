 Item 1. Business
Overview 
 Symantec Corporation is a global leader in cyber security. We provide cyber security products, services and solutions to more than 350,000 organizations and 50 million individuals worldwide. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform helps enterprise, business and government customers unify cloud and on-premises security to protect against threats and safeguard information across every control point and attack vector. Our Cyber Safety solutions (delivered through the Norton and LifeLock offerings) help consumers protect their information, identities, devices and networks at home and online. 
 Our business and consumer offerings are powered by the largest civilian threat intelligence network, which uses machine learning and human intelligence to analyze trillions of rows of data every day across hundreds of millions of devices to discover and help prevent advanced threats that might otherwise go undetected. We believe this threat intelligence data is a competitive advantage, and a primary way we are able to provide faster and better protection for customers. 
 Founded in 1982, Symantec has operations in more than 45 countries. Our headquarters are located at 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, California. Our Internet home page is located at www.symantec.com. The information contained, or referred to, on our website is not part of this annual report unless expressly noted. 
 Fiscal 2018 Business Highlights 
 During fiscal 2018, we continued to make progress enhancing and expanding our product and services portfolio and improving product integration, partner integration and sales delivery to help business customers deploy our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. We also made progress driving revenue growth and market adoption for our Consumer Digital Safety solutions, building on our Norton and LifeLock product portfolio. In addition, we implemented operational improvements to reduce costs and complexity, building on the business transformation programs we initiated in fiscal 2017, and leveraged synergies from the successful integration of our acquired businesses.

Our field sales team leverages our global partner ecosystem, primarily targeting senior executives and IT department personnel responsible for managing a companys highest-order IT and cyber security initiatives. 
 We also sell and market our products and services to small, medium and large businesses through field sales and inside sales forces that leverage indirect sales partners around the world, who are specifically trained and certified to sell our solutions. These partners include national solution providers, regional solution providers, national account resellers, global/federal system integrators, and managed service providers. 
 Our enterprise products and services are also available on our e-commerce platform, as well as through authorized distributors, GSIs and OEMs, who incorporate our technologies into their products, bundle our products with their offerings, or serve as authorized resellers of our products. 
 Consumer 
 We sell and market our consumer products and services to individuals, households and small businesses globally. We bring these products to market through direct marketing and co-marketing programs supported by our e-commerce and tele-sales platforms. In addition, we utilize Internet-based resellers, system builders, ISPs, employee benefits providers, wireless carriers, retailers, and OEMs to distribute our offerings worldwide. We drive consumer business growth through global brand and demand campaigns, new customer acquisition, improved retention cross-sell and customer success programs. 
Research and Development 
 Symantec embraces a global research and development strategy to drive organic innovation and product integration across our portfolio. Our engineering and product management teams are focused on delivering new versions of existing product lines as well as developing entirely new products and 
 
8 


  services to drive the companys leadership in cyber security. We also have a technology research organization focused on short, medium, and longer-term applied research projects, with the goal of transferring completed innovations into our product groups for commercialization. 
 Symantecs Security Technology and Response organization is a global team of security engineers, threat analysts, and researchers who provide the underlying functionality, content, and support for many of our solutions. These front-line security experts analyze threat telemetry collected through our vast cyber intelligence networks to protect our customers against current and emerging threats. Our research and development teams also leverage these vast data sets and insights to develop new technologies and approaches in order to improve security outcomes for our customers. 
 Research and development expenses were $956 million, $823 million and $748 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe that technical leadership is essential to our success, and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development. 
 Product and Technical Support 
 Symantec has support facilities throughout the world, staffed by technical product experts knowledgeable in the operating environments in which our products are deployed. Our support experts assist customers with both issue resolution and threat detection. 
 We provide Enterprise Security customers with various levels of support. Our support program offers annual maintenance support contracts, including content, updates, and technical support.

Our Consumer Digital Safety service and support offerings come with 24x7x365 support, along with remediation services during normal business hours. 
 Competition 
 Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject to rapid changes in technology. The competitive landscape has changed significantly over the past few years, with new competition arising. Some of the market growth has come from startups that focus on solving a particular issue or delivering a niche-oriented product, and from larger integration providers that increasingly seek to add to or extend their offerings. We focus on delivering comprehensive customer solutions, integrating across our broad product portfolio and partnering with other technology providers to differentiate our offerings and platforms from the competition. 
 In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors, we face indirect or potential competition from retailers, application providers, operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers and other OEMs who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future offerings. We compete with these same parties to acquire technologies, products, or companies. We also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by OEMs. We compete for access to distribution channels and for spending at the retail level for our consumer offerings and in corporate accounts for our enterprise offerings.

 Intellectual Property 
 Protective measures 
 We regard some of the features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other measures to protect our proprietary information. Our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and technology and enhance our competitive position. 
 As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors, and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. These license agreements are 
 
10 


  generally non-transferable and have either a perpetual or subscription based time limited term. We also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities, equipment, and networks. 
 Trademarks, patents, copyrights, and licenses 
 Symantec, and the Symantec Norton and LifeLock logos, are trademarks or registered trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition, we have used, registered, or applied to register other trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and other countries. We actively enforce our trademark, service mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad based on our rights under common law, and various state and federal laws and regulations, as well as rights recognized by international treaties and conventions. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country, and in the U.S. we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use. 
 We have approximately 2,225 patents, in addition to foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. 
 Our products are protected under U.S. and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information. We take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide sufficient protection, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products, and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights. While we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right. 
 Seasonality 
 As is typical for many large technology companies, our business is seasonal. Revenues are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
 Corporate Responsibility 
 Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report can be found via the Symantec website at https://www.symantec.com/about/corporate-responsibility. 
 Audit Committee Investigation Completed
