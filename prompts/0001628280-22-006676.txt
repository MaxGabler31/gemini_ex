Item 1. Business. 
Overview
Driven Brands is the largest automotive services company in North America with a growing and highly-franchised base of more than 4,400 locations across 49 U.S. states and 14 other countries. Our scaled, diversified platform provides high-quality services to an extensive range of consumer and commercial customers who rely on their automobiles in all economic environments to get to work and in many other aspects of their daily lives. Our breadth of services cover a wide variety of automotive needs, including paint, collision, glass, and repair services, as well as a variety of high-frequency services, such as oil changes and car washes. Our asset-light business model has generated consistent recurring revenue and strong operating margins, with limited maintenance capital expenditures. Our network generated approximately $1.5 billion in revenue from approximately $4.5 billion in system-wide sales in 2021. 
The Company operates and reports financial information on a 52 or 53-week year with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Our 2021, 2020, and 2019 fiscal years, which ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020, and December 28, 2019, respectively, consisted of 52 weeks.
We are the largest diversified automotive services platform in North America and have a portfolio of highly recognized brands, including Take 5 Oil Change®, Meineke Car Care Centers®, MAACO®,  CARSTAR®, and 1-800-Radiator & A/C®. Our brands have been providing quality services to retail and commercial customers around the world for over 350 years combined. We believe that the longevity and awareness of our brands, tenure of our franchisees, and the quality and value of our offerings resonate deeply with our customers. Maaco and Meineke have been operating since 1972 and are two of the most recognizable brands in the industry. In addition, Take 5 Oil Change has been operating since 1984, and CARSTAR has been in operation since 1989. Our brands are supported by highly qualified Driven Brands field operations team members, who provide training and operational expertise to our franchisees and company-operated and independently-operated locations to help them deliver best-in-class customer service and drive strong financial performance. 
The Driven Brands platform enables our portfolio of brands to be stronger together than they are apart. We have invested heavily in the creation of unique and powerful shared services, which we believe provide each brand with more resources and produce better results than any individual brand could achieve on its own. Our locations are strengthened by ongoing training initiatives, targeted marketing enhancements, procurement savings, and cost efficiencies, driving revenue and profitability growth for both Driven Brands and for our franchisees. Our performance is further enhanced by a data analytics engine of approximately 22 billion data elements informed by customers across our thousands of locations at every transaction. 
Our Core Competencies
Driven Brands has a long track record of delivering strong growth through consistent same store sales performance, store count growth, and acquisitions. We believe our diversified platform is uniquely capable of offering a compelling and convenient service proposition to our customers by providing a wide breadth of services for all vehicle types and across multiple service categories including paint, collision, glass, repair, oil change, maintenance and car wash. 
The execution of successful mergers and acquisitions is a core competency of the Driven Brands platform. We have invested in and built out a dedicated team and supporting infrastructure and processes to systematically source, perform due diligence on, acquire and integrate locations. Since 2015, we have completed more than 100 acquisitions. Notably, in August 2020 we acquired International Car Wash Group (“ICWG”), the world’s largest car wash company by location count with more than 900 locations across 14 countries. Our expansion into the car wash segment was further complemented by the tuck-in acquisitions of 17 additional car wash locations during the fourth quarter of 2020 and 110 locations in 2021. Additionally, we have grown our collision service offerings through the acquisitions of CARSTAR in 2015, ABRA in 2019, and Fix Auto USA (“Fix Auto”) in 2020. We have also expanded into adjacent, complementary service offerings, including oil change services through our acquisition of Take 5 in 2016 and glass services in 2019.
Our Growth Strategies 
We plan to continue to grow our business by executing on the following strategies: 
Grow Our Brands with New Locations
We have a proven track record of unit growth and believe our competitive strengths provide us with a solid financial and operational foundation to continue growing our footprint. Our franchise growth is driven both by new store openings as well as through conversions of independent market participants that do not have the benefits of our scaled platform. Our attractive unit economics, national brand recognition, strong insurance and fleet customer relationships, and beneficial shared services capabilities provide highly compelling economic benefits for our franchisees, resulting in a strong desire to join and stay within our network. As of December 25, 2021, we had agreements to open more than 900 new franchised units, which provides us with visibility into future franchise unit growth. 
Additionally, we continue to expand our company-operated Take 5 quick lube footprint and our domestic company-operated car wash and glass repair and replacement businesses, through new greenfield openings as well as tuck-in acquisitions and conversions. The oil change, car wash and glass repair and replacement markets in North America are highly fragmented, providing significant runway for continued growth. The success of our company-operated locations is supported by our deep data analytics capabilities that use proprietary algorithms and insights to enable optimal site identification and selection. With low net start-up costs and strong sales ramp, company-operated locations provide highly attractive returns, and we believe there is ample whitespace in existing and adjacent markets for continued unit growth.
Continue to Drive Same Store Sales Growth 
We have demonstrated an ability to drive attractive organic growth with positive same store sales performance over 13 of the past 14 years. We believe that we are well positioned to continue benefiting from this momentum by executing on the following growth levers: 
•Continued Commercial Partnership Expansion: We are proactively growing our commercial partnerships and winning new customers by being a highly convenient and cost effective “one-stop-shop” service provider that caters to the extensive suite of automotive service needs for commercial fleet operators and insurance carriers. These customers want to work with nationally scaled and recognized chains with broad geographic coverage, extensive service offerings, strong operating metrics and centralized billing services. We have a growing team dedicated to expanding partnerships with existing commercial customers as well as attracting new national and local customers.
•Continued Growth of Subscription Car Wash Revenue Model: In 2017 prior to Driven Brands ownership, ICWG introduced a subscription membership program across its domestic car wash stores, and revenue from this subscription program has grown to more than 47% of domestic car wash revenue in 2021. In addition to fostering strong customer loyalty to our stores, we believe the subscription program also generates predictable and recurring revenue and provides incremental data and customer insights, further strengthening our data analytics capabilities. We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our subscription program. 
•Leverage Data Analytics to Optimize Marketing, Product Offerings and Pricing: We have large, dedicated brand marketing funds supported by contributions from our franchisees, and in 2021 we collected and spent approximately $114 million for marketing across our brands. Insights from our data analytics engine enhance our marketing and promotional strategy to drive growth in unit-level performance. For instance, our proprietary data algorithms help optimize lead generation and conversion through personalized, targeted, and timely marketing promotions that provide customers with the optimal offer at the right time. In addition, our data provides insights that are enabling us to identify and roll out new product offerings, improve menu design, and optimize pricing structure across our brands. Use cases like these are regularly tested, refined, and deployed across our network to drive store performance. 
Enhance Margins through Procurement Initiatives and Strengthening Platform Services 
In addition to top-line growth, Driven Brands has also been able to leverage the strength of the platform to enhance margins for franchised, independently-operated, and company-operated locations through the following levers: 
•Leverage Shared Services and Platform Scale: We expect to continue to benefit from margin improvements associated with our increasing scale and the growing efficiency of our platform. As a result of the investments we have made, we believe our shared services provide substantial operating leverage and can support a much larger business than we are today. Driven Brands has also been increasing margins through technology advancements to enhance in-store operations and deploy best-practice training initiatives across the portfolio.
•Utilize Purchasing Strength from Procurement Programs: Driven Brands currently provides franchisees, independently-operated, and company-operated locations with lower pricing on supplies than they could otherwise achieve on their own, thereby augmenting the value proposition to new and existing franchisees as well as the earnings of our independently-operated and company-operated locations. Our procurement programs provide us with recurring revenue via supplier rebates and product margin. As we continue to grow organically and through acquisition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving lower procurement pricing and more benefits to our overall system. 
Pursue Accretive Acquisitions in Existing and New Service Categories 
We believe that we are optimally positioned to continue our long and successful track record of acquisitions, both in our existing service categories, as well as into new, complementary ones, while also maintaining an actionable pipeline of M&A opportunities. Since 2015, we have completed more than 100 acquisitions, and since 2019, the Company expanded into both car wash and glass services, which have provided us with new organic and acquisition growth opportunities in two highly fragmented service categories. In addition, the evolving vehicle technology landscape provides numerous opportunities for Driven Brands to leverage its scale and core competencies to continue to expand our market share. We plan to capitalize on the highly fragmented nature of the automotive services industry by continuing to execute on accretive acquisitions using our proven acquisition strategy and playbook. 
Our acquisition strategy is enhanced by our data analytics engine, which is powered by internally-collected data from consumers, their vehicles and services that are provided to us at each transaction, and further enriched by third-party data. This powerful data gathering capability results in more than 60 million data elements collected each month and a growing data repository with approximately 22 billion unique elements, which we use throughout our platform for improving our marketing and customer prospecting capabilities, measuring location performance, enhancing store-level operations, and optimizing our real estate site selection. As we grow organically and through acquisitions, we believe the power of our shared services and data analytics will grow and will continue to be a key differentiator for our business.
Segment Information
Our suite of automotive services include the following segments:
Maintenance
Our Maintenance segment is primarily comprised of the Take 5 Oil Change (“Take 5”) and Meineke Car Care Centers ("Meineke") brands. Our Maintenance brands service a combination of retail and commercial customers, such as fleet operators, through 1,505 total locations as of December 25, 2021. This excludes the 62 Drive N Style store locations, which are being marketed for sale. Our maintenance services include oil changes and other regularly scheduled or as-needed automotive services, including vehicle component repair and replacement.
Take 5 specializes in providing efficient drive-thru-style oil changes. Founded in 1984, Take 5’s 165 franchised and 543 company-operated locations as of December 25, 2021, primarily offer oil changes to retail and commercial customers. We believe Take 5 offers a best-in-class operating model through its convenient drive-thru stay-in-your-car format, simple, focused menu, industry-leading speed of service and low-pressure sales environment, which is designed to generate strong customer satisfaction, high frequency of use, and attractive unit level economics. Furthermore, Take 5’s compact store format and unique shallow pit design are intended to reduce upfront build out costs, increase efficiency, and provide real estate flexibility. Take 5’s franchising efforts are experiencing strong momentum and are expected to continue to drive long-term unit growth through its robust and growing pipeline of franchise commitments. 
Our other maintenance services offered at 797 locations as of December 25, 2021 are 100% franchised and predominantly operate under the Meineke brand. Meineke is known as an automotive services industry pioneer and was founded in 1972. These stores offer an extensive set of total car care services to retail customers and commercial fleet programs, including maintenance, repair, and replacement of components, such as brakes, heating and cooling systems, exhaust, and tires. We believe Meineke is a strong, well-known brand with high brand awareness and customer satisfaction due to its high-quality service, extensive range of service offerings, and the convenience of a nationwide network of locations.
Car Wash
We are the world’s largest conveyor car wash company by location count with 1,058 total locations across North America, Europe and Australia. Our services primarily consist of express-style exterior car wash services that utilize an automated conveyor belt to pull vehicles along a track where they are machine washed. 
Our car wash services in Europe and Australia are primarily offered through the IMO brand, which has a proud 55-year history providing express-style conveyor car wash services. IMO’s operations appeal to a broad consumer base seeking a low-cost and high-speed car wash at easily-accessible locations. Our 728 international locations operate an independent operator model, whereby a third-party is responsible for site-level labor and receives commissions based on a percent of site revenue from car washes, resulting in high margins and predictable free cash flow for Driven Brands. IMO also provides Driven Brands with a scaled international footprint from which to pursue future growth. 
Since entering the North American market in 2015, we have grown to become the second-largest domestic operator of conveyor car wash sites with 330 company-operated locations across the United States. We believe that our highly-attractive value proposition, focused on affordability, convenience, and speed of service, resonates with our customers and encourages a high frequency of use in any economic environment. To further strengthen customer loyalty and visit frequency, we also utilize a subscription membership program, which in 2021, accounted for more than 47% of our domestic car wash revenue. As one of the few scaled players in the highly fragmented North American market, we believe we are well-positioned for continued unit growth, both through greenfield openings and tuck-in acquisitions. 
Paint, Collision & Glass
Our Paint, Collision & Glass segment is primarily composed of the CARSTAR, ABRA, Fix Auto, Maaco and Uniban brands and serves both retail and commercial customers through 1,648 total locations as of December 25, 2021. Our collision services include full collision repair and refinishing services; our paint services include full body repainting and touch-up, surface preparation and protection, and refinishing and other cosmetic repairs; and our glass services include replacement, repair, and calibration services for automotive glass. 
Our collision repair services are primarily offered through CARSTAR, ABRA and Fix Auto, which were founded in 1989, 1984, and 1997, respectively, and together comprise the largest franchised collision repair network in North America. Our 992 collision locations as of December 25, 2021 are 98% franchised and offer full collision repair and refinishing services in addition to other cosmetic repairs. We maintain collaborative relationships with the top insurance carriers in the United States and Canada, which generate more than 86% of our collision revenue. 
Our paint services are offered through Maaco, which was founded in 1972. Our 425 franchised locations as of December 25, 2021 offer an extensive suite of services including paint services, surface preparation, protection and refinishing, reconditioning and other cosmetic external and internal repairs. Maaco primarily serves retail customers and commercial fleet operators and provides strong retail customer service at a much lower average price point than most collision centers, making it an economical option for minor auto body repair when customers prefer to not file a claim.
In 2021, our glass services were primarily offered through Uniban, founded in 1977 and known as a leader in the auto glass repair and replacement industry. Our glass services were offered through 214 franchised and 17 company-operated locations as of December 25, 2021, which primarily offer replacement, repair and calibration services for automotive glass with retail customers through their insurance carriers, as well as commercial fleet operators. We also offer technology-enabled glass claims management services for insurance carriers, which drives incremental business to our glass service locations and our distribution business and are complementary to our paint and collision businesses. 
Platform Services
Our Platform Services segment is primarily composed of the 1-800-Radiator & A/C (“1-800 Radiator”), PH Vitres D’Autos, Spire Supply and Automotive Training Institute (“ATI”) brands. This segment provides significant benefits to our brands by driving organic growth opportunities through procurement, distribution and training services, as well as growth opportunities through acquisition target sourcing. 
Our distribution services are primarily offered through 1-800-Radiator, which was founded in 2001 and is one of the largest franchised distributors in the automotive parts industry. 1-800-Radiator’s 201 locations, as of December 25, 2021, are over 99% franchised and distribute a broad, diverse mix of long-tail automotive parts, including radiators, air conditioning components, and exhaust products to automotive repair shops, auto parts stores, body shops, and other auto repair outlets. 1-800-Radiator’s best-in-class operating model is fueled by proprietary algorithmic sourcing technology that enables franchisees to effectively order inventory, manage pricing, and deliver parts to customers within hours. Additionally, 1-800-Radiator’s extensive distribution relationships provide Driven Brands with deep data insights and a large, actionable list of prospective acquisition targets, complementing the attractive free cash flow generation of the business. 
Founded in 1967, PH Vitres D’Autos (“PH”) distributes windshields and glass accessories through a network of distribution centers across Canada and provides direct installation services. PH is the main glass distributor to our company-operated and franchised Uniban locations. In addition, PH is the market leader in the province of Quebec and has a growing presence in Ontario. 
In 2017, we launched Spire Supply, an in-house distributor of consumable products, such as oil filters and wiper blades, which currently serves all Take 5 locations and a portion of our Meineke stores. Spire Supply provides attractive pricing to franchisees relative to other options, as well as incremental EBITDA to Driven Brands, by reducing spend that would otherwise be paid to third-party vendors. In addition, Spire Supply simplifies operations for franchisees and company-operated stores by reducing inventory needs and ensuring availability of supplies through automatic replenishment. 
Our financial and operational training services are offered through ATI, a leading provider of training services to repair and maintenance, and paint and collision shops. ATI’s core offering is a multi-year training package that is typically paid for through a monthly subscription. We believe ATI’s leading training program further enhances Driven Brands’ training platform, providing opportunities to improve operational support and increase profitability, for both Driven Brands and our franchisees. In addition, ATI’s deep customer database of automotive shops provides us with a pipeline for future franchise development and acquisitions. 
Franchising Strategy 
We rely on our franchising strategy to grow certain of our brands’ footprints in a capital efficient manner. Our franchise model leverages our proven brand playbooks, the market planning and site selection capabilities of our best-in-class development team, and the local market expertise of highly-motivated owners. Our attractive unit economics, national brand recognition, strong commercial fleet and insurance customer relationships and beneficial shared service capabilities provide highly compelling economic benefits for our franchisees, resulting in a strong desire to join and stay within our network. As of December 25, 2021, we have agreements to open more than 900 new franchised units, which provides us with clear visibility into future franchise unit growth. 
We have a strong track record of opening stores with existing and new franchisees, and we follow strict guidelines in selecting and approving franchisees, who go through extensive interview processes, background checks and are subject to financial and net-worth-based requirements. 
Company-Operated Store Strategy 
Our company-operated store strategy involves growing our Take 5, domestic car wash and domestic glass repair and replacement footprint through a combination of greenfield openings, as well as acquiring and converting stores based on our focused market expansion plan. Our best-in-class simple operating model, minimal labor requirements and low fixed costs drive highly attractive unit-level economics for our company-operated stores. Furthermore, Driven Brands’ acquisition and integration teams have a successful track-record of acquiring independent market participants and chains and converting them to our superior operating model. Our conversion playbook drives cost savings from procurement savings and general and administrative cost synergies, as well as consistent revenue growth following the conversion to our model and implementation of our operational improvements and data-driven marketing programs. 
Franchise Agreements 
For each of our franchisees across our brands, we enter into a franchise agreement covering standard terms and conditions. Under our franchise agreements, we generally grant franchisees the right to operate using our branding for an initial term (generally 5 to 20 years) with the option to renew their agreements. All proposed new store sites require formal approval from us. Generally, franchisees pay Driven Brands an initial franchise license fee and franchise royalties typically based on a percentage of gross sales. Franchisees also make or may be required to make contributions towards marketing funds, also typically based on a percentage of gross sales or, in some instances, based on a flat amount or weekly marketing budgets in the applicable designated marketing area. 
Our franchise agreements also require franchisees to comply with our standard operating methods that govern the provision of services and use of vendors and may include a requirement to purchase specified products from us, our affiliates and/or designated vendors. Outside of these standards and policies, we do not control the day-to-day operations, such as hiring and training of employees, of the franchisees. 
We support our franchisees with brand-specific services (e.g., brand marketing, franchise support, operations and franchise sales) and comprehensive shared services (e.g., centralized marketing support, consumer insights, procurement program savings, commercial fleet, training, development, finance and technology services). Our franchisees also benefit from highly qualified Driven Brands operations team members who provide consistent best-practice training and operational expertise. These support services allow our franchisees to focus on the day-to-day operations of their stores and to provide their customers with high-quality service that our customers have come to associate with our brands. 
Independent Operator Agreements 
Nearly all of our car wash locations outside of North America operate an independent operator model, where a third party is responsible for site-level labor and receives commissions based on a percentage of site revenue from car washes. At all of our independently-operated sites, we enter into an independent operator agreement covering the commission paid to the independent operator for our car wash services, terms relating to other services offered by the independent operator at the location from which we do not receive any revenue, and other standard terms and conditions including with respect to protection of confidential information, our intellectual property and customer data, standards relating to sub-contracting, indemnification and termination. 
Marketing Strategy 
Our marketing strategy highlights the needs-based service offerings and value propositions of each of our brands. We focus our marketing efforts on areas we believe will yield the highest rate of return, including the development of tailored marketing campaigns targeted at specific customers when we know they are in need of one of the services provided by our brands. 
We use a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, our brands and the products and services they offer. Our advertising strategy includes CRM, social and digital media, as well as television, print, radio and sponsorships. We have implemented highly professionalized and data-driven marketing practices and have dedicated brand marketing funds supported by contributions from our franchisees. 
Industry Overview and Competition
We compete with a variety of service providers within the highly-fragmented automotive services and parts distribution market. Competitors include international, national, regional and local repair and maintenance shops, oil change shops, car washes, paint and collision repair shops, glass repair and replacement shops, automobile dealerships, and suppliers of automotive parts, including online retailers, wholesale distributors, hardware stores, and discount and mass market merchandise stores. Given the fragmentation of the industry, our competitors include a limited number of large providers of scale. Typically, our competitors offer services within one of our categories; however, few competitors offer services across multiple categories like Driven Brands. We believe the core competitive factors in our industry are scale, geographic reach, brand awareness, service pricing, speed and quality, and customer satisfaction. 
We compete with other franchisors on the basis of the expected return on investment for franchisees and the value propositions that we offer them. We compete to sell franchises to potential franchisees who may choose to purchase franchises from other automotive aftermarket service providers, or who may also consider purchasing franchises in other industries. 
Government Regulations and Other Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and provincial laws and regulations in North America, Europe and Australia in areas such as consumer protection, occupational licensing, environmental protection, data privacy, labor and employment, tax, permitting, and other laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing employee selection, training and business conduct. 
We, as a franchisor, are subject to various state and provincial laws, and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates our franchising activities in the U.S. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Fourteen states require registration and, together with at least one other state, require specific disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales, and at least twenty states and U.S. territories have “franchise relationship laws” that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. There are also several provinces in Canada that regulate the offer and sale of franchises as well as certain aspects of the franchise relationship. While there are no registration requirements under these provincial franchise laws, they do require pre-sale disclosures similar to those that exist in the U.S. 
We are not aware of any federal, state, local, provincial or other laws or regulations that are likely to materially alter or impact our revenues, cash flow or competitive positions, or result in any material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect on our operations, particularly on our relationship with franchisees, of any pending or future legislation or regulations or the future interpretation of any existing laws, including any newly enacted laws, that may impact us or our franchisees. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources 
As of December 25, 2021, we employed approximately 9,900 full-time employees, including approximately 8,600 employees at company-operated locations. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and prospective employees. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate our employees, executive officers and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. We strive for exceptional performance and results, which is why meritocracy is one of our core values. We provide employees the opportunity to grow and to be rewarded based on results. 
Our franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not employees of Driven Brands. Our independent operators at independently-operated car wash locations are responsible for the site-level labor and as such, are not employees of Driven Brands. 
Impact of COVID-19
Commencing in December 2019, the novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”), spread rapidly throughout the world. The global crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19 has disrupted, and continues to disrupt, local, regional, and global economies and businesses in the United States and internationally. Because automotive services were generally deemed “essential” by most federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities, substantially all of Driven Brands’ locations in the United States and Canada remained open despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Since our acquisition of ICWG in August 2020, most car wash sites in Europe and Australia have remained open, with temporary closures in certain jurisdictions. In addition, certain jurisdictions in Canada, as well as certain European countries, have been subject to stricter quarantine and shelter-at-home rules which may result in future closures. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Driven Brands proactively implemented various initiatives across each of its segments, with a focus on ensuring the safety of employees, franchisees and customers, and minimizing the financial impact of COVID-19 while continuing to execute on building the foundation for future growth. 
Intellectual Property 
Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and conduct of business. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other foreign trademark registration offices or exist under common law in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services include, but are not limited to ABRA®, CARSTAR®, DrivenBrands®, IMO®, MAACO®, Meineke®, PH Vitres D’Autos®, Spire Supply®, Take 5 Oil Change®, Uniban®, and 1-800-Radiator & A/C®. We also license or sublicense, as applicable, the Fix Auto USA® trademark for use in connection with our business in the United States. We also own domain names, including our primary domain “www.drivenbrands.com.” 
Seasonality 
Seasonal changes may moderately impact the demand for our automotive repair and maintenance services, car washes and products. For example, customers may purchase fewer undercar services during the winter months, when miles driven tend to be lower. In addition, customers may defer or forego car washes or vehicle maintenance such as oil changes at any time during periods of inclement weather.
