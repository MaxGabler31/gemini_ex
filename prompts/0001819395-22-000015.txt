Item 1. Business
We were originally incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 2020 under the name “Gores Metropoulos II, Inc.” as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target businesses. On January 22, 2021 (the “IPO Closing Date”), we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO” or the “Public Offering”). On January 18, 2022, we consummated a business combination with Sonder Operating Inc. f/k/a Sonder Holdings Inc. (“Legacy Sonder”), a privately held operating company which merged into our subsidiary Sonder Holdings LLC (the “Business Combination”) and changed our name to “Sonder Holdings Inc.,” and we became the owner, directly or indirectly, of all of the equity interests of Sonder Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. In light of the fact that the Business Combination has closed and our ongoing business will be the business formerly operated by Legacy Sonder, this business section primarily includes information regarding Legacy Sonder’s business. 
Overview
Sonder is on a mission to revolutionize hospitality through design and technology to make a world of better stays open to all. Sonder’s idea was born from a simple belief that “big box” hotels are unremarkable, home-share ‘hosts’ are often unreliable, boutique hotels are too expensive, and that there is a better way to stay. Sonder provides better choice, comfort, reliability, and value brought to life through design and technology. 
Sonder accommodations come in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit all guest needs: from an apartment to a hotel room, for a night, a week, or more. Its unique product portfolio serves many use cases, from one night to extended stays for various traveler types: from leisure travelers and families, to digital nomads and professionals. 
Sonder has over 250 properties available for guest bookings, referred to as “Live” properties, which it operates and manages using proprietary technology, delivering services to guests via the Sonder app which features self-service and 24/7 on-the-ground support. Guests can book any Sonder unit through a variety of direct (e.g., Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or Sonder’s sales team) and indirect (e.g., Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com and other Online Travel Agencies) channels. Our mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel. Guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with Sonder services and enhance their stay, but guests are not required to use the Sonder app to stay in a Sonder unit. With an innovative end-to-end model, Sonder offers elevated and consistent quality at a compelling value to its guests.
Sonder had Live Units in 38 cities in 10 countries and three continents as of December 31, 2021. We had approximately 1,600 employees as of December 31, 2021, as well as localized teams in each of our active markets around the world.
Sonder’s Origin 
While a university student in Montreal, our co-founder and CEO Francis Davidson managed a handful of apartments and began to envision a new set of ideals for hospitality. Over the next few summers, he experimented with matching travelers to vacant student apartments across cities and managing other people’s apartments for short-term rentals. A few years later, he and co-founder Martin Picard solidified the foundation that would become Sonder today. 
Sonder Today 
What began as a journey to provide short-term living solutions for travelers has grown into a celebration of inspiring design, modern service and a seamless experience, providing a better stay for all. Less than a decade after being dreamt up in a college dorm room, Sonder has grown into a global business operating over 7,600 units available for guest bookings (“Live Units”) across 38 cities in 10 countries and three continents, and with approximately 10,500 additional units that have signed real estate contracts, but are not yet available for guests to

book (“Contracted Units”), as of December 31, 2021. We have hosted over one million guests around the world, from New York City to New Orleans, Montreal to Mexico City, Dublin to Dubai, and beyond. 
Sonder is Positioned at the Nexus of Modern Hospitality and Technology
Sonder provides a unique solution to (i) serve the demands of the modern traveler, and (ii) tap into the underutilized commercial real estate and hospitality supply in cities around the world. Sonder’s design-led, tech-enabled experience drives exceptional value to both guests and real estate owners, as Sonder transforms high quality properties provided by real estate owners into exceptional experiences for Sonder’s guests. 
The Sonder Flywheel 
Sonder’s business model creates a powerful “flywheel effect.” We continually invest in technology to drive operational efficiencies and elevate guest experiences, resulting in a strong brand and robust unit economics. We believe this will allow us to continue improving the quality and quantity of the supply we can aggregate, driving growth and profitability that enables yet further investment. 
Sonder is Centered Around the Guest Experience 
Sonder strives to deliver a better way to stay and puts the guest experience at the center of everything we do. Pioneering a digitally empowered guest experience, our technology provides frictionless stays including digital check-in, keyless entry and no-line lobbies which have long formed the foundation of our tech-enabled offering and are now essential hallmarks of a safe stay. Guests can book any Sonder unit through a variety of direct (e.g., Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or Sonder’s sales team) and indirect (e.g., Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com and other Online Travel Agencies) channels. The Sonder mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel. Guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with Sonder services and enhance their stay, but guests are not required to use the Sonder app to stay in a Sonder unit. Fully-equipped kitchens, extra living space and private laundry facilities are available in many Sonder apartment spaces.
A Passion for Design 
Sonder is focused on bringing its passion for design and creativity to its guests. We take pride in the spaces and experiences we bring to life through our interdisciplinary teams and external partnerships spanning architecture, product and service design, graphic communications, copywriting, and more. Sonder properties have been featured

in publications including Surface, Travel + Leisure, Condé Nast Traveler, Elle Decor, Fast Company, Forbes, CNBC and House Beautiful. 
Supply Growth Strategy 
As of December 31, 2021, Sonder had a Total Portfolio of approximately 18,100 Live and Contracted Units diversified across both apartments and hotels. Supply growth—the expansion of Sonder’s Total Portfolio of global properties—is one of Sonder’s largest drivers of expected revenue growth over the next several years. 
In the short-term, we intend to focus our supply growth efforts primarily in our existing markets where we already have Live and/or Contracted Units. Sonder has spent the last several years building localized teams and relationships with developers, investors and property owners, and we believe there is significant opportunity for further expansion in these existing markets. In the next three to five years, we plan to expand our geographic presence into Asia and further into Latin America (building on our Mexico launch in late 2020) with plans to explore diversifying into other additional accommodation categories. 
Technology Underpins Sonder’s Operations 
Sonder believes the future of the hospitality industry is one where technology and design are applied to every aspect of the business, not just the transaction. Much like the e-commerce industry evolved from pure marketplaces to vertically integrated platforms delivering end-to-end services, Sonder applies innovation to every facet of hospitality in an end-to-end model that re-imagines the entire guest experience. From supply growth and interior design, to property openings, demand generation and day-to-day operations, technology is infused into Sonder’s DNA. We believe vertically integrated businesses may be more arduous to build, but that vertical integration is more valuable and defensible in the long run given our advantage in enhancing the guest experience and reducing operating costs. 
Our proprietary technology leads guests through their entire Sonder experience — beginning with easy, intuitive browsing of Sonder’s full portfolio to seamlessly reserving a unit. Guests can book any Sonder unit through a variety of direct (e.g., Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or Sonder’s sales team) and indirect (e.g., Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com and other Online Travel Agencies) channels. The Sonder mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel. Guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with Sonder services and enhance their stay, but guests are not required to use the Sonder app to stay in a Sonder unit. Upon arrival, Sonder’s “lobby on your phone” technology guides guests through its in-app check-in and one-touch WiFi. Our digital concierge feature offers curated lists of localized food and experience recommendations to help guests get the most out of their stay. Guests can book intra-stay cleaning and self-serve requests through Sonder’s app throughout their stay, then seamlessly check out or request trip extensions — from a few hours to days.
In addition to our guest-facing technology, Sonder’s proprietary technology underpins our hospitality operations. This proprietary technology powers Sonder’s business processes and operations, from supply growth to building openings and day-to-day operations. We have also: 
•Built infrastructure to fuel our underwriting efforts; 
•Built technology to facilitate our global supply chain for furniture, art and fixtures; 
•Developed a proprietary booking engine; 
•Developed pricing and calendar revenue management software as well as room attribution algorithms; and 
•Developed internally designed task and workflow management software. 
The integration of each of these proprietary tools is key to Sonder providing a better experience for guests at an attractive price. By leveraging technology in nearly all areas of our operations, we are able to reduce operating costs by as much as 50% versus traditional hotels, which also allows our business to scale rapidly while delivering an outstanding, modern guest experience.

COVID-19 Pandemic Response Strategy 
The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the extent to which it will continue to adversely impact Sonder remains uncertain. Sonder’s financial results for all of 2020 were materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also affected Sonder’s business in 2021. COVID-19 may continue to materially adversely impact business operations, results of operations and liquidity in the near term. As the world locked down, severely impacting Occupancy Rate and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”), Sonder acted quickly to reduce costs and bolster revenues to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of its COVID-19 response strategy, Sonder renegotiated a significant portion of its Live and Contracted Unit property portfolio, significantly reduced overhead costs, and pivoted to new sources of demand. 
As a result of Sonder’s efforts to drive alternative sources of demand through the pandemic, Sonder substantially outperformed Traditional Hotels on both an Occupancy Rate and RevPAR basis from March 2020 through the end of 2021. Sonder’s outperformance vs. Traditional Urban Upper Upscale hotels for Occupancy Rate and RevPAR have narrowed from their peak during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as leisure travel demand has increased across all accommodation categories. Sonder defines Occupancy Rate as Occupied Nights (the total number of nights occupied across all Live Units) divided by Bookable Nights, expressed as a percentage; Bookable Nights consist of the total number of nights available for stays across all Live Units, excluding nights lost to full building closures greater than 30 nights. Traditional Hotels refers to the upper upscale class of hotels in cities where Sonder operates. The upper upscale chain segment designation is determined by STR (a globally recognized resource for market data on the worldwide hospitality industry) based on each hotel brand’s Average Daily Rate (revenue divided by Occupied Nights) for prior years.
The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus (including, for example, the Delta and Omicron variants), that may be more contagious or resistant to currently approved vaccines.
Industry Background and Market Opportunity 
Sonder’s Guests 
Sonder has served over one million guests since its inception. Our unique product portfolio serves a wide variety of use cases, from one night to extended stays, for various traveler types: leisure travelers, families, digital nomads and professionals. We believe our guest demographics will be a key driver to our future success, especially from those who value a digitally-driven experience and is focused on consistent, yet bespoke, modern and elevated stays at a compelling value. 
People travel for various purposes, including business and pleasure. As Sonder grows, we will strive to offer our customers a product and guest experience that serves all traveler segments and use cases. While leisure travel remains our core demographic, Sonder aims to expand this focus and drive incremental demand from business travel. 
Sonder’s Guest Experience 
Today, traditional hospitality continues to rely on antiquated services, with hotel operations slowly evolving to meet the needs of the modern traveler. The ubiquity of mobile devices provides an opportunity to modernize the traveler’s entire experience. Sonder has reimagined the guest journey, and is continuing its work towards this goal. 
•The bottleneck of the front desk can be bypassed entirely, and travelers can book, verify their account, and unlock their individual unit with only a few taps on Sonder’s app; 
•The inefficient concierge desk can be replaced by in-app curated local recommendations, and in-app messaging where nearly-instantaneous service is available 24/7; 
•Sub-par room service can be replaced by a partnership with food delivery companies that deliver fast, high quality local food from a variety of restaurants to guests’ rooms for a significantly lower price; 
Table of Contents

•The outdated taxi stand can be replaced by guests ordering transportation or finding open parking spots through potential in-app partnership integrations.
However, hospitality also needs to be human: the anticipation of guest needs, and warm personal touches that show care, consideration and an understanding that a travel experience is not limited to the four walls and furniture provided. Sonder provides guests with a modernized design-led experience unmet by traditional hospitality or other alternative accommodations players. 
Tech-Enabled Guest Journey 
Sonder’s app puts the “lobby on your phone” and empowers guests to seamlessly navigate their entire journey, from booking through check-out:
•Search, Discovery & Booking: Easy, intuitive browsing on Sonder’s recently updated app enables guests to seamlessly reserve and interact with the entire Sonder building portfolio. Guests can book any of our units through a variety of direct (e.g., Sonder.com, the Sonder app, or Sonder’s sales team) and indirect (e.g., Airbnb, Expedia, Booking.com and other Online Travel Agencies) channels. Our mobile-first guest experience, from check-in to check-out, is supported by the Sonder app, regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel. Guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with Sonder services and enhance their stay, but guests are not required to use the Sonder app to stay in a Sonder unit.
•Check-In: Guests can virtually check-in on their phone, completely bypassing the need for a front desk. Guests receive digital instructions and security access codes at the time of their stay, and can request and confirm an early check-in directly through the Sonder app. 
•One-Touch WiFi: In-app one-touch WiFi connects our guests easily to our speedy WiFi without memorizing long passwords or difficult network names. 
•Digital Concierge: Curated localized recommendations are available in-app at the touch of a button to help guests navigate the local flavor and experiences of each unique city and neighborhood. 
•Customer Service On Demand: App-based service requests and issue reporting connect Sonder guests with localized Sonder city teams ready to provide timely and curated assistance. 
•Check-out: Guests can instantly request and confirm a late check-out (subject to availability) directly through the Sonder app and find information regarding on and off premises bag storage. The simple app-based check-out process further engages guests by automatically following up with surveys and referral promotion codes.
Focus on Guest Satisfaction 
Sonder is hyper focused on providing the modern traveler a seamless experience and unique stay infused with creativity and culture. Sonder measures its guest satisfaction using customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores, which are defined as the percentage of guests surveyed who rated Sonder as a 5 on a scale of 1 (lowest satisfaction) to 5 (highest satisfaction). 
The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impact on Guests 
Despite the variety of travel restrictions around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, guests have continued to find a sense of home at Sonder. Sonder reacted with agility in order to keep its doors open and serve its guests, while complying with new local regulations to offer its guests clean and safe stays. At the height of lockdowns, many guests turned to Sonder as a result of its marketing campaign and outbound sales efforts to promote extended stays of 14 nights or longer. 
Examples of COVID-19 pandemic-related use cases include guests working from home, guests social distancing from roommates and family members, guests stranded away from home, and guests taking “staycations” 
Table of Contents

for a change of scenery. Sonder hosted healthcare professionals, stranded travelers and guests who just needed a little alone time. Sonder’s guests have expressed countless stories of their gratitude to not only have a clean and reliable place to stay, but also somewhere that felt like home in the midst of an incredibly trying time. As travel restrictions eased in certain markets, these previously discussed use cases have persisted, along with an increasing number of digital nomads, drive-to travelers and more. In an April/May 2020 post-stay survey conducted by Sonder, 72% of former Sonder guests who responded said they were more likely to choose Sonder over other branded hotels or other short-term rentals. 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sonder’s average Length of Stay (“LOS”) was approximately five nights. Sonder’s extended stay marketing initiative in response to the initial COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns drove average LOS up significantly to a peak of 14 nights in April 2020. Average LOS has subsequently decreased, reaching approximately five nights in the fourth quarter of 2021, and Sonder expects its LOS to remain at historical averages as the travel market recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, extended stays of 14 nights or longer will continue to be an important aspect of Sonder’s business, particularly if Sonder is able to generate extended stay demand in off-season markets (e.g., Montreal in winter, Dubai in summer). 
Demand Generation 
Sonder generates demand primarily through: 
•Third party online travel agencies (“OTAs”) such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, PlumGuide and TripAdvisor; and 
•Direct revenue on Sonder.com, generated organically.
Direct bookings were 45% of total booked revenue in full year 2021, which was mainly driven by: 
•Sonder’s first, modest investment in performance marketing, primarily through social media marketing; and 
•Sonder’s establishment of inbound and outbound sales efforts, focused on driving demand for extended stays of 14 nights or longer. 
Today, Sonder generates demand through the following sources, described in further detail in the subsections below: 
•Third-party OTAs such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, PlumGuide and TripAdvisor; 
•Direct revenue through Sonder.com or the Sonder app, driven by modest performance marketing and organic traffic; 
•Outbound and inbound sales focused on increasing group and business demand, which have not historically been meaningful revenue sources; and 
•Ancillary revenue generation.
Channel Strategy: OTA Expansion & Improvement 
Historically, our primary means of generating demand has been through online travel agencies (“OTAs”). OTAs, such as Airbnb, Expedia and Booking.com, are Internet-based marketplaces that allow consumers to research and book travel products and services, including hotels, alternative accommodations (e.g., apartment style temporary accommodations) and other travel-related services. We list our properties on these platforms where travelers can search for accommodations, and in turn we pay the OTAs a certain percentage channel fee when travelers book one of our units on the respective OTA platform.
Customers booking one of our units through an OTA will immediately see that their booking is with our property, clearly labeled with the Sonder brand, just as properties operated by other brands are similarly labeled with their brands. For example, a customer looking for accommodations in New York City on Expedia will see a variety of properties, both Sonder properties and properties operated by other hospitality brands. When the customer clicks 
Table of Contents

on an individual property to consider choosing it for their New York City trip, he or she will know it is a Sonder branded property, learn about the features of that property, see pictures of that property and see available inventory and prices for selected dates.
Today, the primary OTAs that travelers use to book our units are Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia, with 52% of 2021 booked revenue coming through these three channels. Guests who book their first stay with us through an OTA can later choose to book another stay with us through the same OTA, a different OTA, or directly from Sonder (e.g., Sonder.com, the Sonder app or Sonder’s sales team). Similarly, our guests who originally booked a Sonder unit directly from us may later choose to book a Sonder unit through an OTA. Regardless of whether a guest books their stay on Sonder.com or another channel, they are able to use the Sonder app to manage their stay and enhance their experience. All guests are encouraged to download and use the Sonder app to interact with Sonder services, but guests are not required to use the Sonder app to stay in a Sonder unit.
Some of the most important drivers of our success with OTA listings are reviews, ratings, badging, and photographs, which all contribute to guests being drawn to Sonder properties over other listings. Over the course of 2020, Sonder proactively focused on improving the quality of its OTA listings across these factors. We are also working to expand our presence onto additional OTAs, particularly those with a more international presence or a greater focus on hotel properties over apartments and other alternative accommodations. 
Driving Direct Booking Traffic 
While OTAs were historically Sonder’s primary source of demand, we saw a steady increase in direct booked revenue (revenue booked on Sonder.com or, since July 2020, on the Sonder app) as a percentage of total booked revenue from 12% in early 2018 to 45% in 2021. Before 2020, Sonder’s guest experience and differentiated offering drove direct booking traffic with minimal performance marketing spend, however, during 2020, Sonder began experimenting with performance marketing and extended stay discounts available on Sonder.com as a way to generate revenue during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sonder saw positive shifts to direct bookings as a result of these initiatives as noted above.. We continue to invest heavily in “bottom of the funnel” marketing, focusing on converting leads into purchases (e.g., social media marketing, search engine marketing), and improvements to Sonder.com with the aim of Sonder.com remaining our top channel of demand generation over the long term. 
In the future, we plan to expand our focus beyond leisure travelers to potentially new segments such as unmanaged business travel, leveraging both our current strategies while also expanding to influencer/content marketing, search engine optimization and other approaches that address the full customer journey. 
We are also in the early stages of developing an innovative loyalty / membership program to drive direct bookings and increase customer loyalty. In the meantime, we have explored other tactics to drive repeat behavior such as implementing a customer relationship management strategy and offering rewards and promotions for second stays. As Sonder continues to grow, loyal customers will be an extremely important driver of demand as we believe these customers will provide superior economics relative to first-time guests. Generally, repeat guests are less sensitive to price, more likely to buy add-on services, and have minimal to no customer acquisition cost. 
Building a Sales Team 
Sonder is in the process of building out its robust sales capabilities for both outbound sales (e.g., travel management companies, business-to-business sales to corporations) and inbound sales (e.g., servicing group travel such as corporate retreats or family reunions). This is a major area of opportunity for additional demand generation, as most hotels depend on business and group travel generated through a sales team. Our sales team will focus on driving additional group and business travel demand to complement the organic group and business travel that we already convert. Sonder has committed to building out this team after hiring several seasoned industry experts who understand how to capture the best of traditional hospitality, while leaving room for innovation in the areas where traditional hospitality has lagged. 
Table of Contents

Sonder is in the early stages of developing its sales function. Key areas of focus over the near- to medium-term include: 
•Attracting more business travelers for shorter stays by connecting with travel management companies (e.g., TripActions and Egencia) and business-to-business (“B2B”) negotiated rates with corporate clients. For a typical hotel, B2B travel on contracted B2B rates makes up approximately 10% to 15% of their demand mix, but currently makes up very little of Sonder’s demand, creating a huge opportunity for incremental revenue as Sonder will target all business travel, including group transient and corporate extended stay; and 
•Engaging Sonder’s inbound sales team on promising leisure and corporate group inquiries. Groups are a substantial revenue source for most hotels, representing another largely untapped growth opportunity for Sonder.
Ancillary Revenue Generation Opportunities 
We are beginning to explore opportunities to generate ancillary revenue, including charging for upgrades and our recently launched intra-stay cleaning for guests who prefer more frequent housekeeping services during their stay (the default option is that housekeeping services are only provided between stays). We also plan to explore other ways to continue providing value to and generating revenue from our guests. This could include services monetization (e.g., affiliate commissions from food delivery, parking, or rental cars), in-unit upgrades (e.g., a Peloton exercise bike in the room), and potentially selling items in Sonder units on behalf of retail partners. 
Data-Driven Revenue Management 
Revenue Management Today 
Sonder’s revenue management function is focused on utilizing analytics and data science to optimize for price and occupancy levels. Sonder’s revenue management team is comprised of data scientists, engineers, product managers and revenue managers whose key responsibilities include building a proprietary approach to revenue management that suits both Sonder’s apartments and hotels. This includes sophisticated software that enables Sonder revenue managers to set the best strategies on a market-by-market basis. To maximize revenue, Sonder has built pricing automation technology and a room attribution algorithm, which it uses to create competitive and dynamic prices, and to maximize the number of occupied Sonder units at all times. Sonder’s algorithmic approach also allows calendar shuffling within buildings to maximize availability, as well as dynamic pricing across varying Length of Stay. 
Future Revenue Management 
Sonder aims to continuously improve its revenue management capabilities in order to further optimize across its current and future demand segments. Today, there is no single revenue management solution on the market that offers an end to end approach across hotels to apartments. Sonder intends to innovate in this area, with a focus on: 
•Moving beyond heuristic based price recommendations to more robust data science driven approaches for forecasting demand, predicting elasticity and better informing price recommendations; 
•Continuing optimization work to target additional customer segments that span varying price points, channel costs, and loyalty characteristics; 
•Continuing to experiment in driving ancillary revenue; and 
•Launching features like attribute based pricing.
Sonder’s Properties 
Total Portfolio 
Sonder had over 7,600 Live Units across 38 markets and 10 countries, with approximately 10,500 additional Contracted Units, as of December 31, 2021. Sonder’s properties offer 1-, 2-, and 3+ bedroom and studio apartments, 
Table of Contents

many of which are furnished with in-unit washer and dryers and fully-stocked kitchens, as well as thoughtfully designed studio and 1-bedroom hotel rooms. 
As of December 31, 2021, Sonder’s five largest cities (New York City, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Dubai, and Montreal) accounted for over 35% of its Live Units, and its 10 largest cities accounted for approximately 60% of its Live Units. 
The majority of Sonder’s Total Portfolio consists of commercial or mixed use apartment developments where we operate the entire building or full floors within a building. For example, Sonder may lease entire buildings, which may range from fewer than ten-unit buildings in prime locations in trendy cities to large, multi-hundred-unit skyscrapers with great views in tourist destinations. If entire buildings are not available for Sonder to lease and operate as temporary accommodations, Sonder may lease and operate its business in portions of such buildings, such as full floors or multiple floors, alongside other, non-Sonder building tenants. However, a vast majority of Sonder’s recently signed properties are full buildings, and it intends to focus primarily on signing full building properties in the future. For instance, all of Sonder’s Live and Contracted hotel style properties are full buildings, and it intends to continue exclusively operating full buildings for its hotel style properties. Sonder apartments offer hotel style amenities (e.g., fast and free WiFi, toiletries, fresh towels, tea, coffee and kitchen essentials) in some of the most traveled cities in the world.
A smaller, but growing proportion of Sonder’s portfolio consists of hotels where we have partnered with independent, unbranded hotel property owners to convert existing properties into Sonder-branded hotels, putting a modern spin on the traditional hotel, with inspiring design and tech-enabled service. We believe hotels will make up a more substantial percentage of our portfolio by the end of 2022.
In the future, we may add various types of properties to our portfolio, including resorts, and eventually other accommodation categories. We believe all categories can benefit from better design, modern service and technology that eliminates inefficiencies.
Sonder Leases 
Sonder signs multi-year fixed leases, mixed leases, or revenue share agreements as the anchor or sole tenant in existing buildings and development projects. Prior to 2020, nearly all of Sonder’s leases were Fixed Leases, whereby Sonder agrees to a fixed periodic fee per unit, and Fixed Leases continue to represent the vast majority of Sonder’s contracts with real estate owners. We also offer flexible contract structures to landlords, including Mixed Lease structures (whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a minimum fixed periodic fee, plus a certain share of property revenue, typically with a capped periodic amount) and Revenue Share agreements (whereby we agree to pay the real estate owner a variable fee based on certain revenue related metrics as specified in the agreement, rather than a fixed periodic fee). 
Our typical property lease has a 5 to 7 year initial term, with up to two 5-year renewals at Sonder’s option. Sonder leases commonly include upfront rent abatement to offset the initial setup costs and revenue ramp for new units. We also typically structure our leases to include downside protections, including partial rent relief in the event of a recession, and frequently include clauses designed to limit the effects of unfavorable market movements, regulatory changes, and force majeure events.
Additionally, in the vast majority of our leases, we are able to negotiate an upfront allowance paid by the real estate owner to help offset the capital invested to prepare and furnish a building and the individual units. Sonder is able to negotiate these allowances by offering real estate owners a higher expected yield on their investment compared to a deal without an allowance. Effectively, Sonder is compensating real estate owners for providing “furnished” units. By agreeing to such terms, real estate owners are able to generate higher than expected cash flows from units while also allowing Sonder to begin operations with much less upfront capital invested. Deals signed from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2021 had on average over 80% real estate owner funded capital expenditure.

Supply Growth 
Supply growth—the expansion of Sonder’s portfolio of global properties—is a major driver of its expected revenue growth over the next several years. As of December 31, 2021, Sonder has scaled its business to a Total Portfolio of approximately 18,100 Live and Contracted Units across both apartments and hotels. 
Real Estate Team 
Sonder’s real estate team consists of distributed business development professionals (“BDs”) managed on a regional level, along with a central team which provides infrastructure (e.g., systems, data, marketing, training) and support. BDs are responsible for signing deals to expand their market’s Total Portfolio, and can be leveraged across multiple markets if one market does not provide the depth of supply to require full-time support. Markets can also have more than one BD depending on size and supply of opportunities. This allows the real estate team a degree of flexibility to optimally staff the highest growth opportunities within each region. 
New Market Identification 
Sonder evaluates new market launches based on a variety of criteria: 
•Demand: Estimate traveler demand (annual nightly stays/visitors), sources of demand and distribution channels, core demand drivers, guest segmentation (leisure vs. business), demand at various RevPAR tiers, and market saturation. 
•Supply availability: Assess the number of Class A apartment projects in downtown core areas and desirable neighborhoods that will be delivered in the coming years, and the total independent hotel units available in those neighborhoods. 
•Regulations: Understand the path to licensing and legally operating apartments and/or hotels. 
•Unit economics: Utilize market rents and RevPARs to understand expected property level profit margins and payback periods on the average apartment and/or hotel deal. 
•Brand value: Assess whether entrance into a new market will improve the desirability of Sonder as a global brand and attract new guests. 
•Synergies: Triangulate proximity to other Sonder markets; understand potential to leverage overhead resources across multiple markets, but minimize risk of traveler demand cannibalization between new and existing markets.
Target Identification 
Sonder utilizes a variety of tactics to source its real estate transactions. Each BD leverages their local network of developers, property investors and owner-operators, and in some cases, leverages in-market brokers to identify projects of interest. We also use databases and listings to identify apartment developments in the planning or mid-construction/renovation stages and hotel opportunities. Sonder engages in marketing efforts (e.g., real estate newsletters and industry events) to drive inbound partnership inquiries from real estate owners, which have in turn driven a growing number of repeat real estate owners leasing to Sonder. 
Transaction Process 
Sonder BDs interface directly with real estate owners to pitch Sonder’s value proposition, agree to terms that are memorialized in a Letter of Intent (“LOI”), and negotiate the finer details of the deal with the support of Sonder’s centralized legal team. Sonder has built a series of checks and balances into its process in an attempt to secure high quality deals from both a financial/risk and brand perspective. Each signed deal goes through a rigorous 4-step review process beginning pre-LOI submission and continuing through final deal execution: 
•Brand Review Committee: Sonder is striving to cultivate a world of choice for our guests, but is also committed to building a better brand. The Brand Review Committee (“BRC”) evaluates new properties

from a brand perspective, focusing on location and modern design; it reviews location, building layout, unit concentration, arrival experience, access, signage, guest services, amenities and co-tenancy. The BRC aims to ensure each property Sonder signs will enable it to deliver a great guest experience designed to inspire. Sonder’s Chief Executive Officer, Global Head of Real Estate and VP of Real Estate Development sit on the BRC. 
•Underwriting: Once a deal passes BRC review, it undergoes our rigorous underwriting process. This includes a forward-looking projection model, comparable property analysis, comprehensive cash flow projections, scenario modeling and payback period analysis. Sonder’s investment analysis (“IA”) team creates its view of underwriting (independent from the views of the city / real estate teams negotiating the deals), with a detailed analysis of comparable properties in the neighborhood and adjustments for property-specific attributes. The IA team runs multiple scenarios for each deal, with the goal of adequately considering the likelihood and potential impact of downside scenarios. 
•Financial Review Committee: The finalized underwriting model is reviewed by the Financial Review Committee (“FRC”) to independently evaluate the risk profile of each deal, and the potential impact on Sonder’s overall portfolio. The FRC reviews each deal to assess deal quality, confirms that deal terms / forecasted economics meet Sonder’s target hurdle rates, suggests alternative deal structures if not already considered and approves LOIs before submission. Sonder’s President and Chief Financial Officer, Global Head of Real Estate and Regional Head of Real Estate (Americas or EMEA) sit on the FRC. 
•Final Diligence Review: Sonder has established a robust due diligence function that ensures alignment between the real estate, finance, legal, operations, real estate development and brand teams. It also established a final deal review process to sign off on final deal terms and negotiated lease provisions, including any changes from LOI to final agreement, before signing a contract.
Process for Units Going Live 
Every signed lease has an agreed upon Takeover Date, the date on which Sonder receives the keys and is able to begin opening the building (e.g., moving in furniture, staging / photographing units for listing). The length of time between the Contracted Date (the date on which a new real estate contract is signed by all parties) and the Takeover Date is referred to as the Lead Time. This is the period during which Sonder does not pay rent and does not generate revenue, but has a contractual commitment from the real estate owner(s) that Sonder will receive the keys for the building once it is ready. 
Lead Times vary depending on product type (apartment vs. hotel) and stage of development. Historically, a majority of Sonder’s apartment properties have been signed while in the development phase; however, Sonder’s recent signings have trended more towards apartment properties under construction and nearing delivery. In these cases, Lead Times are driven by construction timelines, which could be one to three years depending on the development stage when Sonder signs the deal, the developer’s success in obtaining necessary permits and financing, and other factors. In contrast, hotels have relatively short Lead Times (a few months on average) because hotel deals are typically existing operating properties, sometimes with the only renovation being minor updating work. 
When the real estate owner notifies Sonder that the premises are ready to be delivered in the condition required under the lease, Sonder’s legal team works closely with Sonder’s local city team to verify that all delivery conditions have been satisfied. To the extent delivery conditions are outstanding, Sonder works with the real estate owner to ensure all items are complete prior to acceptance of the keys on the Takeover Date. 
Once Sonder receives the keys from the real estate owner, it then commences the building opening process in order to prepare the building for guests. If the building opening process cannot be completed prior to the Takeover Date, Sonder experiences an Opening Period, a period in which Sonder is paying rent (or utilizing prenegotiated abatement) but is not yet able to generate revenue from the building. Sonder focuses on operational and technology-driven improvements to reduce its Opening Period, including its global supply chain to furnish and equip its spaces at a high quality level and in a short amount of time. Once the building opening process is complete, a unit is

considered live, which means it is listed on Sonder.com, the Sonder app and OTA websites, and is open for guest bookings. 
Supply Growth Strategy 
In the short-term, Sonder will focus its supply growth efforts primarily on existing markets where it has existing Live Units or Contracted Units. Sonder has spent the last several years building the infrastructure and relationships with real estate owners in these markets, and believes that there is significant opportunity for further expansion within these geographies. 
A Passion for Design 
A belief in the power of design is central to Sonder’s mission. We see design as a verb, not just a noun: encompassing how something works and feels, not just how it looks. Sonder has built an entire organization of designers: people, skills, disciplines, and decision makers who care about the design behind every detail in a great stay—from operations technology to the guest-facing app to the spaces it offers. 
We take pride in the spaces and experiences we bring to life through our interdisciplinary teams and external partnerships spanning architecture, product and service design, graphic communications, copywriting, and more. 
Design Partnerships 
Sonder cares deeply about artistry. We celebrate the creators and makers around Sonder—the exceptional ones who see the art in everything and never settle for ordinary. As Sonder looks to the future, we plan to collaborate with more local architects, artisans, designers and craftspeople. Sonder is focused on bringing its passion for design and creativity to its guests, with a focus on celebrating the local communities in each Sonder city. 
Operations 
While the Sonder guest experience is tech-enabled, it is also powered by Sonder’s operations teams (located both on-the-ground in local markets and centrally at Sonder’s headquarters) focused on efficiently and effectively opening new Sonder buildings, providing best practice playbooks for ongoing operations and serving our guests. 
Operations Team 
On-the-ground teams are mainly composed of service staff, with leadership in the form of city-level and regional General Managers to achieve a high-quality guest experience and a rapid pace of new building openings. Central teams include those focused on supply chain, interior design, real estate development, guest service and operational excellence. 
Supply Chain 
In the Americas, Sonder has built a streamlined global supply chain powered by proprietary warehouse and inventory management technology. This enables lean operations while supporting rapid expansion. Furniture, art, decor, linens and other guest facing items are curated by Sonder’s centralized sourcing and merchandising team, and sourced from top international and domestic vendors. Sonder focuses on ensuring that furniture adheres to a high grade of quality and reliability while retaining aesthetic appeal, and expects its suppliers to abide by its Supplier Code of Conduct (which is informed by internationally recognized social, environmental, and ethical standards). These products are stored in central warehouses, allowing for quick turnaround times and distribution to enable rapid building openings. 
In Europe and the Middle East, Sonder works with local providers to deliver a similar aesthetic and grade of product to deliver a high-quality guest experience, brand consistency, and fast deployment. 
Building Openings 
Sonder’s global infrastructure and highly experienced on-the-ground teams allow it to onboard new properties quickly and efficiently. In North America, once a project has been signed and designed, any necessary furniture and

decor items are shipped from central distribution centers to local city warehouses before being delivered to each building all at once as a full “hotel in a box.” In Europe and the Middle East, Sonder works with local providers to deliver a similar end product. Sonder’s local city building opening teams ensure that the spaces are immaculately set up and well-photographed before welcoming its first guests. 
Day-to-Day Operations 
Sonder’s day-to-day operations are delivered by central and locally based teams, powered by a combination of proprietary and third party software. 
Sonder’s central customer care team and locally based service teams work hand-in-hand to address guests’ inquiries, issues, and requests quickly and effectively. Sonder’s central customer care team has hubs in North America, Europe and Asia. 
Back-of-house teams such as housekeeping — both Sonder-employed and third party providers—use proprietary software to deliver incredible, spotlessly clean spaces and resolve any guest issues or requests that might arise. 
Competition 
Given the nature of Sonder’s business model, it operates in two highly competitive environments: (i) attracting guests and (ii) securing desirable real estate supply. 
Competition for Guests 
Travelers are faced with many options as they search for a stay that best suits their needs. Sonder competes for guests based on many factors, including the location and quality of accommodations, property amenities, reputation for guest services and guest-facing technologies, pricing and brand loyalty. Within traditional hospitality, Sonder competes primarily with major incumbent operators in the upscale and upper upscale hotel segments, such as Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt, who have built their brands and customer loyalty over several decades. Sonder also competes against boutique hotel operators and smaller hotel chains, particularly in non-U.S. markets. 
Guests are increasingly shifting their hospitality spend to alternative accommodation providers that offer differentiated home-like experiences at price points below that of traditional hotels. Within alternative accommodations, Sonder is, by far, the largest branded operator. Many of our direct venture-backed competitors in this space have relatively limited operations in a small number of markets. The alternative accommodation space also includes the likes of Airbnb, Vrbo (owned by Expedia Group), and various large Internet-based companies that advertise hotel rooms and other travel services. Sonder considers OTAs an important channel partner, with OTAs accounting for approximately 50% of total revenue in 2020. 
Competition for Real Estate Supply 
Sonder competes against various parties for new buildings in order to increase its Total Portfolio size. On the apartment side, Sonder competes against other leasing styles (e.g., traditional lease-up to 12-month term tenants) as well as other short-term rental companies with similar business models to its own, albeit on a smaller scale and in fewer markets. On the hotel side, Sonder primarily competes against traditional hotel property managers. 
However, we believe we offer a compelling value proposition to the developers and owners of apartments and hotels. Sonder provides apartment developers superior economics by eliminating lengthy lease-up periods, minimizing sales and marketing costs, and removing many daily operational burdens. For independent, unbranded hotel owners, Sonder applies its technology, design, and brand to improve the top and bottom-line performance of the property, offering owners a steady stream of income while taking the operational headaches off their hands. Sonder has entrenched itself as the preferred counterparty of many of its partners due to its scaled operations and proven track record. Sonder’s commitment to collaboration with real estate owners creates a differentiated outcome for all stakeholders.

Regulatory Compliance 
Sonder’s strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance as its operations are subject to regulations in the following principal areas, across a wide variety of jurisdictions. 
Property and Accommodations Regulation 
Sonder’s business is subject to U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws and regulations that vary widely by city, country and property type. In many cities, local regulations affect Sonder’s ability to offer accommodations for specified durations or in certain neighborhoods. Hospitality and transient accommodations operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws and regulations relating to accessibility, and to laws, regulations and standards in other areas such as zoning and land use, licensing, permitting and registrations, fire and life safety, environmental and other property condition matters, staffing and employee training, cleaning protocols and other COVID-19 requirements, and property “star” ratings where required. Additionally, Sonder’s real estate owners are also responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, property maintenance and operations, environmental laws and other matters. 
Before signing any new leases in a new market, Sonder engages local legal counsel to help identify relevant regulatory requirements. This research includes analysis on licensing and zoning, building code, accessibility and operations requirements, fire and life safety regulations, tax compliance, and local employment laws. Every leased property has unique characteristics, requiring further due diligence and regulatory analysis before each new lease signing. 
Sonder monitors regulatory changes in each existing market on an ongoing basis. To facilitate its growth and compliance work in each city, Sonder also proactively establishes relationships with local regulatory agencies, elected officials, business and community groups to build trust and improve understanding of Sonder’s business model. 
Privacy and Data Protection Regulation 
In processing travel transactions and information about guests and their stays, Sonder receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure and protection of this information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. States and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Act. 
Sonder takes a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data, including data pertaining to guests and employees, and Sonder is engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act, GDPR, PIPEDA, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and UK Data Protection Act. 
Employment 
Sonder is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration, workplace safety and health, and hotel-specific ordinances. 
Other Regulation 
Sonder’s business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. As Sonder expands into additional markets, it will be subject to additional laws and regulations.

The regulatory environment in each market is often complex and evolving, and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent and ambiguous, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect Sonder’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to an innovative hospitality provider such as Sonder, which often makes their application to Sonder’s business uncertain. For additional information regarding the laws and regulations that affect Sonder’s business, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
In 2020, Sonder established a dedicated Sustainability, Partnerships and Social Impact function that supports, advises and provides best practices on ESG across the organization. As a rapidly expanding business, Sonder understands the importance of adopting responsible business practices and has taken deliberate steps to consider integrating crucial aspects into its business and how it will measure and transparently report ESG information to investors in the future. 
Sonder’s ESG goal is to foster the social, environmental and economic well-being of the communities it calls home. To do this, Sonder is developing initiatives, setting targets and forming partnerships through its People, Place and Planet framework. Together these three pillars illustrate Sonder’s commitment to its employees and guests, to the communities in which it operates, and to minimizing its environmental footprint. 
Over this ramping up period, we have established or begun developing best practices across our three pillars including:

•Developing and publishing core corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies, i.e. Modern Slavery Act Statement; Supplier Code of Conduct; DEI Statement; and a Zero Tolerance policy reflected in our Sonder House Rules.
•Establishing a voting policy granting time-off to our employees to allow them to engage in local U.S. elections.
•Establishing seven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Blackout; SonderSisters; LGBTQIA+; Visible; Sustainability; Unidos; and SonderVeterans.

Sonder Employees & Culture 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2021, Sonder had approximately 1,200 employees across 20 states in the U.S., and approximately 300 employees located in 10 countries outside of the United States and approximately 100 remote workers. Sonder’s workforce consisted of approximately 800 salaried and approximately 800 hourly employees as of that date. Certain non-U.S. employees are currently represented by unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Culture 
Sonder’s people philosophy is to create a workplace where everyone can thrive. 
Sonder’s culture is defined by ten leadership principles, designed to ignite more innovation, and in many ways to combat the very natural but detrimental impulses of organizations as they scale. Sonder’s leadership principles allow us to move quickly and strategically, to stay inspired and coordinated, and to help Sonder challenge the status quo. It is our hope that as we scale, the organization will become faster, more inspiring, and a better place to work. In short, better. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Extending hospitality to all is one of Sonder’s leadership principles. Living up to that principle means fully embracing diversity - - ensuring that all of our employees, guests, partners, and communities feel safe, respected, included, cared for, and empowered. 
Sonder is resolute against hate. In accordance with our non-discrimination and harassment policy, we have zero tolerance for racism, sexism, discrimination, intimidation, or violence of any kind. 
An important part of Sonder’s business mission is a never-ending pursuit to make things better. We are in the early stages of our DEI work as a company. Though we have much to do, we have taken the initial steps to create a DEI working group to listen to and to engage employees. This team will guide our work, including setting clear goals in order to better evaluate progress as we grow. We have established seven ERGs: Blackout; SonderSisters; LGBTQIA+; Visible; Sustainability; Unidos; and SonderVeterans.
Intellectual Property 
Sonder relies on trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions, and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect its proprietary rights. 
As of December 31, 2021, Sonder had 105 trademark registrations and pending applications, including registrations for “Sonder” in the United States, Canada and various other countries, applications and registrations for the Sonder bird logo in 352 countries, and an application for “Sonder” (and bird logo) and two applications for “SONDER in Chinese Characters” in China. 
Table of Contents

In addition to trademark protection, Sonder reserves and registers domain names when and where deemed appropriate and is the registered holder of more than 80 domain names, including “sonder.com.” 
In addition to the protection provided by its intellectual property rights, Sonder enters into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with certain of its employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Certain employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. Sonder further controls the use of its proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in its terms of use on its website and guest app.
