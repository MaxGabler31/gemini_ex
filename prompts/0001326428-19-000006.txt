ITEM 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
Organization
Our predecessor, Roan LLC, was initially formed by Citizen in May 2017. In June 2017, subsidiaries of Old Linn, together with Citizen and Roan LLC entered into the Contribution, pursuant to which, among other things, Old Linn and Citizen agreed to contribute certain oil and natural gas assets to Roan LLC, each in exchange for a 50% equity interest in Roan LLC. On August 31, 2017, Old Linn and Citizen consummated the transactions contemplated by such contribution agreement. Following these transactions, Citizen’s equity interest in Roan LLC was held through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Roan Holdings.
In the third quarter of 2018, Old Linn and certain of its subsidiaries undertook an internal reorganization, pursuant to which Old Linn merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Linn. Following such internal reorganization, New Linn completed the spin-off of substantially all of its assets, other than its 50% equity interest in Roan LLC.
On September 17, 2018, New Linn, Roan Holdings and Roan LLC entered into a master reorganization agreement, to effectuate the reorganization of New Linn’s and Roan Holdings’ respective 50% equity interests in Roan LLC under Roan Inc. On September 24, 2018, the Company consummated the Reorganization, which resulted in the existing stockholders of New Linn receiving 50% of the Class A common stock of the Company and Roan Holdings receiving 50% of the Class A common stock of the Company. In connection with the Reorganization, the Company became the owner, indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, of 100% of the equity in, and is the sole manager of, Roan LLC. The Company is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Roan LLC’s business.
Roan Inc. was incorporated in September 2018 to serve as a holding company and, prior to our reorganization, had no previous operations, assets or liabilities. Unless otherwise indicated, the historical financial, reserve and operational information presented in this Annual Report (i) on and after September 24, 2018, is that of Roan Inc., and (ii) prior to September 24, 2018, is that of Roan LLC, our predecessor. The historical financial and operational information of Roan LLC presented in this Annual Report, (i) prior to August 31, 2017, the date of the completion of the Contribution (as defined herein), is that of Citizen, the predecessor of Roan LLC for financial reporting purposes and (ii) on and after August 31, 2017, is that of Roan LLC. Therefore, the historical financial and operating information of Citizen prior to August 31, 2017 does not include financial information relating to certain oil and natural gas assets contributed to Roan LLC by subsidiaries of Old Linn.
On November 9, 2018, the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ROAN.”
Overview
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the development of our assets throughout the eastern and southern Anadarko Basin. We focus our development on formations where we believe we can apply our technical and operational expertise in order to increase production and cash flow.
1

Through December 31, 2018, we and our predecessors have drilled 214 gross (72 net) wells in the Merge, SCOOP, and STACK plays. Our acreage position is concentrated in areas that we believe demonstrate higher percentage production of oil and NGLs, and provides us development opportunities through multiple stacked prospective development horizons. We believe these development horizons have been substantially de‑risked through the development of more than 400 horizontal wells since early 2014, of which 152 were drilled by us or our predecessors, and over 4,450 vertical wells drilled in our development area, as well as associated subsurface data, including well cores and logs and 3-D seismic and the consistent geology surrounding our position. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 163 gross (131 net) horizontal producing wells and had an interest in an additional 317 gross (19 net) horizontal producing wells.
As of December 31, 2018, we held leasehold interests in approximately 383,000 gross (172,000 net) acres in the Anadarko Basin. At December 31, 2018, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 305,959 MBoe. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, our average net daily production was 54.1 MBoe/ d (approximately 27% oil, 42% natural gas and 31% NGLs).
Our Business Strategies
Our primary objective is to maximize shareholder value across business cycles by pursuing the following strategies:

• | Generate attractive full-cycle returns through the efficient development of our extensive, low‑risk drilling inventory. We intend to efficiently achieve industry leading rates of return by leveraging the scale of our core leasehold positions, experience from the success of our drilling program to date, technical understanding of the reservoirs, our extensive catalogue of technical information and experience of our operational teams. We intend to allocate capital in a disciplined manner to projects that we believe will produce predictable and attractive full-cycle rates of return.


• | Maximize value of our asset base through constant focus on improving operating, production and capital efficiencies. We utilize proprietary data analytics, combined with operational procedures and metrics, to evaluate well results and adjust drilling and production techniques in real time. We use this framework in an effort to maximize hydrocarbon recoveries per well by optimizing location selection, wellbore targeting, well completion designs and production techniques. Additionally, we seek to reduce capital and operating costs of drilling and completing horizontal wells by decreasing development cycle times, optimizing the use of surface facilities, capitalizing on our knowledge of the target formations and focusing on service cost management practices.


• | Maintain a high degree of operational control to facilitate efficient development and capital budgeting. We seek to maintain operational control of our properties in order to better execute on our strategy of enhancing returns through operational improvements and cost efficiencies. As of December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 71% of our total acreage. We believe that maintaining a high degree of control of the development of our properties and of our production enables us to increase hydrocarbon recovery rates, lower capital and operating costs and improve drilling performance through optimization of our drilling, completion and production management techniques. Additionally, we believe operatorship allows us to control wellsite selection, spacing and lateral targeting and manage the pace of our development activities, which we believe can significantly enhance full-cycle returns.

• | Maintain a disciplined, returns-driven strategy with a focus on maintaining financial flexibility. We intend to maintain a conservative financial profile that will afford us flexibility through the commodity price and capital market cycles inherent in the oil and natural gas industry. We intend to generate stable production and reserves growth by funding our development program primarily with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and capital markets offerings.


• | Selectively pursue opportunities to augment our asset base through the disciplined acquisition or leasing of oil and natural gas properties. As one of the most active operators in Oklahoma, we believe we are well positioned to selectively pursue accretive consolidation opportunities. We believe the strength of our operational program provides a competitive advantage in the pursuit of such opportunities. We will continue to identify and evaluate acquisition and leasing opportunities around and within our concentrated acreage position, as well as other areas in Oklahoma, that meet our strategic and financial objectives.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths will allow us to successfully execute on our business strategies:

• | Large, contiguous acreage position in the core of the Merge play with significant operational control. We are the largest leaseholder in the Merge play, with approximately 115,000 net acres as of December 31, 2018. We believe that the scale and concentration of our acreage position allows for efficient field development through long laterals and shared facilities, with approximately 80% of our Merge sections capable of 1.5 mile or longer lateral development. Additionally, our acreage position is concentrated in areas that we believe demonstrate higher percentage production of oil and NGLs within the Merge play, and provides us development opportunities through multiple stacked prospective development horizons. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 81% of our net acreage in the Merge and we intend to maintain operational control over the majority of our drilling inventory, as we believe this enables us to increase our production and reserves and control our development costs, and ultimately increase shareholder value.


• | Long-lived inventory of locations with predictable production profiles that provide high rate-of-return development opportunities. Through the drilling of 163 operated horizontal wells and participation in 317 non-operated horizontal wells across our acreage, we have substantially delineated our acreage and have acquired significant amounts of subsurface information. Based on this delineation and general industry Merge, SCOOP and STACK well production history, we believe that our acreage position will provide a large portfolio of drilling locations characterized by long-lived reserves, predictable production profiles and attractive return potential.


• | Geographically advantaged assets with significant available midstream infrastructure and favorable regulatory climate. Our acreage position is in close proximity or has available access to end markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs, providing us with a regional price advantage relative to other U.S. onshore oil-weighted basins. For example, our realized oil price differential to NYMEX WTI average prices in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.67 per barrel compared to a WTI-Midland oil price differential to NYMEX WTI average prices in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.29 per barrel. Oklahoma has a long history of oil and natural gas production, and therefore there is existing midstream infrastructure in place across our acreage position to support our drilling program. In addition, we believe that oilfield services availability is greater in our focus area than in other major U.S. onshore basins and that such availability is a competitive advantage in assuring the ability to access necessary development services at attractive pricing.

• | Experienced operations leadership with substantial technical expertise. We believe our operational management team provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. Our team has significant experience working together throughout the Mid-Continent and evaluating the Merge play in particular. Collectively, our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President - Operations and Marketing, Executive Vice President - Geosciences and Business Development and members of our operations management team have over 90 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry and have been involved in drilling over 1,000 horizontal wells across multiple plays in the lower 48 states. We believe their experience is instrumental in the execution of our pursuit of operational and capital efficiencies.


• | Significant financial strength and flexibility. We believe we have a strong financial position, including a low debt profile and a large production base that generates significant cash flow, allowing us to strategically allocate capital in order to enhance shareholder value. We are well-positioned to adjust our development program based on market and industry conditions, as we have minimal commitments to deliver specified volumes, no rig contracts extending beyond 12 months and approximately 84% of our acreage is HBP as of December 31, 2018. We believe that our conservative capital structure, which we will seek to maintain through a disciplined approach to capital spending, and other potential financing sources will provide us with sufficient liquidity and flexibility to execute our development capital program.

Our Properties
We own leasehold interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. The Anadarko Basin, which spans from south-central Oklahoma to the northeast corner of the Texas panhandle, is one of the largest and most prolific onshore oil and natural gas basins in the United States, featuring multiple producing horizons and extensive well production history demonstrated over seven decades of development. We focus our development on formations where we believe we can apply our technical and operational expertise in order to increase production and cash flow to deliver compelling economic rates of return on a risk adjusted basis. Given the long productive history in these areas, there is substantial midstream and service infrastructure in place, including natural gas and NGL pipelines and natural gas processing plants. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had assembled a total leasehold position of approximately 172,000 net acres, which is predominantly concentrated in the Merge and SCOOP plays. In addition to the subsurface benefits of our position, we believe our acreage position benefits from the following characteristics:

• | High Degree of Operational Control. We expect that we will be able to control operations on approximately 71% of our acreage in the Merge, SCOOP and STACK plays. For these purposes, we have assumed that we will control any unit in which we have leased a minimum of 37.5% of the acreage in the unit. Operational control of our leasehold positions allows us to control the development and production methods, as well as the pace of development on our wells.


• | Contiguous Acreage Position. A substantial portion of the sections in which we have operational control are offset to the north or south by adjacent controlled sections. Specifically, approximately 66% of our sections in the Merge, SCOOP and STACK plays can be developed on a multi-unit basis. As a result, we are able to develop long lateral horizontal wells for the majority of our drilling program, which we believe have exhibited superior economics as compared to shorter laterals as a result of development cost efficiencies.

4


• | Largely Held-by-Production. Approximately 84% of our total acreage position was HBP as of December 31, 2018. We expect this high percentage of HBP acreage to enhance capital efficiencies in our development program, as we will pursue development locations with the favorable risk-adjusted rates of return in our location selection process, as opposed to selecting locations in order to hold acreage.

We refer to gross and net acreage where we are designated as operator or expect to be designated as operator based on the size of our working interest relative to other working interest owners as “our operated acreage” or acreage we “operated” in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 71% of our net acreage and had an average working interest of approximately 70% in all of our operated acreage. From January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we drilled or participated in 214 gross horizontal wells that had first sales as of December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 84% of our total net acreage was held by production. This positions us to control the pace of our development efforts, strategically develop our acreage with a near-term focus on high-return projects, limit expenditures on lease renewals and limit the risk of losing high quality acreage through expiration of leases. Additionally, we closely monitor activity of other industry participants and adjust our future development plans based on information and what we believe to be best practices learned from our peers.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average net daily production was 43.7 MBoe/d (approximately 27% oil, 44% natural gas and 29% NGLs). During 2017, our average net daily production was 16.2 MBoe/d (approximately 25% oil, 49% natural gas and 26% NGLs). As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,263 gross (502 net) producing wells online, operated and non-operated.
Our Drilling Program and Completion Techniques
We intend to target accretive growth in production and cash flow by developing and expanding our significant portfolio of drilling locations. We believe that our recent well results demonstrate that many of our development projects are capable of producing attractive rates of return that are competitive with many of the top performing basins in the United States. We are focused on drilling wells with high rates of return, repeatable production profiles and increasing estimated ultimate recoveries while at the same time seeking to capitalize on drilling, completion and operating efficiencies. Our management team assumed operation of our properties in the first half of 2018 and has achieved meaningful operational advancements, including (i) improvement in lateral targeting, (ii) reductions in development cycle times, (iii) optimization testing of well completion methods, (iv) well flowback management, and (v) expanded subsurface data coverage, including 3-D seismic.
Oil and Natural Gas Data
Proved Reserves
Evaluation of Proved Reserves. Approximately 93% of our proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 were prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers. Our personnel prepared reserve estimates with respect to the remaining approximate 7% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018.

DeGolyer and MacNaughton is a petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1936. Within DeGolyer and MacNaughton, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing our reserves estimates was Gregory K. Graves, P.E. Mr. Graves is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 70734), is a member of both the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and has in excess of 35 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. Mr. Graves graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering.
Mr. Graves meets the requirements with regard to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the SPE.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton does not own an interest in any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. A copy of DeGolyer and MacNaughton’s proved reserve report as of December 31, 2018 is included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves. Our internal technical team members meet with our independent reserve engineers periodically to review properties and to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. Our Corporate Reserves Advisor, who is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, holds a Bachelor of Science in petroleum engineering technology, has over 25 years of industry experience and over 10 years of experience in corporate reserves preparation. Additionally, our Reservoir Engineering Manager, who assists our Corporate Reserves Advisor in the reserve preparation process, has 13 years of industry experience in reserve estimation and petroleum economics. Our Reservoir Engineering Manager holds a Bachelor of Science in engineering and geology as well as a Master of Business Administration degree. They are supported by a staff of 8 professionals with an average industry experience of 10 years, all of whom hold a Bachelor degree or higher.
The preparation of our proved reserve estimates was completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following:

• | review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by us;


• | review of reserve estimates by our Reservoir Engineering Manager or under his direct supervision;


• | review by our Executive Vice President—Operations and Marketing of all of our reported proved reserves, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new PUDs additions;


• | review by our management team of reported proved reserves and significant reserve changes;


• | direct reporting responsibilities by our Reservoir Engineering Manager to our Executive Vice President—Operations and Marketing; and


• | verification of property ownership by our land department.

Estimation of Proved Reserves. Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing

the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into four broad categories or methods: (i) production performance-based methods; (ii) material balance-based methods; (iii) volumetric-based methods; and (iv) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods for the vast majority of properties. Certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to similar production, both of which are considered to provide a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Non-producing reserve estimates, for developed and undeveloped properties, were forecast using analogy methods. This method provides a reasonably high degree of accuracy for predicting PDNP and PUD reserves for our properties, due to the abundance of analog data.
To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, we considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates.
Under SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data.

(1) | Totals may not sum or recalculate due to rounding.


(2) | Our estimated net proved reserves were determined using average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC guidance adjusted for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials, and in the case of natural gas, energy content. For oil and NGLs volumes, the average WTI posted price of $65.66 per barrel as of December 31, 2018, was adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of $3.16 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2018 was similarly adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are $64.49 per barrel of oil, $20.35 per barrel of NGLs and $1.90 per Mcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2018.


(3) | Please see “Risk Factors— The standardized measure of our estimated reserves contained in this Annual Report and in the footnotes to our financial statements is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated reserves.”


(4) | PV-10 is not a financial measure calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. The following table reconciles the GAAP standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):


Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 1,699,701
Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% | 391,808 | 
PV-10 of proved reserves | $ | 2,091,509

Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please see “Risk Factors” appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Additional information regarding our proved reserves can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in the reserve report of DeGolyer and MacNaughton as of December 31, 2018, which is included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
PUDs
As of December 31, 2018, our PUDs totaled 37,031 MBbls of oil, 541,505 MMcf of natural gas and 58,485 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 185,767 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells are drilled and begin production.
The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs during the year ended December 31, 2018 (in MBoe):

Balance, December 31, 2017 | 151,724 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 127,804 | 
Revisions of previous estimates | (67,260 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (26,501 | )
Balance, December 31, 2018 | 185,767 | 

Extensions and discoveries of 127,804 MBoe during the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted primarily from proved undeveloped locations added as a result of the continued development of our acreage and the drilling activity of other operators in the area. Downward revisions of previous estimates of 67,260 MBoe during the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily due to adjustments to unit spacing, wellbore lateral length and other factors as we refined our current development plan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $119.8 million to convert 26,501 MBoe to proved developed producing reserves.
Our estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs at December 31, 2018 are projected to be approximately $1.2 billion over the next five years, which we expect to finance through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and other sources of capital. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial booking. Please see “Risk Factors—The development of our estimated PUDs may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated PUDs may not be ultimately developed or produced.”
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 21,930 MBoe of our total proved reserves relating to 33 drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) were classified as PUDs, which is reflected in proved undeveloped reserves above. These DUCs are all scheduled to be completed within the next six months and have remaining completion costs of approximately $98.7 million.

The adoption of ASC 606 requires certain costs that were previously recorded as gathering, processing and transportation expenses to be accounted for as a deduction from revenue. We elected the modified retrospective method of transition. Accordingly, comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous revenue standard.


(2) | Excludes the effects of netting gathering, transportation and processing costs under ASC 606.


(3) | General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include $0.69 per Boe and $0.06 per Boe of equity-based compensation expense, respectively.

Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018 relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells, wells capable of production and wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest, operated and non-operated, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.

 | Oil | Natural Gas | | Total
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Operated | 140 | | 110 | | 451 | | 339 | | 591 | 449
Non-operated | 318 | | 19 | | 354 | | 34 | | 672 | 53 
Total | 458 | | 129 | | 805 | | 373 | | 1,263 | 502

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018, relating to our leasehold acreage. Developed acreage consists of acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease. Undeveloped acreage is defined as acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.

Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage | Total Acreage
Gross(1) | Net(2) | Gross(1) | Net(2) | Gross(1) | Net(2) 
298,019 | 144,932 | 85,411 | 27,038 | 383,430 | 171,970


(1) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which a working interest is owned.


(2) | A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.


Many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 84% of our total net acreage was held by production. 
The following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage, as of December 31, 2018, that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates.


2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 and Thereafter
Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net
19,563 | 6,675 | 42,712 | 10,766 | 10,944 | 4,056 | — | — | — | — 

11

We intend to extend substantially all of the net acreage associated with our inventory of drilling locations through a combination of development drilling and leasehold extension and renewal payments. Of the 6,675 net acres expiring in 2019 and the 10,766 net acres expiring in 2020, we have the right to extend on 1,017 and 1,750 net acres, respectively.

Drilling Results
The following table sets forth the results of our drilling activity, as defined by wells having been placed on production, for the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce, or are capable of producing, commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. Dry wells are those that prove to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.

(1) | Although a well may be classified as productive upon completion, future changes in oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and production may result in the well becoming uneconomical, particularly exploratory wells where there is no production history.

As of December 31, 2018, we had 33 gross (24 net) wells waiting on completion with associated remaining net completion costs of approximately $98.7 million. 
Operations
General
As of December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 71% of our net acreage position. As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day‑to‑day basis. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve 
12

production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of our production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our oil, natural gas and NGL production to purchasers at market prices, adjusted for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials, and in the case of natural gas, energy content. While a majority of our natural gas and NGLs is sold under long‑term contracts with terms of greater than twelve months, a portion is sold under six‑month and month‑to‑month contracts. We sell all of our oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less.
We normally sell our production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in our business. The following table identifies customers from whom we derived 10% or more of receipts from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing LLC | 31 | % | | * | | * | 
Sunoco Inc. | 18 | % | | 40 | % | 55 | %
Blue Mountain Midstream LLC | 15 | % | | * | | * | 
EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP | 13 | % | | 39 | % | 31 | %

* Revenue from customer was less than 10% in this period.
Blue Mountain Midstream LLC (“Blue Mountain”) is deemed a related party as it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Riviera.
If a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us, our revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Transportation
During the initial development of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure options in the areas of our production which does not have an existing dedication. Our oil is transported from the wellsite tank batteries by truck to terminal pipeline sites or direct to a refinery. Our natural gas is generally transported by third-party gathering lines from the wellhead to a gas processing facility.
Natural Gas Dedication Agreements
We have dedicated our natural gas production from the oil and natural gas properties contributed by Citizen under an agreement with a third party. Under this dedication agreement, we are required to deliver our natural gas production from the contract area, as defined in the agreement, through November 2030. There is no specified volume or volume penalty in the agreement.
13

For the oil and natural gas properties contributed by Linn, we assumed Linn’s dedication agreement with Blue Mountain, a subsidiary of Riviera. The agreement with Blue Mountain requires us to deliver our natural gas production from the contract area, as defined in the agreement, through November 2030. There is no specified volume or volume penalty in the agreement.
Volume Commitment
The substantial majority of our midstream agreements are structured as acreage dedications with no specified volume commitments. However, we do have one agreement with a third party that requires us to deliver a minimum volume of natural gas from a specified dedication area. In the event that we are unable to meet this natural gas volume delivery commitment, we would incur deficiency fees on any undelivered volumes as of November 2021. If we are unable to deliver any natural gas volumes subsequent to December 31, 2018 through November 2021, we will owe deficiency fees of $8.1 million at the end of the commitment period. 
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of complying with existing, and subsequently amended, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of complying with existing, and subsequently amended, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
14

Operating Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating hazards and risks that could result in substantial losses from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. We may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate funds otherwise available, or result in the loss of properties. In addition, we participate in wells on a non-operated basis and therefore may be limited in our ability to control the risks associated with the operation of such wells.
In accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential losses. We cannot provide assurance that any insurance we obtain will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We have elected to self-insure for certain items for which we have determined that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For more information about potential risks that could affect us, please see “Risk Factors.”
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties in connection with acquisition of leasehold acreage. At such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have in our possession or have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry.
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion, obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this report.
15

Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25.0%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 74% to 81% of our working interest, with an average net revenue interest of 78.9%.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
Regulation Affecting Production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, and orders of regulatory bodies under those laws and regulations, governing a wide variety of matters. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill.
The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of oil and natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation Affecting Sales and Transportation of Commodities
Sales prices of oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, the U.S. Congress historically has been active in their regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas, or 
16

the prices charged for these commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the U.S. Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil and natural gas may be subject to certain state and federal reporting requirements.
The price and terms of service of transportation of the commodities, including access to pipeline transportation capacity, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Such regulation may affect the marketing of natural gas produced by us, as well as the revenues received for sales of such production. Gathering systems may be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase, or accept for gathering, without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes may affect whether and to what extent gathering capacity is available for natural gas production, if any, of the drilling program and the cost of such capacity. Further state laws and regulations govern rates and terms of access to intrastate pipeline systems, which may similarly affect market access and cost.
The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to ensure terms and conditions of interstate transportation service are not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential, to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to promote market transparency. We do not believe that our drilling program will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner materially differently than other similarly situated natural gas producers.
In addition to the regulation of natural gas pipeline transportation, FERC has jurisdiction over the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Under the EPAct 2005, it is unlawful for “any entity,” including producers such as us, that are otherwise not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 up to $1.0 million per day, per violation. The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under FERC Order No. 704 (defined below).
In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order No. 704”). Under Order No. 704, any market participant, including a producer that engages in certain wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, must annually report such sales and purchases to FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such 
17

transactions utilize, contribute to the formation of price indices. Not all types of natural gas sales are required to be reported on Form No. 552. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.
The FERC also regulates rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate transportation of liquids, including NGLs, under the Interstate Commerce Act, as it existed on October 1, 1977 (“ICA”). Prices received from the sale of liquids may be affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. The ICA requires that certain interstate liquids pipelines maintain a tariff on file with FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before FERC.
The rates charged by many interstate liquids pipelines are currently adjusted pursuant to an annual indexing methodology established and regulated by FERC, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under FERC’s regulations, a liquids pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by obtaining market based rate authority (demonstrating the pipeline lacks market power), establishing rates by settlement with all existing shippers, or through a cost of service approach (if the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology). Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows for us.
In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity or for new shippers. Therefore, new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, we believe that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
Rates for intrastate pipeline transportation of liquids are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. We believe that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on our similarly situated competitors.
In addition to FERC’s regulations, we are required to observe anti market manipulation laws with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities. In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to approximately $1.2 million per violation per day. In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to prohibit market 
18

manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement their new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of approximately $1.1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge and disposal of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment and natural resources (including threatened and endangered species and their habitat). Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling, water withdrawal, wastewater disposal and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be disposed or released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities, and the manner of any such disposal, release, or injection; (iii) limit or prohibit our operations on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, or require formal mitigation measures in such sensitive areas; (iv) require investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and on-going operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (v) impose specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, corrective or remedial obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Continued compliance with existing requirements is not expected to materially affect us. However, there is no assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are or may be subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.

Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. The agency missed the deadline, though review may still be ongoing. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking, the consent decree requires that EPA take final action by no later than July 15, 2021. Any such change could result in an increase in our as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry’s costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off site locations, where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed 
20

substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States (“WOTUS”). Several legal challenges to the rule followed, along with attempts to stay implementation of the WOTUS rule following the change in U.S. presidential administrations. Currently, the WOTUS rule is active in 22 states and enjoined in 28 states. However, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed changes to regulations under the CWA that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intent to challenge the proposed WOTUS replacement rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time. To the extent either rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain responsible parties related to the prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example,
operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees, use secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby water bodies and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. The OPA subjects owners and operators of vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities to strict, joint and several liability for oil removal costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Subsurface Injections and Induced Seismicity
In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil, natural gas and NGLs. Water that is not recycled may be disposed of in disposal wells, which inject the produced water into non-producing subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control 
21

(“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resources and imposition of liability by third parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property and personal injuries. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations.
Furthermore, in response to seismic events near belowground disposal wells used for the injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such disposal wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, additional requirements related to produced water disposal wells to improve seismic safety. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures including the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC, from time to time, has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within areas of interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. For example, in February 2018 the OCC revised well completion seismicity guidelines to reduce the threshold of seismic readings required to suspend hydraulic fracturing operations in some circumstances. In addition, these seismic events have also led to an increase in tort lawsuits filed against exploration and production companies as well as the owners of underground injection wells.
Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of produced water into disposal wells continues as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where produced water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of water generated by production and development activities, whether by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to third-party lawsuits alleging damages resulting from seismic events that occur in our areas of operation.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, 
22

construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance standards. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of oil and natural gas projects. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground level ozone from the current standard of 75 ppb for the current 8 hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards, and completed attainment/non-attainment designations in July 2018. States are expected to implement more stringent permitting and pollution control requirements as a result of this final rule, which could apply to our operations. While the EPA has determined that all counties in which we operate are in attainment with the new ozone standards, these determinations may be revised in the future. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in these newly designated non-attainment areas. In another example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Climate Change
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically will be established by state agencies. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States.
There has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional cap and trade programs have emerged that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The EPA has also developed strategies for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa requirements to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is pending. In addition, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized a similar rule regarding the control of methane emissions in November 2016 that applies to oil and natural gas exploration and development activities on public and tribal lands. In September 2018, the BLM issued a final rule rescinding the agency’s 2016 methane rule, and litigation challenging the rescission is pending. As a result of the developments described above, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPA and BLM methane rules. However, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and natural gas 
23

industry remain a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and natural gas production activities.
On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force on November 4, 2016; however, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.

Although it is not possible at this time to predict how new laws or regulations in the United States or any legal requirements imposed by the Paris Agreement on the United States, should it not withdraw from the agreement, that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations as well as result in delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades.  However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice in the oil and natural gas industry that is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, leak detection, and permitting and separately published an effluent limitation guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015, establishing 
24

stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM issued a final rule repealing the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. Litigation regarding this rescission is pending.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, but, at this time, federal legislation related to hydraulic fracturing appears unlikely. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, operational or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, or that prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the local, state or federal level, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
In addition to asserting regulatory authority, certain government agencies have conducted reviews focusing on environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under certain limited circumstances.” Because the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
Endangered Species and Migratory Birds Considerations
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitat. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”). We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. For example, in November 2016, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (“FWS”) completed initial reviews of a petition filed by environmental groups to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as endangered and found substantial information that the petitioned action may be warranted. An assessment of the biological status of the Lesser Prairie Chicken began in 2015, and further action remains pending. Moreover, as a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to make a determination on listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline and continues to review species for listing under the ESA. In addition, the federal government in the past has issued indictments under the MBTA to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities.
However, in December 2017, the Department of Interior issued a new opinion revoking its prior enforcement policy and concluded that an incidental take is not a violation of the MBTA. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If 
25

we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. There can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 179 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as-needed basis to perform various field and other services. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory.
