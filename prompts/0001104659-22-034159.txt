Item 1. Business
Company Overview
BRCC is a veteran-controlled company serving premium coffee, content and merchandise to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. Our mission-driven brand is devoted to cause-related content that informs, inspires, entertains, and builds our community. We are committed to producing great coffee that consumers love, and high-quality merchandise that enables our community to showcase our brand. By consistently delivering exceptional products and content, we have built and retained a strong following of loyal customers throughout the United States. We are committed to supporting those who serve and producing quality products and content for our customers.
We utilize a three-pronged approach to craft a unique brand that resonates with our customer base and enhances brand loyalty: Inform, Inspire, and Entertain. We want our audience to love coffee as much as we do, so we strive to inform them on all the awesome facets to coffee. Every day we work to inspire our customers; we take pride in the coffee we roast, the veterans we employ and the causes we support. We give back to the community and are committed to support those who serve. Our “Entertain” marketing strategy drives brand excitement, along with valuable customer insights and data.
We own two roasting facilities, one focused on large batch roasting and the other on small batch roasting. The coffee beans are primarily roasted in-house in the United States to ensure consistency and quality of product. Our coffee beans have an 83-point grade or higher and are sourced only from high quality suppliers. Our owned roasting facilities offer significant capacity for expansion and allow us to provide our customers with a fresh product.
We have experienced strong revenue growth since inception. Revenue increased to $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and from $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing growth of 42% and 100% respectively. Growth in 2021 was primarily driven by expansion of our customer base, increasing Wholesale doors, and new Outpost openings.
We are a digitally native brand. Our omnichannel distribution strategy has three key components: Direct to Consumer (“DTC”), Wholesale, and Outposts. Our DTC channel includes our e-commerce business, through which consumers order our products online and products are shipped to them. Our Wholesale channel includes products sold to an intermediary such as convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandise stores, as well as outdoor, Do it yourself (“DIY”), and lifestyle retailers, who in turn sell those products to consumers. Our Outpost channel includes revenue from our company-operated and franchised Black Rifle Coffee retail coffee shop locations. Revenue is driven primarily by our DTC channel which contributed to approximately 71%, 84% and 90% of our total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Mission
Our mission at Black Rifle Coffee Company is to serve premium coffee and content to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. Our company began with a simple premise — to provide a quality product while giving back to the veteran, active military, and first responder communities through direct hiring, inspiring stories told through our media channels and charitable donations. As a business founded and owned by combat veterans of the Global War on Terror, we are mission-driven: everything we do, every decision we make, is in service of our mission.
It begins with our people. At Black Rifle Coffee, our goal is to hire 10,000 veterans and be the employer of choice for individuals seeking a post-military career. We aim to not just hire veterans, but also inspire veterans to become entrepreneurs and highlight for other businesses the benefits of hiring veterans. Today, veterans and veteran spouses comprise approximately 50% of our total employee base of over 800 people, including part-time and seasonal workers. According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), there are 18.5 million U.S. military veterans, comprising approximately 7% of the U.S. adult population. While BLS data suggest veteran unemployment rates track the overall market in general, a recent study by ZipRecruiter indicates that underemployment among veterans is approximately 15.6% higher than the general population. More significant, veterans suffer from mental health issues at a much greater rate than their civilian counterparts.
We donated over $3 million of coffee to military and first responder units and over $1 million in other donations to charitable organizations in 2021. Certain legacy holders of SilverBox and Authentic Brands donated over 530,000 shares of Class A Common

Stock to the BRCC Fund. The BRCC Fund focuses on veteran-related causes important to the Company, including education and job training for veterans and scholarships for family members of veterans killed or wounded in action.
Who We Are
Black Rifle Coffee Company is a rapidly growing, veteran-controlled and led coffee and media company with an incredibly loyal and quickly expanding community of more than 2 million lifetime consumers, more than 287,000 active coffee club subscribers, and 11.7 million social media followers across Black Rifle Coffee’s, co-founders’, and key media personalities’ accounts as of December 31, 2021. Evan Hafer, Mat Best, and Jarred Taylor founded the Company in 2014 with a one-pound roaster in Evan’s garage, roasting, packaging, and shipping bagged coffee direct to consumers.
Today, Black Rifle Coffee operates out of facilities and offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Manchester, Tennessee; and San Antonio, Texas, and offers over 20 varieties of roasted whole bean and ground coffee, plus Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”), single-serve, and instant coffee. Our historical performance reflects the scale and growth of our company.
At Black Rifle Coffee, we develop our roast profiles with the same mission focus we learned as military members serving our country. We produce creative and engaging, cause-related media content, self-produced podcasts, and digital and print journalism in-house to inform, inspire, entertain, and build our community. We also sell Black Rifle Coffee-brand apparel, coffee brewing equipment, and outdoor and lifestyle gear that our consumers proudly wear and use to showcase our brand. Merchandise and equipment sales accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 9% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our DTC platform has been the core of our business from day one starting with www.blackriflecoffee.com. It has enabled us to quickly become a large, recognizable, and fast-growing beverage brand in the United States, while also allowing us to better understand our consumers and their consumption preferences.
We offer a subscription service, our Coffee Club, through which DTC consumers can receive ground, whole bean, single serve, instant, or RTD coffee shipped to their home or office as frequently as every fourteen days. We believe the Coffee Club offers unparalleled value and convenience for consumers. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 287,000 Coffee Club subscribers, a number that has grown by more than 20 times since March 31, 2017. We also sell coffee, apparel, and gear online for individual purchase on a non-subscription basis. Our DTC channel generated $165.3 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $137.7 million over the corresponding period in 2020, representing an increase of 20%. More than 40% of our 2021 revenue came from recurring subscriptions.
Our Wholesale channel complements our DTC sales. In our Wholesale channel, we sell coffee, apparel, and gear through leading outdoor, DIY, and lifestyle retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s, and 5.11 Tactical, as well as specialty retailers. We also sell RTD coffee in leading convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandise retailers, including Casey’s General Store, Circle K, Kum & Go, Speedway, 7-Eleven, Publix, HEB, Walmart, CVS, and Sam’s Club. Our Wholesale channel generated $55.8 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $23.4 million over the corresponding period in 2020, representing an increase of 139%.
We also operate and franchise Black Rifle Coffee shops, which we call “Outposts.” We believe our Outposts redefine the typical coffee shop experience, offering consumers an immersive environment in which to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of high-quality coffee, stock up on Black Rifle Coffee merchandise and bagged coffee, and connect with members of the local community. We opened our first company-operated Outpost in 2020 in San Antonio, Texas, and we are in the early stages of our nationwide growth, with sixteen Outposts open across six states as of December 31, 2021. Our Outpost channel generated $12.0 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.8 million over the corresponding period in 2020 representing an increase of 329%.
Segment Information
We operate as one reportable segment.

Competition
We are uniquely positioned to compete in the $45 billion coffee market across at-home, RTD, and out-of-home coffee segments and against other high-growth consumer businesses. Competition in our markets is based on factors such as product quality, roasting methods, brand recognition, and technology. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of our superior product, powerful media platform, mission-led lifestyle brand with a loyal customer base, and scalable omnichannel strategy with a strong subscriber base. We roast the majority of our coffee beans in-house, and we consider our roasting methods essential to the quality of our products. We believe that we serve a more attractive customer base than the broader coffee market, as our customers are more engaged with our brand. Our customers consistently buy our branded merchandise in addition to coffee; our consumers proudly wear Black Rifle Coffee apparel, display Black Rifle Coffee banners and decals, buy multiple Black Rifle Coffee products, and proactively recommend us to their friends, family, and others through social media and by word-of-mouth. We believe the emotional connection and brand advocacy of our consumers helps fuel our growth and grants us the opportunity to expand our product offering.
In the RTD category we compete against established, well-known brands like Monster, private-label brands like Orinoco, and high-growth food and beverage companies such as Celsius. The RTD and retort dairy businesses are highly competitive, with high barriers to entry including production and distribution.
In the out-of-home coffee category we compete against both well-known brands and also small local coffee shops. Longer-established out-of-home coffee competitors may have greater brand recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technological, roasting, sale, distribution, and other resources. Our customers spend more than the typical coffee buyer on a per-purchase basis due to merchandise and bagged coffee sales. This drives an attractive average order value of approximately $12 to $13 and high cash-on-cash returns at our Outposts.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations. The first quarter typically will experience lower revenues. In our DTC and Outpost revenue channels, we tend to have higher revenues and cash flow during the holiday season in the fourth quarter. Results for any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results for a full fiscal year.
Our Community
Black Rifle Coffee Company was founded with a commitment to giving back to and supporting active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. As a veteran-founded and veteran-controlled company, we are committed to hiring veterans and veteran spouses, which currently represent approximately 50% of our workforce. Our media campaigns celebrate the active military, veterans, and first responders and showcase their unique stories and experiences. In 2021, we donated coffee valued at over $3 million to military and first responder units, and over $1 million in other donations to charitable organizations.
Our mission-driven approach and brand values resonate with our consumers and allowed us to build a strong Black Rifle Coffee community. According to a company survey, the top three reasons that customers purchase from Black Rifle Coffee are due to our support for the military and veterans, our great tasting coffee, and our brand’s alignment with their values. Our community is broad and reaches a diverse audience across geographies and demographics.
Human Capital
We have built a strong and cohesive culture centered around our mission of serving coffee and content to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. We are veteran-controlled, and approximately 50% of our employees are veterans or veteran spouses. We have set a goal to hire 10,000 veterans and will continue to work towards this goal as we expand our operations and further develop our Outpost model.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 836 employees across locations in the United States. Of the 836 employees, 68 are focused on production, 447 are in marketing, operations or other administrative roles, and 321 are in roles at Outposts. In addition, we employ part-time and seasonal workers. We will increase in headcount across the business but expect most of our employment growth to be driven by our new Outpost openings. We will continue to focus on hiring veterans and training our employees to provide the authentic Black Rifle Coffee Company experience in our Outpost locations.

Intellectual Property
We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the United States, including the trademark for “Black Rifle Coffee Company,” and our word marks have been registered in multiple classes of goods and services. We own a more limited subset of registered trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. Our most important trademark might be our “BRCC” logo, which immediately identifies the brand. We believe that the Black Rifle Coffee Company name and all of its associated marks are of significant value and importance to our business. As a general policy, we pursue registration and monitor the use of our marks in the United States and challenge any unauthorized use.
We license the use of our marks to franchise partners, third-party vendors, and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements, and licensing agreements. These agreements typically restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
Government Regulations
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, zoning and fire codes, and franchising. Failure to obtain or retain licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operation of our shops. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate experiencing any significant problems obtaining required licenses, permits, or approvals, any difficulties, delays, or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a shop in a particular area. The development and construction of additional shops will be subject to compliance with the applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations.
Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and various state laws regulation the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rules and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain financial information to prospective franchise partners in a number of states requiring registration of the FDD with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchise or franchise relationship exist in a substantial number of states, and bill have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchise partner to designate sources of supply. We believe our FDD complies in all material aspects with both the FTC franchise rules and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have franchises.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal and state laws governing such matters such as minimum wage, overtime, employment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and other working conditions. A significant number of our personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability and public accommodations in employment, which may require us to design or modify our facilities to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.
Environmental
We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay construction and increase development costs for new facilities.
Organizational Structure
Following the completion of the Business Combination, our organizational structure is what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership C corporation (or Up-C) structure. This organizational structure allows certain owners of Authentic Brands to retain their equity ownership in Authentic Brands, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of Common Units and Restricted Common Units. Each continuing owner of Authentic Brands also holds a number of shares 

12



of Class B Common Stock in the Company equal to the number of Common Units held by such owner, which has no economic value, but which entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share at any meeting of our shareholders. Those investors who, prior to the Business Combination, held Class A ordinary shares, Class B ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares of SilverBox and certain other investors hold, by contrast their equity ownership in the Company, a Delaware public benefit corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
