Our History and Founding Principles
 
Our founders, Margaret and Philip Isely, were early proponents of the connection between health and the use of natural and organic products and dietary supplements. In the mid-1950’s, Margaret transformed her health and the health of her family by applying concepts and principles she learned from books on nutrition. This inspired the Iselys to provide the same type of nutrition education to their community. The Iselys started by lending books on nutrition and providing samples of whole grain bread door-to-door in Golden, Colorado and subsequently concluded they could develop a viable business that would also improve their customers’ wellbeing. Over time, they fostered relationships through nutrition education and began taking orders for dietary supplements, whole grain bread and unprocessed foods. As their customers gained more knowledge about nutrition, they were empowered to make changes to their diets with the objective of supporting their health. Using this model as the foundation for their business, the Iselys opened their first store in 1958.
 
We are committed to maintaining the following founding principles, which have helped foster our growth:
 

● | Nutrition Education. We provide free nutrition education in the communities we serve. Empowering our customers and our employees (or our Crew members) to take charge of their lives and their health is the foundation upon which our business is built.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality. Every product on our shelves must go through a rigorous screening and approval process. Our mission includes providing the highest quality groceries and supplements, Natural Grocers branded products and only United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic, fresh produce.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Always Affordable PriceSM. We work hard to secure the best possible prices on all of our customers’ favorite natural and organic foods and supplements. We believe everyone should be able to afford to help take care of their health by buying high-quality competitively priced natural and organic products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Community. From free nutrition education, to bag-free checkouts, to sourcing local products, to our fundraising and donation programs, we strive to serve the communities that help shape our world.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Crew members. Our Crew members make our Company great. We work hard to ensure that our Crew members are able to live healthy, balanced lifestyles. We support them with free nutrition education programs, good pay and excellent benefits.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 1998, the second generation of the Isely family, including Kemper Isely, Zephyr Isely, Heather Isely and Elizabeth Isely, purchased our predecessor and the Vitamin Cottage® trademark and assumed control of the business. Since then, we have grown our store count from 11 stores in Colorado to 164 stores in 21 states as of September 30, 2022. We have also implemented numerous organizational and operational improvements that have enhanced our ability to scale our operations. We believe that by staying true to our founding principles, we have been able to continue to attract new customers, extend our geographic reach and further solidify our competitive position.
 
Our Markets
 
We operate within the natural products retail industry, which is a subset of the United States grocery industry and the dietary supplement business. This industry includes conventional supermarkets, natural, gourmet and specialty food markets, domestic and foreign-based mass and discount retailers, warehouse clubs, independent health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers’ markets, food co-ops, online retailers, meal delivery services and multi-level marketers. Industry-wide sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements have grown over the past several years, and we believe that growth will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements continues to be driven by numerous factors, including:
 

● | greater consumer focus on high-quality nutritional products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increased awareness of the importance of good nutrition to long-term wellness;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased awareness by consumers of the importance of building and maintaining a strong immune system to mitigate health risks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an aging United States population seeking to support healthy aging;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   2

 


● | heightened consumer awareness about the importance of food quality and a desire to avoid toxic residues, hormones, growth promoters, artificial ingredients, and genetically engineered ingredients in foods;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | concerns regarding antibiotic resistance caused by industrial livestock production practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing consumer concerns over the use of harmful chemical additives in body care and household cleaning supplies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | well-established natural and organic brands, which generate additional industry awareness and credibility with consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the growth in the number of consumers with unique dietary requirements as a result of allergies, chemical sensitivities, auto-immune disorders and other conditions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | concerns about the cumulative environmental impact of relying on non-renewable resources and the effects on the global climate of carbon release from conventional agriculture.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on favorable natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industry dynamics as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 
Strict focus on high-quality natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. We offer high-quality products and brands, including an extensive selection of widely recognized natural and organic food, dietary supplements, body care products, pet care products and books. We offer our customers an average of approximately 21,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) of natural and organic products per comparable store (stores open for 13 months or longer), including an average of approximately 6,900 SKUs of dietary supplements. We believe our broad product offering enables our customers to shop our stores for substantially all of their grocery and dietary supplement purchases. In our grocery departments, we only sell USDA certified organic produce and do not approve for sale grocery products that are known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. In addition, we only sell pasture-raised, non-confinement dairy products, free-range eggs (i.e., from chickens that are not only cage-free but also provided with sufficient space to move) and naturally raised meats (i.e., from animals that are not known to have been treated with antibiotics, hormones or growth promoters, or fed animal by-products). Consistent with this strategy, our product selection does not include items that do not meet our strict quality guidelines. Our store managers enhance our robust product offering by customizing their stores’ selections to address the preferences of local customers. All products undergo a stringent review process to ensure the products we sell meet our strict quality guidelines, which we believe helps us generate long-term relationships with our customers based on transparency and trust.
 
Engaging customer service experience based on education and empowerment. We strive to offer consistently exceptional customer service in a convenient, clean and shopper-friendly environment, which we believe creates a differentiated shopping experience, enhances customer loyalty and generates repeat visits from our clientele. A key aspect of our customer service model is to provide free nutrition education to our customers. We believe this focus provides an engaging retail experience while also empowering our customers to make informed decisions about their health. We offer our science-based nutrition education through our trained Crew members, our Health Hotline® magazine, community outreach programs, one-on-one nutrition health coaching, nutrition classes, cooking demonstrations and our website. Our commitment to nutrition education and customer empowerment is emphasized throughout our entire organization, from executive management to store Crew members. Every store also maintains a Nutritional Health Coach (NHC) position. The NHC is responsible for educating our customers about good nutrition and for training our store employees on how to assist customers in compliance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Each NHC must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition, and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. Substantially all of our NHCs are full-time Crew members. We believe our NHC position represents a key element of our customer service model.

Scalable operations and replicable, cost-effective store model. We believe our scalable operating structure, attractive new store model, flexible real estate strategy and disciplined approach to new store development allow us to maximize store performance and continue to grow our store base. Our store model has been successful in highly competitive markets and has supported significant growth outside of our original Colorado geography. We believe our supply chain and infrastructure are scalable and will accommodate growth based on the ability of our primary distribution relationships to effectively service our planned store locations. Our investments in overhead and information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems, support this growth. We also have a comprehensive human resources information and learning management system (HRIS) to further support the scalability of our operations. In addition, we have established effective site selection guidelines, as well as scalable procedures to enable us to efficiently open new stores after lease execution. The smaller-store footprint made possible by our limited offering of prepared foods reduces real estate costs, labor costs and perishable inventory shrink and enables us to leverage our new store opening costs.
 
Commitment to sustainable products and practices. We have put in place product standards for dairy, eggs, meat, seafood and produce that support sustainable and ecologically responsible production methods. We believe our standards help to enhance the health of our customers, promote animal welfare, reduce antibiotic resistance and protect the environment. We have also instituted measures to eliminate food waste, divert usable products to food banks, reduce single use plastic bags and reduce the use of toxic pesticides and antimicrobial products. We believe these efforts reflect our commitment to corporate social responsibility and demonstrate our support for sustainable regenerative agricultural practices.
 
Experienced and committed management team with proven track record. Our executive management team has an average of 37 years of experience in the natural grocery industry, while our entire management team has an average of 32 years of relevant experience. Since the second generation of the Isely family assumed control of the business in 1998, we have grown our store count from 11 stores to 164 stores as of September 30, 2022 by remaining dedicated to our founding principles. Over their tenure, members of our executive management team have been instrumental in establishing a successful, scalable operating model, generating consistently strong financial results, developing an effective site selection and store opening process and implementing operational efficiencies. The depth of our management experience extends beyond our home office. As of September 30, 2022, our store managers and assistant managers at comparable stores had average tenures of approximately five years with us. In addition, we have a track record of promoting store management personnel from within. We believe our management’s experience at all levels will allow us to continue to grow our store base while maintaining operational excellence by driving efficiencies in store operations, managing inventory levels and focusing on exceptional customer service.
 
Our Growth Strategies
 
We are pursuing several strategies to continue our profitable growth, including:
 
Expand our store base. We intend to continue expanding our store base through new store openings in existing markets, as well as penetrating new markets, by leveraging our core competencies of site selection and efficient store openings. In each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we opened three new stores. We plan to open four to six new stores in fiscal year 2023, none of which opened during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 prior to the filing of this Form 10-K. As of the date of this report, we have signed leases or acquired property for an additional five new stores that we plan to open in fiscal years 2023 and beyond.

Store locations as of September 30, 2022. 
 

Increase sales from existing customers. In order to increase our average ticket and the number of customer transactions, we plan to continue offering an engaging customer experience by providing science-based nutrition education and a differentiated merchandising strategy that delivers affordable, high-quality natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. We also plan to continue to utilize targeted marketing efforts to reach our existing customers, including through the {N}power® customer loyalty program ({N}power), which we anticipate will drive customer transactions, increase the average ticket and convert occasional, single-category customers into core, multi-category customers.
 
Grow our customer base. We plan to continue building our brand awareness, which we anticipate will grow our customer base. During fiscal year 2022, the measures we took that were aimed at enhancing our brand awareness included: (i) featuring {N}power promotions to highlight affordable family meals; (ii) utilizing {N}power to identify and send personalized offers to our customers, with an emphasis on dietary supplement sales; (iii) continuing to make enhancements to our monthly Health Hotline magazine; (iv) organizing month-long seasonal and topical special promotions; (v) expanding our social media reach through increased investment in paid and organic placements on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and social media influencer campaigns; (vi) conducting television, radio, newspaper, outdoor advertising and targeted direct mail campaigns in select markets; and (vii) continuation of home delivery services. We believe offering nutrition education has historically been one of our most effective marketing strategies for reaching new customers and increasing the demand for natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in our markets. To maximize their impact, we encourage our NHCs to focus on relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers, including promotions, educational cooking events, lectures and classes in our stores. Additionally, we seek to attract new customers by enhancing their nutrition knowledge through the distribution of printed and digital versions of our broad range of educational resources, including the Health Hotline magazine. In addition to offering nutrition education, our strategy is to attract new customers with our Always Affordable Price and to build community awareness through our support of local vendors and charities.
 
Improve operating margins. We expect to continue our focus on improving our operating margins as we benefit from investments we have made or are making in fixed overhead and technology. We anticipate these investments will support our long-term growth strategy. To improve operating margins, we also intend to further optimize performance, maintain appropriate store labor levels, reduce inventory shrink and effectively manage product selection and pricing. In addition, we expect to achieve greater economies of scale through sourcing and distribution as we add more stores.
 
Our Stores
 
Our stores offer a comprehensive selection of natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in a smaller-store format that aims to provide a convenient, clean and easily shopped environment for our customers. Our store design emphasizes a clutter-free, organized feel, a quiet ambience accented with warm lighting and the absence of aromas from meat and seafood counters present in many of our competitors’ stores. We believe our core customers consider us a destination stop for their nutritional education and information, natural and organic products and dietary supplements.

Our Store Format. Our stores range from approximately 7,000 to 16,000 selling square feet, and average approximately 11,000 selling square feet. In fiscal year 2022, our three new stores and two relocations/remodels averaged approximately 10,000 selling square feet. Approximately one quarter of our stores’ selling square footage is dedicated to dietary supplements. Most of our stores also include a dedicated community room available for public gatherings, a demonstration kitchen for cooking education and/or lecture space. Our comparable stores sell an average of approximately 21,000 SKUs of natural and organic products per store, including an average of approximately 6,900 SKUs of dietary supplements. Set out below is the layout for our new stores:
Site Selection. Our real estate strategy is adaptable to a variety of market conditions. When selecting locations for new stores, we use analytical models, based on research and data provided by third parties and our extensive experience, to identify promising store locations. We typically locate new stores in prime locations which offer easy customer access and high visibility. Many of our stores are near other supermarkets or gourmet food retailers, and we complement their conventional product offerings with high-quality, affordable natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in an efficient and convenient retail setting. Our model for selecting viable new store locations incorporates factors such as target demographics, community characteristics, nearby retail activity and other measures and is based on first-hand observation of the community’s characteristics surrounding each site. We have Crew members dedicated to opening new stores efficiently and quickly, typically within approximately nine months from the time of lease execution, subject to construction permitting and the availability of construction materials and equipment.
 
Store-Level Economics. Our new stores are typically leased and require an average upfront capital investment of approximately $2.4 million, consisting of capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 million, net of tenant allowances, initial inventory of approximately $0.3 million, net of payables, and pre-opening expenses of approximately $0.2 million. We target approximately five years to recoup our initial net cash investments and approximately 30% cash-on-cash returns by the end of the sixth year following the opening. Our actual payback period averages approximately six years.
 
Individual new store investment levels and the performance of new store locations may differ widely from originally targeted levels and from store-to-store due to competitive considerations and a variety of other factors, and these differences may be material. In particular, investments in individual stores, store-level sales, profit margins, payback periods and cash-on-cash return levels are impacted by a range of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including those described under the caption “Risk Factors.”
 
Our Focus on Nutrition Education
 
Nutrition education is one of our founding principles and is a primary focus for all Crew members. We believe our emphasis on science-based nutrition education differentiates us from our competitors and creates a unique shopping experience for our customers.

Our NHCs are a core element of our nutrition education program. Every store has a NHC position to educate customers and train Crew members on nutrition. NHCs must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition, and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. To educate and empower customers to make informed nutrition choices, our NHCs are available for complimentary one-on-one nutrition health coaching sessions. Each NHC is also responsible for various relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers, including educational activities such as nutrition classes, lectures, seminars, health fairs and store tours. To maximize the impact of our NHCs, we stress the importance of their focusing on in-store educational events, offering health coaching sessions and holding nutrition classes in the community by partnering with school, municipal and corporate wellness programs. During fiscal year 2022, our NHCs resumed in-person health coaching sessions, community nutrition classes and in-store education events. We believe that our NHCs’ focus on relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers helps to enhance our marketing and branding initiatives. Additionally, our NHCs are an onsite resource for nutrition training and education for our Crew members. Each NHC trains our Crew members to use a compliant educational approach to customer service without attempting to diagnose or treat specific conditions or ailments. We believe our NHC position is a competitive differentiator and represents a key element of our customer service model.
 
Our training and education programs are supplemented by outside experts, online materials and printed handouts. We also use our Health Hotline magazine to educate our customers. The Health Hotline magazine, which was published 11 times in fiscal year 2022, includes in-depth articles on health and nutrition, along with a selection of sale items. The printed version of the Health Hotline magazine is mailed to subscribers and distributed in our stores. In addition, an electronic version of the Health Hotline magazine is distributed to subscribers via the internet and posted on our website.
 
Our Products 
 
Product Selection Guidelines. We have a set of strict quality guidelines covering all products we sell. For example:
 

● | we do not approve for sale food known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils, regardless of the proportion of its natural or organic ingredients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we only sell USDA certified organic produce;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | we only sell dairy products from pasture-raised, non-confined livestock and only sell eggs from free-range or pastured hens;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we only sell seafood from sustainable fisheries or ecologically responsible farm-raised operations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we do not sell distilled spirits, tobacco products or e-cigarettes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our product review team analyzes all new products and approves them for sale based on ingredients, price and uniqueness within the current product set. We actively research new products in the marketplace through our product vendors, private label manufacturers, scientific findings, customer requests and general trends in popular media. Our stores are fully merchandised with an extensive assortment of natural and organic products. We believe we do not need to sell conventional products to fill our selection, increase our margins or attract more customers.

What We Sell. We operate both a full-service natural and organic grocery store and a dietary supplement store within a single retail location. The following is a breakdown of our sales mix for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022:
 

The products in our stores include:
 

● | Grocery. We offer a broad selection of natural and organic grocery products with an emphasis on minimally processed and single ingredient products that are not known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils.

Additionally, we only buy from companies we believe employ humane animal-raising practices. Our seafood items are generally frozen at the time of processing and sold from our freezer section, thereby ensuring freshness and reducing food spoilage and safety issues. The seafood we sell is generally sourced from sustainable fisheries or ecologically responsible farm-raised operations and excludes endangered species.

■ | Books and Handouts. We stock approximately 200 titles in each store’s book department. Titles cover various approaches to diet, lifestyle and health. Additionally, we offer hundreds of handouts on various health topics and dietary supplements to our customers free of charge.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality Assurance. We endeavor to ensure the quality of the products we sell. We work with reputable suppliers we believe are compliant with established regulatory and industry guidelines. Our purchasing department requires a complete supplier and product profile as part of the approval process. Our dietary supplement suppliers must follow Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current good manufacturing practices supported by quality assurance testing for both the base ingredients and the finished product. We expect our suppliers to comply with industry best practices for food safety.
 
Many of our suppliers are inspected and certified under the USDA National Organic Program, through voluntary industry standards and by other third-party auditing programs with regard to additional ingredients, manufacturing and handling standards. Each Natural Grocers store is certified as an organic handler and processor by an accredited USDA certifier in the calendar year after it opens, and annually thereafter. We operate all our stores in compliance with the National Organic Program standards, which restrict the use of certain substances for cleaning and pest control and require rigorous recordkeeping and methods to prevent co-mingling and contamination, among other requirements.
 
Our Pricing Strategy
 
We have an Always Affordable Price designation on many products, while also providing special sale pricing on hundreds of additional items. We believe our pricing strategy allows our customers to shop our stores on a regular basis for their groceries and dietary supplements.
 
The key elements of our pricing strategy include:
 

● | Always Affordable Price throughout our stores;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | heavily advertised Health Hotline deals supported by manufacturer participation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   9

 


● | discounts offered to {N}power members, including promotions to highlight affordable family meals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | short term price promotions related to holidays, targeted campaigns and other events;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in-store specials generally lasting for one month and not advertised outside the store;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | managers’ specials, such as clearance, overstock, short-dated or promotional incentives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | specials on seasonally harvested produce.
--+------------------------------------------

 
As we continue to expand our store base, we believe there are opportunities for increased leverage in fixed costs, such as administrative expenses, as well as increased economies of scale in sourcing products. We strive to keep our product, operating and general and administrative costs low, which allows us to continue to offer attractive pricing for our customers.
 
Our Store Operations
 
Store Hours. Our stores typically are open from 8:30 a.m. to 8:36 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and from 9:00 a.m. to 7:35 p.m. on Sunday.
 
Store Management and Staffing. Our typical store staffing includes a manager and assistant manager, with department managers in each of the dietary supplement, grocery, dairy and frozen, produce, body care and receiving departments, as well as several non-management Crew members. Each store manager is responsible for monthly store profit and loss, including labor, merchandising and inventory costs. We also employ regional managers to oversee all store operations for regions consisting of approximately 10 to 14 stores. Each regional manager reports to, and is supported by, a director of store operations and other staff.
 
To ensure a high level of service, all employees receive training and guidance on customer service skills, product attributes and nutrition education. Crew members are carefully trained and evaluated based on a requirement that they present nutrition information in an appropriate and legally compliant educational context while interacting with customers. Additionally, store Crew members are cross-trained in various functions, including cashier duties, stocking and receiving product.
 
Every store also maintains a NHC position. The NHC is responsible for training our store Crew members and educating our customers in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Each NHC must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. Substantially all of our NHCs are full-time Crew members. The NHCs are overseen by Regional Nutritional Health Coach Managers.
 
Bulk Food Repackaging Facility and Distribution Center. We lease a 150,000 square foot bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center located in Golden, Colorado. That facility also houses a training center and certain administrative support functions.
Inventory. We use a robust merchandise management and perpetual inventory system that values goods at moving average cost. We manage most shelf stock based on weeks-on-hand relative to sales, resupply time and minimum economic order quantity.
Sourcing and Vendors. We source from approximately 1,000 suppliers and offer approximately 3,100 brands. These suppliers range from small independent businesses to multi-national conglomerates. As of September 30, 2022, we purchased approximately 78% of the goods we sell from our top 20 suppliers. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 67% of our total purchases were from United Natural Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries (UNFI). In fiscal year 2016, we extended our long-term relationship with UNFI as our primary supplier of grocery products through May 31, 2021, subject to automatic renewals for successive one-year periods unless otherwise terminated by either party, and we are currently operating under the automatic renewal term. In May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with UNFI pursuant to which we appointed Albert’s Organics, a wholly owned subsidiary of UNFI, as our primary supplier of organic produce products for the majority of our stores. We maintain good relations with UNFI and while we are exploring a longer-term extension of our relationship with UNFI beyond the expiration of the current annual auto renewal term on May 31, 2023, we believe we have adequate alternative supply methods, including self-distribution. As a result of current global supply chain issues, we have on occasion experienced shortages and delays in the delivery of certain products to our stores. We have taken steps to mitigate these disruptions to our supply chain, although certain products may be in relatively short supply or are unavailable from time to time.

We have contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce groceries and dietary supplements under the Natural Grocers brand. We have longstanding relationships with our suppliers, and we require disclosure from them regarding quality, freshness, potency and safety data information. Our bulk food private label products are packaged by us in pre-packed sealed bags to help prevent contamination while in transit and in our stores. Unlike most of our competitors, most of our private label nuts, trail mix and flours are refrigerated in our warehouse and stores to maintain freshness.
 
Our Crew Members and Our Approach to Human Capital Resources
 
We believe our Crew members make our Company great. We offer benefits, resources and training to our Crew members, and support a healthy, balanced lifestyle. We support Crew members wellness through free nutrition education programs, competitive pay and benefits and a culture that offers the opportunity to improve the lives of others. As part of our commitment to our founding principles, we are focused on the engagement, development, retention, and health and wellbeing of our Crew members.
 
As of September 30, 2022, we employed 3,235 full-time and 938 part-time (less than 30 hours per week) Crew members, including a total of 360 Crew members at our home office and our bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center. None of our Crew members are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good relations with our Crew members. We have an established set of standard operating procedures to manage our human capital management function, including hiring and human resource policies, training practices and operational instruction manuals. This allows each store to operate with strict accountability and still maintain independence to respond to its unique circumstances.
 
Culture and Engagement. Our Company strives to empower healthier communities by cultivating a culture focused on our core values, including caring for our customers and Crew members, having fun at work, inclusivity, working with passion, and being authentic. Our leadership reinforces our founding principles and core values by providing significant training on these topics to new store managers. We have also undertaken a number of initiatives designed to engage our workforce, including conducting an annual employee survey to solicit feedback from our Crew members, conducting regular focus groups with our store Crew members to identify opportunities for process improvement at our stores, and conducting monthly calls with our store leadership to review priorities and celebrate accomplishments.
Crew Member Development and Promotion. Investing in the development of our Crew members is an important area of focus to ensure the sustainability of our business. We prioritize promoting leaders from within our organization and strive to support career development through regular training and leadership development opportunities. During fiscal year 2022, we promoted internal candidates to fill 100% of our vacant regional manager positions, 79% of our vacant store manager positions, 67% of our vacant assistant store manager positions, and approximately 70% of our vacant department manager positions. We are committed to inclusion and diversity in our approach to hiring and promotion, including among our store management. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 51% of our store managers and approximately 54% of our assistant store managers were women.
 
We believe that setting Crew members up for success begins with a strong foundation. Our accelerated store manager training program provides high-potential store department managers with management training, including leadership skills and financial aspects of management, equipping participants for potential management roles within the Company upon completion. We provide all new store managers and assistant store managers with four weeks of in-person operational and managerial training at our facility in Golden, Colorado. We also conduct over 20 hours of virtual and in-person training on an annual basis for our store Crew members covering a wide array of topics, including company culture and values, store operations, nutrition education, safety and compliance.
 
Wellness and Benefits. Our Crew members are eligible for health, long-term disability, vision and dental insurance coverage, as well as Company paid short-term disability and life insurance benefits, after they meet eligibility requirements. We also provide our Crew members with access to clinical counseling resources through our employee assistance program. Additionally, our Crew members are offered a 401(k) retirement savings plan with discretionary contribution matching opportunities. We believe we pay above average retail wages. In addition, all Crew members receive in store discounts and earn an additional $1.00 per hour, up to $40 per week, in “Vitamin Bucks,” which can be used to purchase products in our stores. It is important to us that our Crew members live a healthy, balanced lifestyle, and we believe that the discounts we offer our Crew members and the Vitamin Bucks benefit provide an additional resource for our Crew members to purchase natural and organic products. We provide our Crew members with monthly free nutrition education trainings and other opportunities to earn rewards by learning about nutrition. Every Crew member also receives one day of additional pay on their birthday to express the Company’s appreciation for their service. In 2021, the Company established The Natural Grocers Heroes in Aprons Fund, a non-profit organization that provides short-term financial assistance to qualifying Crew members or their immediate family members who have experienced unanticipated hardships. We believe these and other factors have a positive impact on retention rates and encourage our Crew members to appreciate our culture, which helps them better promote our brand.

Our Customers
 
The growth in the natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industries and growing consumer interest in health and nutrition have led to an increase in our core customer base. We believe the demands for affordable, nutritious food and dietary supplements are shared attributes of our core customers, regardless of their socio-economic status. Additionally, we believe our core customers prefer a retail store environment that offers carefully selected natural and organic products and dietary supplements and supports environmentally sustainable products and practices. Our customers tend to be interested in health and nutrition and expect our store Crew members to be highly knowledgeable about these topics and related products. An analysis of our Health Hotline subscriber list indicates that our customers come from broad geographic segments, including urban, suburban and rural areas, which reflects the varied characteristics and portability of our store locations.

Marketing and Advertising
 
A significant portion of our marketing efforts is focused on educating our customers on the benefits of natural and organic grocery products, dietary supplements and our quality standards. Our customer outreach programs provide practical general nutrition knowledge to a variety of groups and individuals, schools, businesses, families and seniors. These educational efforts fulfill one of our founding principles and also offer us the opportunity to build relationships with customers and community influencers.
{N}power Customer Loyalty Program. We introduced the {N}power customer loyalty program in fiscal year 2015. {N}power members receive digital coupons, discounted pricing on certain staple items (such as free-range eggs), personalized offers and other rewards, all by providing their phone number at the time of checkout. We believe the {N}power program has enhanced customer loyalty and increased customer traffic and engagement levels. In recent years, we have enhanced the {N}power program to simplify the accumulation of rewards for users and improve the customer loyalty program experience. During fiscal year 2022, we continued to enhance the personalization, frequency and range of our {N}power offerings and featured {N}power promotions highlighting affordable family meals. We implemented an email campaign to introduce {N}power members to a variety of our offerings and sponsored sweepstakes, purchase challenges and digital scavenger hunts for {N}power members to promote program membership and sales, with an emphasis on dietary supplement sales. We believe these steps helped to increase membership in the {N}power program during fiscal year 2022. We had approximately 1.8 million registered {N}power members as of September 30, 2022 compared to approximately 1.5 million {N}power members as of September 30, 2021.
 
Health Hotline. The Health Hotline is a four-color magazine that contains a mix of in-depth health and nutrition articles, along with a selection of popular sale items. The articles aim to be relevant, science-based and written to reflect the most recent research findings. During fiscal year 2022, we continued to enhance our Health Hotline magazine. The Health Hotline magazine was published 11 times during fiscal year 2022, and we expect comparable publication frequency during fiscal year 2023. The printed version of the Health Hotline magazine is mailed to subscribers and distributed in our stores. In addition, an electronic version of the Health Hotline magazine and a weekly electronic Health Hotline newsletter are distributed to subscribers via the internet. Generally, we negotiate with our suppliers for significantly lower costs on Health Hotline featured sale items, which in turn allows us to offer lower sale prices to our customers. Focused staff training at all locations occurs concurrently with the release of each Health Hotline to ensure that store staff are familiar with the content in each issue.
 
Special Promotions and Sponsorships During fiscal year 2022, we organized special promotions to coincide with certain calendar events, such as Resolution Reset Week in January, Earth Day in April, and on the 67th anniversary of the Company’s founding in August. We also organized month-long special promotions such as the “Body Care & Beauty Bonanza” in February, the “Rock the Grill” campaign during July, the “Organic Month” campaign during September, and the “Non-GMO Month” campaign in October. Our special promotions frequently include product discounts, sweepstakes, charitable fundraisers and nutrition education classes. During fiscal year 2022, we featured a number of events intended to promote sales to friends and family of our Crew members. We expect to continue offering similar special promotions and events in the future. During fiscal year 2022, we organized a number of charitable sponsorships, including collecting donations from customers on behalf of local food banks and an environmental non-profit organization. In addition, we donated 1% of all our sales on one day in February for Crew member appreciation month and one day during our 67th anniversary to our Natural Grocers Heroes in Aprons Fund.
 
Website and Social Media. We maintain www.naturalgrocers.com as our official Company website to host store information, sale and discount offers, educational materials, product and standards information, policies and contact forms, advocacy and news items and e-commerce capabilities. Our website is intended to be part of an overall enhanced branding strategy to more effectively communicate our brand’s unique and compelling attributes, including our founding principles. Our website features enhanced product and recipe search interfaces and improved functionality with mobile and tablet devices. We believe the continued growth of site visitors, page views and other metrics of our website activity indicates that our content is timely and informative to the communities we serve. Our website is interlinked with other online and social media outlets, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube. During fiscal year 2022, we continued to increase our investment in paid and organic placements on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, resulting in enhanced social media reach, and organized social media influencer campaigns in key markets. We expect to continue investing in digital engagement activities during fiscal year 2023.
 
Advertising. Our advertising activities in fiscal year 2022 included: (i) conducting television advertising campaigns; (ii) conducting radio advertising campaigns in support of new store openings and store relocations; (iii) conducting outdoor advertising campaigns; (iv) conducting targeted direct mail campaigns; (v) newspaper advertising; (vi) utilizing organic search, search engine marketing, search engine optimization and display advertisements to deliver more customer traffic to our website and stores; and (vii) investments in paid and organic placements on social media platforms.
Home Delivery Services. As of September 30, 2022, we offered online ordering and home delivery services at 161 of our stores in partnership with a third party.
 
   13

 

New Store Openings. We use various targeted marketing efforts to support the successful introduction of our new stores in their individual markets. In addition to the distribution of our Health Hotline magazine and Internet and social media efforts targeted to the region, we utilize direct mail distribution of introductory booklets and postcards promoting our brand and providing discounts and other incentives for new customers. We also focus on community relationship-building activities, including a series of lectures and cooking and other demonstrations in each new store’s community room and/or demonstration kitchen. Other new store promotional activities include gift card and prize giveaways, sweepstakes, musical performances, appearances by our sponsorship partners and participation by local community leaders and organizations.
 
Pre-Ordering of Holiday Turkeys. We offer an in-store and online process to pre-order organic and free-range turkeys for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
 
Competition
 
The grocery and dietary supplement retail business is a large, fragmented and highly competitive industry, with few barriers to entry. Our competition varies by market and includes conventional supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway; domestic mass or discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target; natural and gourmet markets such as Whole Foods and The Fresh Market; foreign-based discount retailers such as Aldi, Lidl and Ahold Delhaize; specialty food retailers such as Sprouts and Trader Joe’s; warehouse clubs such as Sam’s Club and Costco; dietary supplement retailers such as GNC and The Vitamin Shoppe; online retailers; meal delivery services; independent health food stores; drug stores; farmers’ markets; food co-ops; and multi-level marketers. Competition in the grocery industry may intensify, and shopping dynamics may shift, as a result of, among other things, industry consolidation, new technologies, expansion by existing competitors and the increasing availability of grocery ordering, pick-up and delivery options. These businesses compete with us on the basis of price, selection, quality, customer service, convenience, location, store format, shopping experience, ease of ordering and delivery or any combination of these or other factors. They may also compete with us for products and locations. In addition, some of our competitors are expanding to offer a greater range of natural and organic foods. We also face internally generated competition when we open new stores in markets we already serve. We believe our commitment to carrying only carefully vetted, affordably priced and high-quality natural and organic products and dietary supplements, as well as our focus on providing nutritional education, differentiate us in the industry and provide a competitive advantage.
Seasonality
 
Our business is active throughout the calendar year and does not experience significant fluctuation caused by seasonal changes in consumer purchasing.
 
Insurance and Risk Management 
 
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to cover workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, cyber risk, employment practices liability, employee healthcare benefits and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements and providers on an ongoing basis.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We have received the registration of trademarks not only for Natural Grocers®, Vitamin Cottage® and Health Hotline® but also for our logo, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage® and Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers® for appropriate categories of trade. In addition, we have received the registration of service marks for EDAP – Every Day Affordable Price®, {N}power®, Organic Headquarters®, Organic Month Headquarters®, Organic Produce Headquarters®, Natural Grocers Cottage Wine and Craft Beer® and Resolution Reset Day® and registrations of trademarks for These Came First® and Natural Grocers Top 10 Nutrition Trends®. We do not own or license for use any patents, franchises or concessions that are material to our business. Our trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.

Information Technology Systems
 
We have made significant investments in overhead and information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems. We use an ERP system with an integrated merchandise management, reporting and accounting system at all of our stores, as well as at our bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center and for corporate functions including accounting, reporting and purchasing. Our ERP system application support and hardware functions are outsourced, which allows us to focus on our core business. We also have an enterprise-wide HRIS, which has enabled us to more efficiently and effectively manage our human resources and payroll needs at all locations. In recent years, we have implemented a new point of sale system and a Company-wide scheduling system for our stores, deployed new handheld technology and VoIP telephony solutions at all our stores, and increasingly leveraged cloud technology in our information technology systems. We have also invested in upgrading communication circuits and refreshing network and security hardware and systems at all our stores and our corporate headquarters. We plan to continue investing in our information technology infrastructure with systems that scale with and add efficiencies to our operations as we continue to grow.
Regulatory Compliance 
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices that affect our business. The safety, formulation, manufacturing, processing, packaging, importation, labeling, promotion, advertising and distribution of products we sell in our stores, including private label products, are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), the USDA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the CPSC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), as well as by various state and local agencies.
Food Products. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (including pet food and pet food ingredients but excluding meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products, which are regulated by USDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA). The USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service regulates and regularly inspects meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products to assure that these products are safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.
 
The Food Safety Modernization Act (the FSMA), enacted in 2011, amended the FDCA and significantly expanded food safety requirements and the FDA’s regulatory authority over food safety. The FSMA requires the FDA to impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States and provides the FDA with authority to enforce mandatory recalls. In addition, the FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices and other tasks. Further, even statutes and regulations that have been enacted or promulgated, such as nutritional labeling, are periodically reviewed and updated with new requirements. As a result, final implementation of the legislation remains ongoing.
 
The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of cosmetics, food and dietary supplements. Labeling is a broad concept that, under most circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website and printed or digital media. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with specific information with respect to standards of product identity, net quantity/weight, nutrition or supplement facts labeling, ingredient statements, contact information for the manufacturer/packer/distributor, allergens, and certain other disclosures. Similarly, cosmetic products labeling must also contain certain information, including the nature and use of the product such as net quantity/weight, ingredient statements, and contact information for the manufacturer/packer/distributor. The FDA also regulates the use of claims made about these products, including structure/function claims (e.g., “calcium builds strong bones”), qualified health claims (e.g., "adequate calcium throughout life may reduce the risk of osteoporosis"), and nutrient content claims (e.g., “high in antioxidants”), and others. “Organic” claims, however, are primarily regulated by the USDA. Certain new food labeling requirements, primarily related to the Nutrition Facts Label, went into full effect on January 1, 2021.
 
 15

 

Dietary Supplements. The FDA also has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of dietary supplements, dietary ingredients, labeling and current good manufacturing practices. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), enacted in 1994, greatly expanded the FDA’s regulatory authority over dietary supplements. Through DSHEA, dietary supplements became a separately regulated subcategory of food, and the FDA was empowered to establish good manufacturing practice regulations governing key aspects of the production of dietary supplements, including quality control, record keeping, packaging and labeling. DSHEA also expressly permits dietary supplements to make label claims and promotional statements describing how a product affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body if adequate scientific evidence exists to substantiate the claim, although no statement may expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, treat or prevent a disease, which are claims reserved for drug products that are regulated separately by the FDA. Recently, pharmaceutical industry participants have engaged in advocacy to compel the FDA to ban certain dietary supplements based on the Drug Exclusion Provision contained in DSHEA. The Drug Exclusion Provision states that a dietary supplement may not be marketed if a dietary supplement ingredient was an ingredient in a drug or the subject of a clinical investigation for drug use prior to the marketing of the supplement. The FDA has taken certain steps to exclude certain dietary supplements under this provision. If the FDA increases enforcement of the Drug Exclusion Provision, certain of the dietary supplements we sell may no longer be available.
 
FDA Enforcement. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, transport and promotion of cosmetics, foods and dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, institute an administrative detention of food, request or order a recall of illegal food products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution. Pursuant to the FSMA, the FDA also has the power to deny the import of any food or dietary supplement from a foreign supplier that is not appropriately verified as being compliant with all FDA laws and regulations. Moreover, the FDA has the authority to administratively suspend the registration of any facility that produces or processes food, including supplements, that it deems to present a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences. In the past few years, the FDA has commenced enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies by issuing warning letters regarding products that make impermissible claims related to treatments and cures for various diseases.
 
Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising. In addition to the FDA’s regulatory control over product labeling, the FTC also exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements, including health benefit claims, general claims about environmental benefits, and claims about the geographic origin of products (e.g. “Made in the USA”) and claims about whether product packaging is recyclable or compostable, as well as deceptive advertising methods. The FTC has the power to levy monetary sanctions and impose “consent decrees” and penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. In addition, private parties are increasingly initiating broad consumer class actions against food and dietary supplement manufacturers for false or misleading labeling and/or advertising.
Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and statutory requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate certifications, representations and warranties, insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in the products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or withdraw such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
 
We regularly train our in-store Crew members to provide an educational customer service approach that is ethical, honest and accurate and that does not cross over into a scope of practice reserved for licensed healthcare professionals. For example, our Crew members are not allowed to discuss any “disease” or “cure.” Instead, we focus on how the structure and function of the body is affected by lifestyle choices and the different nutritional components of an individual’s diet, including those contained in dietary supplements. Our customers are encouraged to make informed decisions about their diet, lifestyle and possible need for supplementation. Our NHCs are responsible for overseeing compliance with FDA, USDA and FTC regulations in our stores. While we believe that our nutrition education practices are compliant with federal and state requirements, a finding to the contrary could pose significant issues with respect to our business and our reputation among our customers or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
 16

 

New or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry, such as those relating to industrial hemp products and genetically modified (bioengineered) foods, could result in additional compliance costs and civil remedies. In some instances, laws and regulations may be amended in the future to allow for private rights of action to enforce laws and regulations through lawsuits. The risks associated with these laws and regulations are further described under the caption “Risk Factors.”
