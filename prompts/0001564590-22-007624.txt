Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of irreversible covalent small molecule drugs to treat patients with genetically defined cancers and metabolic diseases. An irreversible covalent small molecule drug is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional reversible drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response. Leveraging our extensive expertise in irreversible covalent binding chemistry and development, we built our proprietary FUSION™ System discovery platform to advance a pipeline of novel irreversible covalent small molecule product candidates. 
 Our lead product candidate, BMF-219, is designed to be an orally bioavailable, potent and selective irreversible covalent inhibitor of menin, an important transcriptional regulator known to play a direct role in oncogenic signaling in multiple cancers. In preclinical studies, administration of BMF-219 has resulted in robust anti-tumor responses across a range of liquid and solid tumor models and has been generally well-tolerated in animal studies. Additionally, administration of BMF-219 produced a pronounced effect in preclinical models of diabetes, normalizing glucose levels during treatment and even after drug washout. We are developing BMF-219 for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors that are highly dependent on menin, including leukemias containing the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion protein. In September 2021, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cleared our investigational new drug (IND) application to begin a Phase 1 trial of BMF-219 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia including those with an MLL/KM2TA gene rearrangement or nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation. In December 2021, we amended our IND to include subsets of multiple myeloma (MM) and diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. It has been shown that menin is a key node in regulating the activity of MYC, a key oncogenic driver in many MM and DLBCL patients. Our preclinical data shows that BMF-219 can strongly down-regulate MYC gene activity and/or cell growth/viability in these tumor types. In January 2022, we announced that, subject to the submission and clearance of additional INDs, we plan to initiate clinical trials that further the development of BMF-219 in up to seven distinct cancer indications as well as in diabetes. 
 Beyond BMF-219, we are utilizing our novel platform to develop irreversible covalent treatments against other high-value oncogenic drivers of cancer and expect to nominate our second development candidate in the first half of 2022. Additionally, we expect to provide an update on progress for our third development candidate in 2022. Our goal is to utilize our capabilities and platform to become a leader in developing irreversible covalent small molecules in order to maximize the depth and durability of clinical benefit when treating various cancers. 
 After working closely together at Pharmacyclics, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Thomas Butler, and Chief Operating Officer and President, Ramses Erdtmann, founded Biomea Fusion in 2017 with the goal of developing targeted therapies for patients suffering from genetically defined cancers. Our management team has significant experience in precision oncology and in progressing products from early-stage research to clinical trials and ultimately to regulatory approval and commercialization. Together, they bring in-house expertise in medicinal chemistry, biology, translational medicine, computational biology and chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, biomarker development, and manufacturing. We have also established internal expertise in clinical development, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, clinical pharmacology, regulatory, and quality. Other members of the management team have held various positions at Genentech, Gilead Sciences, Pharmacyclics and Celera. We are supported by our board of directors, scientific advisory board, and a leading syndicate of investors.

Key Advantages of Irreversible Covalent Inhibition
 Since the discovery of aspirin in 1899, drugs that form permanent bonds with their target (irreversible drugs) have been known to offer a number of potential safety, tolerability, and efficacy advantages over conventional reversible drugs through multiple mechanisms, including: 

• | High Selectivity: Irreversible covalent drugs engage their target via a two-step inhibition approach with an initial reversible binding followed by covalent interaction to a key residue in the target, increasing target selectivity compared to reversible approaches. Leveraging both non-covalent and covalent interactions in a two-step kinetic process can lead to greater selectivity versus reversible compounds, which rely solely on non-covalent binding. This has the potential to reduce the likelihood of non-specific, off-target interactions that often lead to safety and tolerability concerns. Additionally, irreversible covalent drugs can be designed to have greater ligand efficiency, which has the potential to provide high selectivity and potency without jeopardizing drug-like properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep Inactivation of Target: Upon binding, an irreversible covalent inhibitor may not only cause inactivation of the target but may also result in the elimination of the target through normal cellular degradation processes. The diseased cell then either undergoes rapid apoptosis or differentiation into a normal, mature cell. Such transformation has the potential to provide the patient with a durable, lasting benefit.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Greater Therapeutic Window: Irreversible covalent inhibitors are designed to create a permanent bond with high affinity and long residence time. Unlike conventional reversible drugs, which typically need to be present to provide benefit, irreversible covalent drugs have the potential to maintain their effect in the absence of sustained drug exposure. The permanent inhibition of target function upon irreversible covalent binding essentially uncouples pharmacodynamics (drug effects) (PD) from pharmacokinetics (drug exposure) (PK) as target inhibition persists after the drug has been cleared from the system. This property of irreversible covalent drugs can potentially lead to lower drug doses and less frequent dosing regimens versus reversible approaches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite the potential advantages of irreversible covalent small molecules, the majority of approved drugs are reversible binders due to the target protein structural requirements and chemistry expertise necessary to develop safe and effective targeted irreversible covalent therapies. Leveraging our management team’s experience at Pharmacyclics (acquired by AbbVie in 2015) developing ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), and Gilead Sciences, we built a proprietary platform to enable the design and development of novel irreversible, small molecule product candidates against high-value oncogenic drivers of cancer. Our FUSION™ System discovery platform encompasses the following: 
  
• | Target Selection Validation and AI/VR Matching: We use our expertise in structural biology and irreversible covalent binding chemistry to identify both validated and novel targets that we believe may have a demonstrable and specific impact on disease and have particular structural characteristics that would be amenable to direct intervention with an irreversible covalent binder.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Scaffold Creation: We create novel chemical scaffolds using a computational platform to exploit the unique structural elements of a specific target protein. We then screen these scaffolds with in-house technologies to select the optimal candidates for further construction and design. This evaluation process is intended to increase the probability of having multiple targeted compounds that can advance through the discovery process and into the clinic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecule Optimization/Refinement: Using our proprietary suite of computational technologies, assays, analytical approaches, chemistry, and know-how we strive to maximize the potential selectivity, potency, safety, and convenience of our oral irreversible covalent small molecule product candidates. We avoid compound library screening, which results in highly selective/specified scaffolds. This saves considerable time during the lead optimization step.

Our Programs
 We believe that irreversible covalent small molecules have the potential to address the key limitations of existing reversible therapeutics and treat diseases where targeted therapies are not yet approved. While as an organization we have not yet obtained approval to commercialize any of our product candidates and our management’s past experience, including developing ibrutinib, does not guarantee similar results or success for our company, we believe such experience of our management team makes us well-positioned to address this opportunity and is a key competitive advantage. The following table summarizes our wholly owned research and development pipeline: 
 


Our lead product candidate, BMF-219, is designed to be an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective irreversible covalent inhibitor of menin, a ubiquitously expressed scaffold protein that functions in histone modification and epigenetic gene regulation to impact multiple cellular processes including cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Interaction between menin and MLL proteins results in deregulated expression of downstream genes, which subsequently triggers uncontrolled cell proliferation. Internal and external preclinical studies have shown that disrupting the protein-protein interaction between menin and MLL can inhibit oncogenic signaling and potentially lead to cell death. In acute leukemias, MLL rearrangements (MLL-r) are caused by translocations of KMT2A (the gene that encodes the MLL protein), which leads to a modified MLL protein with enhanced affinity towards menin. This strengthened menin-MLL-r interaction drives the oncogenic state of these cells. MLL rearrangements account for approximately 5% to 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States. NPM1 mutant AML has also shown a strong dependence on the interaction of menin and MLL, representing over 30% of AML patients in the United States. While the role of menin-MLL interactions in oncogenic signaling has been extensively studied in AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), many liquid tumors (including DLBCL and MM) and multiple solid tumors (including breast, lung, pancreatic, and colon) have been shown to be dependent on menin for survival and propagation. We published data on BMF-219’s ability to alter MYC gene expression and genomic function in acute leukemia cells and the pronounced cell lethality observed with BMF-219 in two MYC-dependent Double Hit Lymphoma DLBCL cell lines at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in 2021 and plan to release additional preclinical data on the effect of BMF-219 in these liquid and solid tumors in 2022. Additionally, in January 2022 we released topline data on the observed effect of administration of BMF-219 in multiple preclinical diabetes models. Despite the high unmet need, there are currently no approved therapies directly targeting menin, and the only active clinical programs of which we are aware are studying reversible inhibitors of menin. 
 BMF-219 is an irreversible covalent menin inhibitor being developed for the treatment of cancers that are highly dependent on menin, including leukemias containing the MLL fusion protein. Preclinical studies of BMF-219 have shown sustained potent abrogation of menin-dependent oncogenic signaling and pathway control in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. BMF-219 demonstrated consistent on-target inhibition with a strong anti-proliferative effect on various menin-dependent AML cell lines; DLBCL cell lines representing categories of Double/Triple Hit Lymphoma (DHL/THL) and Double Expressor Lymphoma (DEL); and MM cell lines harboring diverse mutational backgrounds, including MYC dysregulation. BMF-219 also exhibited high potency in in vitro and ex vivo KRAS-driven cancer cell models. MYC, which exerts much of its oncogenic activity through interaction with menin, is a major downstream effector of the KRAS pathway. We filed an IND for BMF-219 with the FDA and received 
 7


clearance in the third quarter of 2021. In January 2022, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of BMF-219 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including those with MLL/KMT2A gene arrangements or NPM1 mutations. We also plan to initiate clinical studies of BMF-219 across a range of menin dependent cancers including MM, DLBCL, and KRAS mutant lung, pancreatic, and colon tumors. In addition, subject to submission and clearance of our IND, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BMF-219 in diabetes during the second half of 2022.
In addition to BMF-219, we are utilizing our novel FUSION™ System to pioneer irreversible covalent treatments against other high-value genetic drivers of disease. We are currently advancing additional preclinical irreversible programs for the treatment of select cancers and expect to nominate our second development candidate in the first half of 2022. These programs will pursue novel protein targets that should have single agent activity and also have the potential to achieve a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with BMF-219. 
 Our Strategy – We Aim to Cure
 Our scientists have identified a series of molecular targets whose role in healthy individuals is to function quietly and efficiently, keeping this equilibrium largely undisturbed. In cancer, these proteins malfunction, thus disrupting their complex biochemical pathways, resulting in abnormal cell growth and division. When the body’s own defense mechanisms are unable to restore the healthy equilibrium, tumors and late-stage disease occur. In these tumors, the rogue proteins continue to be expressed above their normal levels. We recognize the value of precision, targeting the malfunctioning proteins through quick-acting inhibition.
 Our scientists, with extensive backgrounds in structure-driven drug discovery and development, have taken aim at these molecular targets using irreversible, covalent inhibition techniques. Most commercial drugs and clinical-stage drug candidates rely exclusively on keeping bloodstream levels at a sufficiently high value to which the patient is constantly exposed. The patient is thus subject to unwanted side effects caused by the drug’s potentially indiscriminate activity against other targets that are not themselves out of equilibrium. In contrast, our approach specifically employs weak spots in the molecular target that can form a covalent or extremely tight bond with the drug, but in such a way that the inhibitor-protein complex is then taken out of action quickly. The only way then for the rogue protein to return is through de novo synthesis. This allows the drug to be dosed in short bursts, to do its job, and then disappear instead of having to be always present. While perhaps counterintuitive, this approach affords an added degree of selectivity, since “innocent” targets are not exposed to the drug for any longer than necessary.
 With a wealth of experience in delivering versatile, multibillion dollar irreversible inhibitor drugs such as IMBRUVICA®, we believe our team is uniquely positioned to leverage this knowledge in wide variety of unmet medical needs.

FUSION™ System Discovery Platform / Background on Irreversible Covalent Inhibition
 Background on Irreversible Covalent Drugs 
 An irreversible covalent small molecule drug is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein through a combination of non-covalent and covalent interactions and can either stimulate or inhibit target protein function. Reversible drugs, which make up the majority of approved drugs, exert their action by establishing an equilibrium between free drug, target protein, and drug-target complex. Therefore, a reversible inhibitor, by definition, can allow an inhibited drug-protein complex to convert back to free drug and active protein unless sufficient concentration of free drug is present in the local environment. This need for constant coverage typically requires continuous systemic exposure, which can pose safety and tolerability challenges. 
 Forming an irreversible covalent bond between a target protein and irreversible covalent drug can be described as a two-step process. First, the compound creates a reversible, non-covalent bond to the target protein that can enable an irreversible, covalent bond by placing a reactive atom on the drug compound close to a complementary reactive atom on the target protein. The second step involves the formation of a specific and long-lived covalent bond between the complementary moieties, resulting in a complex that persists throughout the lifetime of the target protein and effectively permanently disables target protein function.

Key Advantages of Irreversible Covalent Drugs 
 Since the discovery of aspirin in 1899, irreversible drugs have shown the potential to offer a number of potential safety, tolerability, and efficacy advantages over conventional reversible drugs through multiple mechanisms. 
 

Persistent site occupancy of a marketed irreversible inhibitor observed in the absence of sustained drug exposure. 
 Beyond aspirin and ibrutinib, a number of irreversible inhibitors have been approved by the FDA, including sofosbuvir (marketed as SOVALDI® for hepatitis C virus), tenofovir (marketed as VIREAD® for hepatitis B virus), osimertinib (marketed as TAGRISSO® for NSCLC), and bortezomib (marketed as VELCADE® for MM and mantle cell lymphoma). 
 Challenges in Developing Irreversible Covalent Drugs 
 Despite the potential advantages of irreversible covalent drugs, the majority of approved drugs are reversible binders. The inherent challenges in creating irreversible covalent drugs present significant barriers to entry to discover and develop these molecules. The key challenges in developing irreversible covalent drugs include: 

• | Complexity. The discovery and development of irreversible covalent drugs requires significant structural knowledge and medicinal chemistry capabilities, including the ability to construct complex novel chemical scaffolds. In addition, not all disease-causing proteins have the properties necessary for the application of irreversible covalent binding. While advancements in structural knowledge of the proteome provides greater opportunity to identify potential targets for irreversible covalent binding, we believe the lack of specialized medicinal chemistry expertise needed to leverage this knowledge has impeded the development of irreversible covalent drugs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety and toxicity. While the irreversible covalent binding modality can provide a high degree of selectivity, poorly conceived molecules with promiscuous binding profiles can pose a risk of significant off-target interactions and safety concerns. Given this significant and long-standing challenge, without the structural biology and irreversible covalent binding chemistry expertise, drug developers have historically been discouraged from pursuing irreversible covalent binders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At Biomea, we believe we are positioned to leverage the significant expertise, foundational knowledge, and capabilities that our management team first acquired while developing ibrutinib and that we have expanded and refined over the last three years to create our FUSION™ System discovery platform.

The system also has the capability to create a novel non-covalent inhibitor, which we may advance depending on the target. We have described some of the differences between the FUSION™ System and traditional small molecule drug discovery below:

Our Initial Focus: Menin 
 Menin is a protein important to transcriptional regulation, impacting major processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA damage repair. It plays an essential role in oncogenic signaling in subgroups of genetically defined leukemias, such as MLL-r, and other cancers dependent on menin. The BROAD Institute elucidated the dependence of menin on various cancer types and has made this work available for public access via the DEPMAP portal. The dependence of various cancers on menin is shown in the figure below. 

BROAD Institute DEPMAP highlights the dependency of various tumor types on Menin (MEN1)
 As shown above, DLBCL; MM; Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors (including Acute Leukemias); and Solid Tumors (KRAS mutant) had the highest dependence on menin. We believe that disrupting the function of menin in these tumor types is a viable therapeutic approach. The menin complex plays a critical role in MYC-dependent oncogenic signaling, whereby menin enhances MYC-mediated transcription to promote cancer progression. Inhibition of menin is a novel approach to cancer treatment. The figure below highlights the menin complex partner / downstream effector that is associated with each of the respective indications that could benefit from treatment with an irreversible covalent menin inhibitor.

 Depiction of target patient populations grouped based on the relevant menin complex partner or downstream effector
 Menin & MLL – Acute Leukemias (MLL-r and NPM1 Mutant)
 MLL-r leukemias are characterized by MLL gene (encoded by the gene KMT2A) translocation abnormalities. These abnormalities result in the formation of fusion genes encoding fusion proteins comprised of MLL1 and a corresponding fusion partner domain. The interaction of these fusion proteins with menin drives the expression of downstream target genes such as HOXA9 and MEIS1, triggering leukemic cell proliferation. 
 12


Menin binds directly to the conserved N-terminus of MLL proteins, making it a promising target that could potentially be exploited consistently by a menin inhibitor therapeutic. Preventing the MLL proteins from binding to menin has been shown to abolish the oncogenic effects in vitro and in vivo as shown in the figure below.
 

 Depiction of leukemic pathway associated with aberrant menin-MLL fusion complex. 
 Approximately 20,000 and 6,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed annually with AML and ALL, respectively. MLL-r leukemia has limited therapeutic options and affects approximately 10% of acute leukemias in adults and approximately 70% of acute leukemias in infants. In addition to MLL-r, MLL signaling in some forms of MLL wild-type (MLL-wt) AML have also been implicated, including those bearing independent oncogenic mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1), a molecular chaperone, and DNA-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), a methyl transferase. These subpopulations together represent approximately 45% of AML cases. 
 Patients with MLL rearrangements often suffer from failure of induction therapy or disease relapse, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. In pediatric AML, the five-year event-free survival rate on average is 44% but ranges between 11% and 92% depending on the MLL-translocation subtypes. In ALL, the five-year survival rate for people aged 20 and older is approximately 37% and for people under the age of 20 it is approximately 89%. However, pediatric MLL-r ALL patients fare much worse, with four-year survival rates as low as 10%, compared to 64% for those without MLL rearrangements. 
 A perhaps more dire area of unmet need is relapsed/refractory AML. Despite evolving insights into the pathogenesis of AML, over 11,000 patients with AML die each year from the disease in the United States. Relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure. The five-year overall survival (OS) for adult patients with AML after disease relapse is only approximately 10%. Furthermore, a published study showed that approximately 20% of patients demonstrated primary induction failure adding even more patients to this refractory category. Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is considered to be the only reliable option with curative potential, with OS estimated between 15% to 25% three to five years post-transplant. To improve overall quality of life for patients, physicians are favoring oral targeted agents and strategies that avoid intensive chemotherapy and prolonged inpatient admissions. Key in this effort is a focus on molecular testing to identify the potential for targeted therapies. 
 Given the involvement of MLL and NPM1 in a high percentage of acute leukemias, and the poor clinical outcomes provided by available treatments, we believe a new treatment that can inhibit the function of both targets by disrupting or preventing interactions with menin could address this unmet need. 
 Menin & MYC – Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), and KRAS Solid Tumors (Lung, Pancreatic, and Colorectal)
 MYC is a transcription factor that is implicated in oncogenesis and typically regulates genes associated with cell cycle, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In fact, MYC is constitutively and aberrantly expressed in over 70% of human cancers. Notably, MYC appears to play a key role in the functioning of many cancer cells, 
 13


including DLBCL, MM, and KRAS solid tumors (Colorectal, Pancreatic, and Lung). MYC is aberrantly expressed or translocated in relapsed / refractory DLBCL and MM and is a major downstream effector of KRAS mutant tumors. Menin has been shown to play an essential role in the MYC transcriptional complex, which leads to menin-mediated enhancement of MYC target gene expression in cancer cells. The figure below highlights the role of menin in mediating MYC target gene expression.

Depiction of the role of menin in the MYC transcriptional complex, facilitating the expression of MYC target genes 
 DLBCL is the most common subtype of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. DLBCL starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes and it usually grows in lymph nodes. Every year, approximately ~18,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with DLBCL. Following initial treatment with standard chemotherapy, approximately 70% of patients have a complete response and approximately 50% of patients are cured. There is a substantial unmet need for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL as median overall survival is between six and seven months in this group. Double Hit Lymphomas (DHL), Triple Hit Lymphomas (THL), and Double Expressor Lymphomas (DEL) are high grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBLs) that have high MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 dependency. Based on their aggressive nature, DHL, THL, and DEL represent a large portion of the relapsed or refractory DLBCL population. 
 MM is a cancer of plasma cells, which make antibodies (immunoglobulins) and are mainly located in the bone marrow. As cancerous cells migrate from the bone marrow, organ damage due to excess immunoglobulins in bones and blood and weakening of bones are common features. Approximately 35,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with MM each year and the five-year relative survival rate is ~56% (Source: NCI SEER Data). While many therapeutic options are available to patients, a subset of highly refractory patients exists. In these patients, overall survival is as low as 6 months. Additionally, it is estimated that more than 60% of MM patients have menin dependent genetic drivers (MYC addicted or driven) and that these drivers are more common in the relapsed or refractory setting. 
 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, representing approximately 84% of all lung cancer cases or approximately 200,000 cases in the U.S. each year. Additionally, the five-year survival rate of NSCLC is approximately 25%. While lung cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the U.S. based on incidence, lung cancer contributes to the highest number of annual cancer deaths in the U.S.. KRAS is a key node in the RAS signaling pathway, which can be oncogenic. KRAS is the most frequent oncogene in NSCLC, occurring in approximately 30% of patients with NSCLC. Notably, RAS signaling is known to result in active MYC, which can facilitate pro-tumor transcriptional processes. KRAS-targeted inhibitors have shown efficacy in KRAS mutant NSCLC patients in clinical trials. 
 Pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer in the U.S., representing approximately 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer with a very low five-year survival rate of approximately 11%, indicating that there is a large unmet need. It is rarely diagnosed early, contributing to the low survival rate. Among patients with pancreatic cancer, RAS mutations (including KRAS) occur in up to approximately 98% of patients. 
 Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common form of cancer in the U.S., representing approximately 150,000 cases in the U.S. each year. These cancers start in the rectum or the colon and can be diagnosed/identified early, even potentially as noncancerous polyps. The five-year survival rate of CRC is approximately 65%. Among other mutations, KRAS mutations occur in approximately 50% of patients with CRC.

Menin & Beta-Cell Biology – Diabetes 
 Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a reduced ability to produce insulin and/or by a dysregulated response to insulin and affects nearly 34 million people in the U.S. (Source: CDC). Diabetes is grouped into a few clinical categories based on etiology or timing of diagnosis according to the latest guidance from the American Diabetes Association. Accounting for 1.6 million diagnosed patients in the U.S., type 1 diabetes is due to autoimmune beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood. Type 2 diabetes has been diagnosed in approximately 25.3 million people in the U.S. and is due to a progressive loss of adequate beta-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance. The primary treatment goal is to achieve glycemic control by reducing HbA1c (A1c), a marker for the amount of sugar in the bloodstream, to 6.5% or lower. Glycemic control is a validated approach to delaying disease progression, which leads to significant and potentially fatal renal, cardiac, neurological, and ophthalmic comorbidities.
 Loss of functional beta-cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes — type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and type 2 diabetes (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta-cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta-cell mass and function are diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta-cell turnover / beta-cell growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal healthy beta-cells. Notably, it has previously been shown that knocking out the gene responsible for the creation of menin (MEN1) has been observed to produce profound glycemic control in diabetic animal models (see below). Based on these and other scientific findings, we explored the potential for menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to permanently halt or reverse progression of type 2 diabetes.

 BMF-219 
 Our lead product candidate, BMF-219, is designed to be a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, irreversible covalent inhibitor of menin that disrupts the protein-protein interaction between menin and MLL. We are developing BMF-219 for the treatment of cancers that are highly dependent on menin, including leukemias containing the MLL fusion protein. In preclinical studies, administration of BMF-219 has resulted in robust anti-tumor responses across a range of liquid and solid tumor models, including MLL-r AML, NPM1 mutant AML, MYC driven/addicted liquid tumors (e.g., DLBCL and MM), and KRAS mutant colorectal, lung, and pancreatic tumors. Based on our preclinical findings, our irreversible covalent approach may have significant advantages over reversible inhibitors, including selectivity, potency, durability, and safety. We filed and received clearance for our IND in the third quarter of 2021, supporting our clinical development efforts in liquid tumors, and announced that 
 15


we had dosed the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating BMF-219 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias, including those with MLL1/KMT2A gene rearrangements or NPM1 mutations in January 2022. We intend to file a separate IND to support our solid tumor indications in the second half of 2022.
 Target Engagement Studies: Gene Expression 
 Published preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction leads to reduction in MEN1 (the gene that encodes menin) transcription, resulting in down regulation of MEIS1, HOXA9, and DMNT3A, which are common gene signatures for menin-MLL, and differentiation of leukemic cells into myeloid cells. Our lead product candidate, BMF-219, is intended to irreversibly inhibit the interaction between menin and wild type MLL and MLL fusions. 
 In preclinical studies, administration of BMF-219 has resulted in the inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction in multiple cancer cell models with known dependency on menin binding for survival. We characterized the molecular responses following treatment with BMF-219 across multiple model cell lines, including MOLM-13 cells in culture. MOLM-13 is an AML cell line with a KMT2A-MLLT3 (MLL-AF9) fusion. 
 As reflected in the figure below, in this model we observed substantial down regulation of MEN1 along with MEIS1, HOXA9, and DNMT3A, which are common gene signatures for menin-MLL and NPM1 altered leukemias. Published studies of reversible menin inhibitors have shown down regulation of signature genes after six days of inhibition. To evaluate target engagement and explore potential differences in onset of action for our reversible and irreversible covalent menin inhibitors, we evaluated expression levels at 6 and 24 hours following treatment. Our reversible inhibitor showed limited impact on signature genes over 24 hours, but we observed rapid down regulation of menin dependent genes for BMF-219 and observed up to approximately 80% reduction in readout genes by six hours and approximately 95% reduction at 24 hours compared to control. 
 

 Reduction in menin dependent gene expression demonstrated target engagement. Profiling of signature genes in menin-MLL and NPM1 altered leukemias shows rapid down-regulation upon treatment with BMF-219, an irreversible covalent menin inhibitor. Treatment with BMF-05, a reversible menin inhibitor, shows limited impact on signature genes similar to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control at these time points, which is consistent with published findings for other reversible menin inhibitors. Y-axis represents Transcripts Per Million (TPM). 
 Published preclinical studies have also shown that disruption of the menin-MLL interaction led to differentiation of leukemic cells to myeloid cells. As a result, we have tested reversible and irreversible covalent menin inhibitors in MOLM-13 cells to determine if treatment would promote differentiation, as exhibited by an increase in integrin subunit alpha M (ITGAM), which encodes CD11b, a surface marker associated with myeloid differentiation. As reflected in the figure below, at 24 hours following administration, we observed dose dependent elevation of myeloid marker gene expression with BMF-219 treatment. Meanwhile, comparable exposures of reversible menin inhibitors (BMF-05, BMF-13, BMF-214 three of our proprietary reversible menin inhibitors) reflected no change from vehicle controls. However, the reversible inhibitors were able to upregulate ITGAM at a 10-fold increase in exposure. While we believe these results support our hypothesis regarding the role of the menin pathway, they 
 16


also highlight the potential need for reversible inhibitors to have high clinical exposures in order to achieve sufficient menin suppression to affect disease. 
 

Responses of myeloid differentiation marker ITGAM at 24 hours demonstrated target engagement. Y-axis represents the Transcripts Per Million (TPM). Data are presented for DMSO vehicle control, proprietary reversible menin inhibitors (BMF-05, BMF-13, BMF-214), and BMF-219. 
 We explored the impact of BMF-219 treatment on key oncogenic genes in MOLM-13 cells in preclinical models. Significant changes in gene expression of BCL-2, MYC, and HOXA9 were observed after 24 hours of treatment with BMF-219. The figure below compares gene expression data in MOLM-13 cells after 16 hours of treatment with KO-539, a reversible menin inhibitor, that was published at the ASH Annual Meeting in 2021.

Comparison of gene expression data for key genes in MOLM-13 cells. Data for BMF-219 was gathered after 24 hours. of BMF-219 treatment at 500 nM and 1,000nM concentrations and was generated by the Biomea team. Data for KO-539 was gathered after 16 hours. of KO-539 treatment at 250 nM and 1,000nM concentrations and was generated by a research group at MD Anderson and subsequently published at the ASH Annual Meeting in 2021.
 In-vitro Studies 
 To evaluate potential activity of the irreversible covalent menin inhibitor BMF-219 in leukemia models, we examined the impact of menin inhibition on metabolic activity and cell survival. As reflected in the figures below, treatment with BMF-219 demonstrated rapid shut down of metabolic activity, which was sustained over the 14-hour study duration. BMF-219 responses were superior to tested reversible menin inhibitors (BMF-05 and MI-503) with respect to both onset and durability of metabolic suppression.

Metabolic Activity


Metabolic activity in menin inhibitor treated leukemia cell lines reflected rapid and durable responses following administration of irreversible covalent menin inhibitor BMF-219 (560nM exposure of all compounds). Y-axis represents fluorescence units measured as an output of ATP production, a measure of viable cells. 
 Treatment with BMF-219 also led to apoptosis in menin driven leukemia models, resulting in a notable reduction in cell survival. Responses were observed for BMF-219 treatment at the lowest tested doses across all cell lines, while the reversible inhibitors showed limited responses at the lowest dose and were unable to eliminate tumor cells at any tested dose. 
 
Cell Survival 
 

Survival assay across AML cell lines after seven days shows differentiated responses to irreversible covalent menin inhibitor BMF-219 relative to reversible inhibitors. 
 We have also conducted cell proliferation assays on a panel of well-characterized leukemia cell lines to evaluate the potency of BMF-219. The panel included: MLL-AF4 translocated, internal tandem FLT3 duplicated bi-phenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia (i.e. ALL/AML) cell line MV4;11; MLL-AF9 translocated, internal tandem FLT3 duplicated AML cell line MOLM-13; and NPM1-mutated AML cell line OCI-AML3. We are comparing in the figure below the cell killing ability of BMF-219 in leukemic cells to the cell killing of reversible inhibitors in similar 
 18


experiments. The data for reversible inhibitors on the right of the figure was generated by a research group at MD Anderson and was published at the ASH Annual Meeting in 2021. 

Cell killing effect of BMF-219 in acute leukemia cell lines compared against similar data from reversible menin inhibitors published at the ASH Annual Meeting in 2021. 
 In addition to impacting leukemic cell lines, menin is a known dependency in other liquid tumors, including MM and DLBCL. Menin dependency has also been seen in multiple solid tumors including Ewing’s sarcoma and KRAS driven cancers. As part of our ongoing discovery efforts, we screened BMF-219 against a panel of tumor models and observed potent growth inhibition in multiple menin-dependent cancer cell lines, including MM.

We also explored the potential potency of BMF-219 in KRAS dependent tumors using a long-term proliferation assay. A representative cell survival time course from a G12C KRAS mutation driven pancreatic cancer line (MIA-PaCa-2, 0.56 µM doses) shows the effects of treatment with the irreversible covalent inhibitor BMF-219. A broader panel of these studies demonstrated potent growth inhibition in multiple models covering both G12C and G12D KRAS mutations.

 In summary, we have screened the effects of BMF-219 across a range of cancer cell lines and observed potent growth inhibition. These findings support our belief that BMF-219 has significant potential to address a broad range of cancers.
 Ex-vivo Efficacy Results 
 Continuing our focus on the well-characterized menin dependency in leukemia, we investigated patient derived AML samples and the impact of reversible and irreversible covalent inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction on proliferation. As reflected in the figure below, irreversible covalent inhibition with BMF-219 and BMF-T2 (a derivative of BMF-219) led to dramatic growth inhibition and showed substantial advantages over the selected reversible inhibitors. 
 20





Treatment of patient derived AML cells with menin inhibitors showed potent inhibition of proliferation with irreversible covalent drugs (BMF-219 and BMF-T2) versus reversible drugs (BMF-5, BMF-13, MI-503) at 1µM exposure, six days.
 
In comparison, to achieve similar levels of growth inhibition, the selected reversible inhibitors studied required dose concentrations approximately ten-fold greater than our respective IC90 values. We believe these findings support our hypothesis that an irreversible covalent inhibitor could potentially provide greater therapeutic benefit at lower exposure-levels versus reversible inhibitors. 
 


Treatment of patient derived AML cells with reversible menin inhibitors at drug exposures 10-fold greater than IC90 (10µM) showed robust inhibition of proliferation at six days. 
 21


In-vivo Efficacy Results 
 A xenograft model using a MV4;11 leukemia cell line was used to evaluate the potency of BMF-219 as a single agent. We utilized a luciferase transduced MV4;11 model over sub-cutaneous models as we believe the disseminated model better reflects the normal etiology of leukemias, including homing of leukemic cells to the bone marrow and spleen. Also, the disseminated model offered the ability to frequently monitor disease progression through fluorescence imaging which provided a more detailed understanding of the kinetics of the observed response to therapy. 
 Disseminated MV4;11-luc models were run in female NSG mice. Mice were inoculated with xenograft cancer cells at high levels (1x107 MV4;11 cells) with greater than 90% viability via tail vein injection. BMF-219 or vehicle was administered (once daily) at various dose levels and via various routes (intravenously (IV), PO: 80-160 mg/kg, IP: 40-80 mg/kg). 
 As reflected in the figure below, the MV4;11-luc disseminated xenograft study showed substantial tumor reduction and survival benefit for BMF-219 treatment at both the 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg doses. Fluorescence imaging showed notable reductions in tumor burden between the control (vehicle treated) animals as compared to the BMF-219 treated animals. Both tested doses showed substantial reductions in tumor burden (-47% at 20 mg/kg; -63% at 40 mg/kg), which translated into survival benefit (over vehicle control) of 72% and 94% for the respective doses (calculated using total days of survival versus control). 
 
Fluorescence imaging of the disseminated MV4;11-luc xenograft model treated for 14 days at 40mg/kg with BMF-219 vs. control. Pseudo-colored area and intensity indicates level of tumor burden. 
 Mean body weight data from our xenograft studies provided an early assessment of safety and tolerability showing that BMF-219 treatment was generally well-tolerated at various doses in a rodent model system. BMF-219 was administered once daily at 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg via IV for 14 days and caused minimal changes in body weight from baseline or vehicle control. 
 22




Body weight with BMF-219 treatment showed limited change from baseline and vehicle controls. 
 
We have also completed seven-day, non-GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs where daily oral administration of BMF-219 showed that the compound was generally well-tolerated in both species. Additionally, our PD studies, which dosed daily up to 14 consecutive days, showed that BMF-219 was generally well-tolerated. We believe these results further support the advancement of BMF-219 into IND-enabling toxicology studies. 
 OncoPanel Screening 
 We examined the selectivity of BMF-219 for menin-dependent disease to assess potential off-target risk. We observed negligible impact of BMF-219 treatment on cell metabolism in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines that have wild type MLL, but no menin-linked mechanism for disease. We believe these findings were consistent with external studies showing that menin-MLL interaction was not generally cell-essential and only critical to survival in those cells that contain aberrant biology.

The cell lines BC-1, BCP-1, BV-173, K562, and U937 were composed of, respectively, cells that were hematopoietic (B lympho-blast), hematopoietic (B lympho-blast), leukemia (B-cell pre), hematopoietic (bone marrow), and hematopoetic (bone marrow). 
 23


Kinase Screening 
 We have also conducted extensive in-house comparative 3D structural analysis of the protein, which has revealed that the binding pocket we seek to target on menin showed limited structural similarity to some tyrosine kinases known to be of functional relevance in hematological cancers. At a standard compound test concentration of 0.1 µM, BMF-219 displayed high selectivity and limited off-target kinase inhibition. Of the 169 kinases tested, only six showed any inhibition by any of our novel molecules tested. Furthermore, only two wild type kinases showed greater than 50% inhibition upon treatment with BMF-219. We believe this result supports the potential of our FUSION™ System to generate target-specific compounds. 
Glutathione Reactivity 
 We have also employed the widely used glutathione (GSH) reactivity assay to investigate potential non-specific binding liabilities from electrophilic residues necessary to enable irreversible covalent binding. The assay measures the depletion of the tested drug as it forms non-specific complexes with the strong nucleophile GSH and returns drug half-life (t1/2) as a readout. Drugs with limited non-specific interactions have long half-lives, as the drug does not get consumed in a reaction with GSH. In such studies, BMF-219 showed negligible interaction with the strong nucleophile GSH and showed less reactivity than the approved irreversible covalent drugs omeprazole and neratinib. We believe this result, if replicated in humans, could lead to less non-specific binding and potential off-target effects for BMF-219. The table below shows GSH reactivity studies demonstrating limited non-specific binding liability of BMF compounds. 1µM of compound was incubated with 5 mM of glutathione (5,000 eq). 
Safety Screen
In order to investigate the safety of BMF-219, we have assayed a selective group of compounds (including BMF-219) at 10 µM on the SafetyScreen 44 panel (CEREP/Eurofins Discovery). This panel was created from the collective experience of multiple large pharmaceutical companies. Our findings showed no meaningful impact (greater than 50% activation or inhibition) of BMF-219 across these key safety assays. 
 Drug Properties
We believe the results observed for BMF-219 in our preclinical studies suggest the potential for this compound to be further evaluated as an oral, once-daily treatment for menin driven cancers. With limited formulation work, the compound showed favorable PK and PD results half-life, area under curve and bioavailability that enabled sufficient exposure for us to conduct in vivo efficacy and safety studies with oral dosing in mouse, rat, and dog studies. We also tested the metabolic stability of BMF-219 and have observed no cytochrome (CYP) inhibition to date. 
BMF-219 Tested in Two Diabetes Animal Models 
 Loss of functional Beta-cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes — type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and type 2 diabetes (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta-cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, Beta-cell mass and function are diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on Beta-cell turnover / Beta-cell growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal healthy Beta-cells. Notably, it has previously been shown that knocking out the gene responsible for the creation of menin (MEN1) produced profound glycemic control in diabetic animal 
 24


models. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea explored the potential for menin inhibition with BMF-219 as a viable therapeutic approach to permanently halt or reverse progression of type 2 diabetes.
 We conducted two diabetes animal experiments to measure the potential impact of BMF-219 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat, a widely studied model of obesity and insulin resistance in rats, and the Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes (STZ) induced rat, a widely studied model by which diabetes is induced using an antibiotic (STZ) that produces pancreatic islet β-cell destruction. In both models, we observed that BMF-219 worked to normalize glucose levels in the majority of animals after just two weeks of treatment. Notably, the majority of the effect was maintained despite complete washout of BMF-219.

 Clinical Development Plan
In September 2021, we announced that the FDA had cleared our IND application to begin a Phase 1 trial to assess BMF-219’s control of menin’s negative impact on patients with relapsed/refractory AML and ALL. The Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial of BMF-219 will assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of BMF-219 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia including those with an MLL/KM2TA gene rearrangement or NPM1 mutation. The clinical development plan includes the initiation of additional clinical trials of BMF-219 in the following liquid tumors — MM and DLBCL— in the first half of 2022, and the following solid tumors — NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC) — in the fourth quarter of 2022, in each case subject to the submission and clearance of additional INDs. In addition, subject to submission and clearance of an IND, we plan to initiate a 
 25


Phase / clinical trial of BMF-219 in diabetes during the second half of 2022.


The graphic above describes potentially addressable patient populations for BMF-219 in oncology. 
 Additional Oncology Programs 
 In addition to BMF-219, we are advancing two other pre-clinical irreversible covalent programs for the treatment of select cancers and expect to nominate our second development candidate in the first half of 2022 with an IND application planned within 12 months of candidate selection. Both of these programs target clinically validated mechanisms of action and are complementary to the menin pathway. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, we believe we are currently the only company in the United States developing irreversible covalent binders specifically against menin. More broadly, we define ourselves as targeted oncology drug developers focused on irreversible covalent drugs and as such expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may be or may become interested in discovery and development of irreversible covalent binders that may compete with us against menin or related targets at scale and in an integrated way. Even if they do not advance programs with the same mechanism of action as ours, these companies could develop products or product candidates that are competitive with ours or that have a superior product profile, and may do so at a rapid pace. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of therapies that target irreversible covalent binding against protein targets of interest to us. 
 To our knowledge there are several programs that target menin in clinical development at this time; one being developed by Kura Oncology (KO-539), by Syndax Pharmaceuticals (SNDX-5613), by Janssen Pharmaceuticals (JNJ-75276617), by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals (DS-1594), by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma (DSP-5336). 
 26


Notably, KO-539 and SNDX-5613 are in clinical trials and have demonstrated preliminary Phase 1 results that support further investigation of menin as a therapeutic target. Other preclinical programs have been reported from biopharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions as well. 
 Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other targeted therapies, including small molecule, antibody, or protein degraders for the same indications that we are targeting. We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with more favorable labeling than our product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their potency, selectivity, inactivation of the target, therapeutic window, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, our ability to market and commercialize the product candidate, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as other relevant inventions and improvements that we believe to be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending provisional and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology or commercialize our product candidates. The PCT is a treaty with more than 150 contracting states that makes it possible to seek patent protection across multiple states by filing a single “international” application. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of a new drug application, plus the time between the submission date of a new drug application and the ultimate approval date. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. A patent that covers multiple products for which extension is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if any of our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for a 
 27


patent term extension on an issued patents covering the product, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for the product and other factors. Outside the U.S., similar applications for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates are available in a limited number of countries. We expect to apply for such coverage where available. There can be no assurance that the USPTO or any other patent office outside the U.S. will approve any of our applications for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our current or future pending patent applications, or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products, if approved, for an adequate amount of time. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned two issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, more than ten pending U.S. provisional patent applications, one pending PCT application, and more than twenty-five outside U.S. pending patent applications, directed to compositions of matter, methods of treatment, and methods of making with respect to our product candidates, including BMF-219. 
 Prosecution of our PCT patent application and our provisional patent applications has not commenced, and will not commence unless and until they are timely converted into U.S. non-provisional or national stage applications. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO or other foreign jurisdiction are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. Any of our pending PCT patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file national stage patent applications within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such PCT patent applications. Our provisional patent applications may never result in issued patents and are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional and/or PCT patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not timely file non-provisional or PCT patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional and PCT patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, and we intend to timely file national stage patent applications relating to our PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our current or future patent applications related to BMF-219, or any of our other product candidates, will issue as patents. If we do not successfully obtain patent protection, or, even if we do obtain patent protection, if the scope of the patent protection we obtain our product candidates or technology is not sufficiently broad, we will be unable to prevent others from using our technology or from developing or commercializing technology and products similar or identical to ours or other competing products and technologies. Additionally, even if any of our patent applications issue as patents, the patents covering our proprietary technologies and our product candidates would be expected to expire between 2039 to 2042. 
 In addition to patent applications, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. In particular, we consider various aspects of our irreversible binder discovery platform to constitute our trade secrets and know-how. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any person to whom we disclose such information. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our product candidates or any future proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”

License and Partnership Agreements 
 As of December 31, 2021, we do not have any license or partnership agreements related to any of our programs. As these programs and our business evolves we may consider entering into a potential license or partnership. A potential partnership could provide non-dilutive funding and access to additional capabilities and expertise that a partner could provide to enhance the overall probability of program success. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical studies, as well as for clinical trials of BMF-219 and other programs. This arrangement is also expected for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Certain of our suppliers of ingredients, raw materials, components and materials are single source suppliers. All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
Commercialization 
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine. 
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of drug products. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory studies, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29



 
• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30


In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 In addition, during the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are 
 31


in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use (ETASU), such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, fails to keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive 
 32


Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date. 
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population of 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other potential benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 33


Post-approval Requirements 
 Drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling. 
 Other United States Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United 
 34


States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 Regulatory exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 The FDCA also provides three years of exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 In addition, drugs can also obtain pediatric exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (FCA), which can be enforced through civil “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating these statutes without actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;

• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the ACA and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extended to include payments and transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services.

Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:

 
• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA: 

• | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, 
 37


and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
  
• | On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Individual states have also been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care

programs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services.
