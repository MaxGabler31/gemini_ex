General
The manufacturing operations of our Ranor subsidiary are situated on approximately 65 acres in North Central Massachusetts. Our 145,000 square foot facility houses state-of-the-art equipment which gives us the capability to manufacture products as large as 100 tons. We offer a full range of services required to transform raw material into precision finished products. Our manufacturing capabilities include: fabrication operations (cutting, press and roll forming, assembly, welding, heat treating, blasting and painting) and machining operations including CNC (computer numerical controlled) horizontal and vertical milling centers. We also provide support services to our manufacturing capabilities: manufacturing engineering (planning, fixture and tooling development, and manufacturing), quality control (inspection and testing), materials procurement, production control (scheduling, project management and expediting), and final assembly.
All manufacturing at Ranor’s facility is done in accordance with our written quality assurance program, which meets specific national codes, and international codes, standards, and specifications. The standards used for each customer project are specific to that customer’s needs, and we have implemented such standards into our manufacturing operations.
The manufacturing operations of our Stadco subsidiary are situated in an industrial warehouse and office location comprised of approximately 183,000 square feet in Los Angeles, California. At this site, Stadco manufactures large flight-critical components on several high-profile commercial and military aircraft programs, including military helicopters. It has been a critical supplier to a blue-chip customer base that includes some of the largest OEMs and prime contractors in the defense and aerospace industries. Stadco also provides tooling, customized molds, fixtures, jigs and dies used in the production of aircraft components and has one of the largest electron beam welding machines set up in the United States, allowing it to weld thick pieces of titanium and other metals.
Products
We manufacture a wide variety of products pursuant to customer contracts and based on individual customer needs. We can also provide manufacturing engineering services to assist customers in optimizing their engineering designs for manufacturing efficiency. We do not design the products we manufacture, but rather manufacture according to “build-to-print” requirements specified by our customers. Accordingly, we do not distribute the products that we manufacture on the open market, and we do not market any specific products on an on-going basis. We do not own the intellectual property rights to any proprietary marketed product, and we do not manufacture products in anticipation of orders. Manufacturing operations do not commence on any project before we receive a customer’s purchase order. We only consider contracts that cover specific products within the capability of our resources.
Although we seek continuous production programs with predictable cost structures that provide long-term integrated solutions for our customers, our activities include a variety of both custom-based and production-based requirements. The custom-based work is typically either a prototype or unique, one-of-a-kind product. The production-based work is repeat work or a single product with multiple quantity releases.
Changes in market demand for our manufacturing expertise can be significant and sudden and require us to be able to adapt to the collective needs of the customers and industries that we serve. Understanding this dynamic, we believe we have developed the capability to transform our workforce to manufacture products for customers across different industries.
We serve customers in the defense, aerospace, nuclear, medical and precision industrial markets. Examples of products we have manufactured within such industries during recent years include, but are not limited to, custom components for ships and submarines, military helicopters, aerospace equipment, components for nuclear power plants and components for large scale medical systems. We manage and report financial information through our two reportable segments, Ranor and Stadco.
Source of Supply
Our manufacturing operations are partly dependent on the availability of raw materials. Most of our contracts with customers require the use of customer-supplied raw materials in the manufacture of their product. Accordingly, raw material requirements vary with each contract and are dependent upon customer requirements and specifications. We have established relationships with numerous suppliers. When we do buy raw materials, we endeavor to establish alternate sources of material supply to reduce our dependency on any one supplier and strive to maintain a minimal raw material inventory.

Our projects include the manufacturing of products from various traditional as well as specialty metal alloys. These materials may include, but are not limited to steel, nickel, monel, inconel, aluminum, stainless steel, and other alloys. Certain of these materials are subject to long-lead time delivery schedules. Since the beginning of calendar year 2020, we have experienced some adverse effects to our supply sources because of the Coronavirus Disease pandemic, or COVID-19. In particular, the Company has seen lead-times for delivery of certain critical supplies extended. While the overall situation has improved, we may continue to experience sporadic delays and supply shortages for specific items. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, or fiscal 2022, two suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, or fiscal 2021, two suppliers accounted for 10% or more of our purchased material.
Marketing
While we have significant customer concentration, we endeavor to broaden our customer base as well as the industries we serve. We market to our existing customer base and also initiate contacts with new potential customers through various sources including personal contacts, customer referrals, and referrals from other businesses. A significant portion of our business is the result of competitive bidding processes, and a significant portion of our business is from contract negotiation. We believe that the reputation we have developed with our current customers represents an important part of our marketing effort.
Requests for quotations received from customers are reviewed to determine the specific requirements and our ability to meet such requirements. Quotations are prepared by estimating the material and labor costs and assessing our current backlog to determine our delivery commitments. Competitive bid quotations are submitted to the customer for review and award of contract. Negotiation bids typically require the submission of additional information to substantiate the quotation. The bidding process can range from several weeks for a competitive bid to several months for a negotiation bid before the customer awards a contract.
Research and Product Development
Many of our customers generate drawings illustrating their projected unit design and technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are limited and focused on delivering robust production solutions to such projected unit design and technology requirements. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. For these reasons, we incurred no expenses for research and development in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
Principal Customers
A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. The balance of our business consists of discrete projects for numerous other customers. As industry and market demand changes, our major customers may also change. Our ten largest customers generated approximately 90% and 99% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Our group of largest customers can change from year to year. Our largest single customer in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was a prime defense contractor and accounted for 20% and 17% of our net sales during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Our defense customers are engaged in the development, delivery and support of advanced defense, security and aerospace systems, including the U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class fast attack submarine program and the U.S. Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program. We also manufacture large flight-critical components on several high-profile commercial and military aircraft programs, including military helicopters. We also serve customers who supply components to the nuclear power industry, and in our industrial sector, we build large-scale medical device components and assemblies for installation at certain medical institutions.
We historically have experienced, and continue to experience, customer concentration. A significant loss of business from our largest customer or a combination of several of our significant customers could result in lower operating profitability and/or operating losses if we are unable to replace such lost revenue from other sources. The revenue derived from all of our customers in the designated industry groups for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are displayed in the table below:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

On March 31, 2022, we had a backlog of orders totaling approximately $47.3 million. We expect to deliver the backlog over the course of the next two to three fiscal years. The comparable backlog on March 31, 2021 was $18.6 million.
Competition
We face competition from both domestic and foreign entities in the manufacture of metal fabricated and machined precision components and equipment. The industry in which we compete is fragmented with no one dominant player. We compete against companies that are both larger and smaller than us in size and capacity. Some competitors may be better known, have greater resources at their disposal, and have lower production costs. For certain products, being a domestic manufacturer may play a role in determining whether we are awarded a certain contract. For example, we face limited foreign competition for our defense products. For other products and markets, we may be competing against foreign manufacturers who have a lower cost of production. If a contracting party has a relationship with a vendor and is required to place a contract for bids, the preferred vendor may provide or assist in the development of the specification for the product which may be tailored to that vendor’s products. In such event, we would be at a disadvantage in seeking to obtain that contract. We believe that customers focus on such factors as the quality of work, the reputation of the vendor, the perception of the vendor’s ability to meet the required schedule, and price in selecting a vendor for their products. We believe that our strengths in these areas allow us to compete effectively, and that as a result, we are one of a select group of companies that can provide the products and services we are able to provide.
Government Regulations
We provide a significant portion of our manufacturing services as a subcontractor to prime government contractors. Such prime government contractors are subject to government procurement and acquisition regulations which give the government the right to terminate these contracts for convenience, certain renegotiation rights, and rights of inspection. Any government action which affects our customers who are prime government contractors would affect us.
Because of the nature and use of our products, we are subject to compliance with quality assurance programs, compliance with which is a condition for our ability to bid on government contracts and subcontracts. We believe we are in compliance with all of these programs.
We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturing operations, such as federal and state occupational health and safety laws, and environmental laws, which are discussed in more detail below under “-Environmental Compliance.”
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated by those laws and the filing of reports with environmental agencies, and we are subject to periodic inspections to monitor our compliance. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. As part of our normal business practice, we are required to develop and file reports and maintain logbooks that document all environmental issues within our organization. We may engage outside consultants to assist us in keeping current on developments in environmental regulations. Expenditures for environmental compliance purposes during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were not material.

Occupational Health and Safety Laws
Our business and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect our employees. Due to the nature of manufacturing, we are subject to substantial regulations related to safety in the workplace. In addition to the requirements of the state government of Massachusetts and California and the local governments having jurisdiction over our plant, we must comply with federal health and safety regulations, the most significant of which are enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”).
Further, our manufacturing and other business operations and facilities are subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations including supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, transportation and other laws or regulations relating to health and safety requirements, including COVID-19 safety and prevention. Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local labor laws relating to employee privacy, wage and hour matters, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security and privacy.
It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance. Expenditures for compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were not material.
Intellectual Property Rights
Presently, we have no registered intellectual property rights other than certain trademarks for our name and other business and marketing materials. In the course of our business, we develop know-how for use in the manufacturing process. Although we have non-disclosure policies in place with respect to our personnel and in our contractual relationships, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to this know-how.
Human Capital Resources
The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a workforce of skilled employees at all levels of our organization. We provide our employees base wages and salaries that we believe are competitive and consistent with employee positions, and work with local, regional, and state-wide agencies to facilitate workforce hiring and development initiatives.
As of March 31, 2022, we had 159 employees, of whom all are full time employees. At Ranor and Stadco, 24 and 21 employees are salaried, and 68 and 46 employees are hourly, respectively. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
In connection with the outbreak of COVID-19, our production and support workforce continued to work in-person at our facility to provide vital products and services to our customers, while many of our employees in support and administrative functions have effectively worked in-person and remotely since mid-March 2020.
