ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
The Company is the holding company for Essex Bank (the “Bank”), a Virginia state bank with 26 full-service offices in Virginia and Maryland. The Bank also operates one loan production office in Virginia.
 
The Bank was established in 1926. The Bank engages in a general commercial banking business and provides a wide range of financial services primarily to individuals, small businesses and larger commercial companies, including individual and commercial demand and time deposit accounts, commercial and industrial loans, consumer and small business loans, real estate and mortgage loans, investment services, on-line and mobile banking products, and cash management services.
 
Essex Services, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. Essex Services and its financial consultants offer a broad range of investment products and alternatives through an affiliation with Infinex Investments, Inc., an independent broker-dealer. It also offers insurance products through an ownership interest in Bankers Insurance, LLC, an independent insurance agency.
 
The Company’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “ESXB”.
 
STRATEGY
 
The Company operates in some of the strongest growth markets in Virginia and Maryland. Its operating strategy has been to provide the products and services of the larger financial institutions, but delivered with the individual service focus of a small community bank. This strategy has allowed the Company to have significant organic growth in its core markets.
 
The Company’s markets are geographically diverse enough to spread economic risk throughout a number of different customer bases. Operating under the individual community delivery philosophy, the Company seeks to enhance customer relationships through superior products delivered with extraordinary service, while maintaining a prudent approach to credit quality and risk controls. The Company’s associates are the most important element in its strategy for success, and therefore there is significant focus on training and building a team-oriented environment. In a constantly changing world, competition remains intense among community banks. One of the features that sets the Company apart from other organizations is the ability and desire to give superior personal service to customers.
 
The Company continues to expand on its internal “Growing to Win” campaign and engage its associates to determine and reflect on the core values that the Company wants to deliver to associates, customers and shareholders. The Company’s mission statement is “To provide financial inspiration through intriguingly unique experiences that educate and empower action”. What makes the Company intriguingly unique is the consistent delivery of core values to the customers and the communities of which it is a part. The Company believes that this strategy not only gives a competitive advantage over larger banks, but also over web-based financial technology companies.
 
Building a strong and cohesive culture for the Company is a primary objective of management. The Company’s strategic focus on offering a broad array of products delivered with individual service has resulted in expanded market presence, earning growth and increased value for shareholders. Since this strategy has been historically successful, management believes that it will continue to provide solid results. Additionally, the Company has been focused on controlling risks and allowing growth in a safe and sound manner. The Company continues to build the capital strength and growth capacities to execute its strategies to create superior value for shareholders.
 
OPERATIONS
 
The Company’s operating strategy is delineated by business lines and by the functional support areas that help accomplish the stated goals and financial budget of the organization. A major component of future income is growth in three core business lines – retail and small business banking, commercial and industrial banking and real estate lending. These core businesses, combined with the Company’s geographic locations, dictate the market position that the Company needs to take to be successful. The majority of new loan growth will occur in all three lines, although the retail segment primarily provides the funding through core deposit relationship growth.
Retail and Small Business Banking 
 
The Company markets to consumers in geographic areas around its branch network not only through existing bricks and mortar, but also with alternative delivery mechanisms and new product development such as online banking, remote deposit capture, mobile banking and telephonic banking. In addition, the Company attracts new customers by making its service through these distribution points convenient. All of the Company’s existing markets are prime targets for expanding the consumer side of its business with full loan and deposit relationships, and the Company has restructured its retail group to accommodate growth.

Commercial and Industrial Banking 
 
In the commercial and industrial banking group, the Company focuses on small to mid-sized business customers (sales of $5 million to $15 million each year) who are not targeted by larger banks and for whom smaller community banks have limited expertise. The Company has an experienced team with a strong loan pipeline. The typical relationship consists of working capital lines and equipment loans with the primary deposit accounts of the customer. Many of these relationships will be new to the Company and create strong and positive growth potential.
Commercial Real Estate Lending 
 
The Company has historically held a significant concentration in real estate loans. The current strategy is to manage the existing real estate portfolio and add income producing property loans and builders and other development loans to the portfolio. The Company originates both owner occupied and non-owner occupied borrowings where the cash flows provide significant debt coverage for the relationship.
COMPETITION
 
Within its market areas in Virginia and Maryland, the Company operates in a highly competitive environment, competing for deposits and loans with commercial corporations, savings banks and other financial institutions, including non-bank competitors such as financial technology companies, many of which possess substantially greater financial resources than those available to the Company. Many of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that other financial institutions, with substantially greater resources than the Company, will not establish operations in its service area. The financial services industry remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving.
 
The activities in which the Company engages are highly competitive. Financial institutions such as credit unions, consumer finance companies, financial technology companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market. Brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks. Legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition that the Company faces. Federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities, combined with tax-free status, to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business. The tax-free status granted to credit unions provides them a significant competitive advantage. Many of the largest banks operating in Virginia and Maryland, including some of the largest banks in the country, have offices in the Company’s market areas. Many of these institutions have capital resources, broader geographic markets, and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to the Company. The Company faces competition from institutions that offer products and services that it does not or cannot currently offer. Some institutions with which the Company competes offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that the Company is unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns. The Company expects the level of competition to increase.
 
Factors such as rates offered on loan and deposit products, types of products offered, and the number and location of branch offices, as well as the reputation of institutions in the market, affect competition for loans and deposits. The Company emphasizes customer service, establishing long-term relationships with its customers, thereby creating customer loyalty, and providing adequate product lines for individuals and small to medium-sized business customers.
 
The Company would not be materially or adversely impacted by the loss of a single customer. The Company is not dependent upon a single or a few customers.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 255 full-time equivalent employees, including executive officers, loan and other banking officers, branch personnel, operations personnel and other support personnel. None of the Company’s employees is represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company considers its employee relations to be excellent.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General 
 
As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Other federal and state laws govern the activities of our bank subsidiary, including the activities in which it may engage, the investments that it makes, the aggregate amount of loans that it may grant to one borrower, and the dividends it may declare and pay to us. Our bank subsidiary is also subject to various consumer and compliance laws. As a state-chartered bank, the Bank is primarily subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “SCC”). Our bank subsidiary also is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC.
 
The following description discusses certain provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions on the Company and the Bank. These federal and state laws and regulations have been enacted generally for the protection of depositors in banks and not for the protection of shareholders of bank holding companies or banks.
 
Bank Holding Companies 
 
The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the BHCA and, as a result, is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve may require. The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to it. While federal law permits bank holding companies from any state to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state, or to establish interstate de novo branches, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or nonbank acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the establishment of any interstate de novo branches, proposed by a bank holding company.
 
There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositor of such depository institutions and to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or in default. For example, under a policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or shareholders in the event that a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of the Bank.
 
The Company was required to register in Virginia with the SCC under the financial institution holding company laws of Virginia. Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the SCC.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act 
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States and has a broad impact on the financial services industry. While some rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act has occurred, many of the act’s provisions require study or rulemaking by federal agencies, a process which will take years to implement fully.
 
Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new capital standards that eliminate the treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. Existing trust preferred securities were grandfathered for banking entities with less than $15 billion of assets, such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised deposit insurance levels to $250,000. Pursuant to modifications under the Dodd-Frank Act, deposit insurance assessments are calculated based on an insured depository institution’s assets rather than its insured deposits, and the minimum reserve ratio of the FDIC’s DIF is to be raised to 1.35%. The payment of interest on business demand deposit accounts is permitted by the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act bars banking organizations, such as the Company, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain limited circumstances.

The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB has the exclusive authority to prescribe rules governing the provision of consumer financial products and services, which in the case of the Bank will be enforced by the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that debit card interchange fees must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer with respect to the transaction. This provision is known as the “Durbin Amendment.” In 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the card issuer implements certain fraud-prevention standards. The interchange fee restriction only applies to financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more and therefore has no effect on the Company.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other “covered financial institution” that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or compensation that gives rise to excessive risk or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the bank regulatory agencies promulgated the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the impact of activities to achieve incentive compensation with the related risk to the financial institution of such behaviour.
 
Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the new requirements have yet to be implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on the operations of the Company and the Bank is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may affect the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, impose more stringent capital requirements, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Company and the Bank. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
Capital Requirements
 
The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations that it supervises. Under the risk-based capital requirements, the Company and the Bank are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) of 8%. At least half of the total capital must be composed of “Tier 1 Capital,” which is defined as common equity, retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock, less certain intangibles. The remainder may consist of “Tier 2 Capital,” which is defined as specific subordinated debt, some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance. In addition, each of the federal banking regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations.
 
In 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule (the “Basel III Rule”) revising the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to be consistent with the agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems” (Basel III) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (referred to as “banking organizations”). For community banking organizations, like the Company, these revised capital requirements began being phased in beginning on January 1, 2015.
 
Under the requirements prior to effectiveness of the Basel III Rule, banking organizations must have maintained a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3% to 5%, subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization’s overall safety and soundness. In summary, the capital measures used by the federal banking regulators are:
 

· | Total risk-based capital ratio (Total Capital Ratio), which is the total of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (Tier 1 Ratio), which is Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6
-


· | Leverage Ratio, which is Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of adjusted average total assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under pre-Basel III Rule regulations, a bank was considered:
 

· | “Well capitalized” if it had a Total Capital Ratio of 10% or greater, Tier 1 Ratio of 6% or greater, a Leverage Ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive by a federal bank regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Adequately capitalized” if it had a Total Capital Ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Ratio of 4% or greater, and a Leverage Ratio of 4% or greater — or 3% in certain circumstances — and was not well capitalized;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Undercapitalized” if it had a Total Capital Ratio of less than 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Ratio of less than 4%, and a Leverage Ratio of less than 4% — or 3% in certain circumstances;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Significantly undercapitalized” if it had a Total Capital Ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 Ratio of less than 3%, or a Leverage Ratio of less than 3%; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Critically undercapitalized” if its tangible equity was equal to or less than 2% of average quarterly tangible assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Among other things, the Basel III Rule establishes a new common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum capital requirement, introduces a “capital conservation buffer” and raises minimum risk-based capital requirements. Under the new rule, CET1 is defined as comprising Tier 1 Capital, less non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and grandfathered trust-preferred and other securities, plus certain regulatory deductions. The Basel III Rule establishes a new minimum required ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets (CET1 Ratio) of 4.5%, and raises the minimum Tier 1 Ratio to 6.0% (from the prior 4.0% minimum). Furthermore, the minimum required Leverage Ratio is increased in the final Basel III Rule to 4.0% for all banking organizations irrespective of differences in composite supervisory ratings.
 
In conjunction with the changes in the required minimum capital ratios, the Basel III Rule also changes the definitions of the five regulatory capitalization categories set forth above, effective January 1, 2015. A table illustrating these changes is set forth below.
 

Capitalization Category | Total Capital Ratio (%) | Tier 1 Ratio (%) | CET1 Ratio (%) | Leverage Ratio (%)
-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+----------------+-------------------
Well capitalized (prior) | ≥ 10 | ≥ 6 | N/A | ≥ 5 
Well capitalized (Basel III) | ≥ 10 | ≥ 8 | ≥ 6.5 | ≥ 5 
Adequately capitalized (prior) | ≥ 8 | ≥ 4 | N/A | ≥ 4 
Adequately capitalized (Basel III) | ≥ 8 | ≥ 6 | ≥ 4.5 | ≥ 4 
Undercapitalized (prior) | < 8 | < 4 | N/A | < 4 
Undercapitalized (Basel III) | < 8 | < 6 | < 4.5 | < 4 
Significantly undercapitalized (prior) | < 6 | < 3 | N/A | < 3 
Significantly undercapitalized (Basel III) | < 6 | < 4 | < 3 | < 3 
Critically undercapitalized (prior) | GAAP tangible equity ≤ 2% of average quarterly assets | 
Critically undercapitalized (Basel III) | Basel III tangible equity (Tier 1 Capital plus non-tier 1 perpetual preferred stock) ≤ 2% of total assets

 
The new required capital conservation buffer is comprised of an additional 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will be subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. This capital conservation buffer is in addition to, and not included with, the minimum ratios described above. A table illustrating these limitations on the ratio which can be paid out (defined in the Basel III Rule as “maximum payout ratio”) is set forth below.
 

Capital Conservation Buffer | Maximum payout ratio (as a percentage of eligible retained income) | 
----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------
Greater than 2.5% | | No applicable limitation. | 
≤ 2.5% and > 1.875% | | 60 | %
≤ 1.875% and > 1.25% | | 40 | %
≤ 1.25% and > 0.625% | | 20 | %
≤ 0.625% | | 0 | %

The Basel III Rule also introduces new methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets, including higher risk weightings, up to a maximum of 150%, for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and for certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The Basel III Rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings to be included, or excluded, as applicable, for purposes of calculating certain regulatory capital requirements. Additionally, the Basel III Rule establishes that, for banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital would be permanently grandfathered in.
 
The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by the agency in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization’s capital adequacy.
 
The FDIC may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the FDIC. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers. The Bank presently maintains sufficient capital to remain in compliance with these capital requirements.
 
Dividends 
 
The Company’s ability to distribute cash dividends will depend primarily on the ability of its banking subsidiary to pay dividends to it. The Bank is subject to legal limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay under Section 5199(b) of the Revised Statues (12 U.S.C. 60), and the approval of the Federal Reserve would be required if the total of all dividends declared by a state member bank in any calendar year shall exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Additionally, the Bank is further restricted by Regulation H, Section 208.5, Dividends and Other Distributions, which requires pre-approval of dividends that exceed undivided profits. Furthermore, neither the Company nor the Bank may declare or pay a cash dividend on any of its capital stock if it is insolvent or if the payment of the dividend would render the entity insolvent or unable to pay its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business.
 
Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Bank’s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank.
 
Deposit Insurance 
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. As of January 1, 2015, the basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.
 
The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that changed the assessment base for DIF assessments from domestic deposits to Tier 1 Capital. In addition, as also required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2 percent for the DIF and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule, when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the institution’s assigned risk category, which is based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. Initial base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC may make the following further adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rates: decreases for long-term unsecured debt including most senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt; increases for holding long-term unsecured debt or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions; and increases for broker deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits for institutions not well rated and well capitalized.

The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by raising the designated reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. In 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
Incentive Compensation
 
In 2010, the federal banking regulators issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s Board of Directors.
 
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with the new guidance.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley) drew lines between the types of activities that are permitted for banking organizations that are financial in nature and those that are not permitted because they are commercial in nature.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley created a new form of financial organization called a financial holding company that may own and control banks, insurance companies and securities firms, thereby repealing the prohibition in the Glass-Steagall Act on bank affiliations with companies that are engaged primarily in securities underwriting activities. A financial holding company is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to an activity that is financial in nature or is a complementary activity, including, for example, insurance, securities transactions (including underwriting, broker/dealer activities and investment advisory services) and traditional banking-related activities. The Company is currently not a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach-Bliley.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley directed federal banking regulators to adopt rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. Pursuant to these rules, financial institutions must provide: initial notices to customers about their privacy policies, including a description of the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates; annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers; and a reasonable method for customers to “opt out” of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties. These privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to these rules.
 
Community Reinvestment Act 
 
Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and related regulations, depository institutions have an affirmative obligation to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practice. CRA requires the adoption of a statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution’s efforts to assist in its community’s credit needs. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with CRA and are periodically assigned ratings in this regard. Banking regulators consider a depository institution’s CRA rating when reviewing applications to establish new branches, undertake new lines of business, and/or acquire part or all of another depository institution. An unsatisfactory rating can significantly delay or even prohibit regulatory approval of a proposed transaction by a bank holding company or its depository institution subsidiaries.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley and federal bank regulators have made various changes to CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A financial holding company or any of its subsidiaries will not be permitted to engage in new activities authorized under Gramm-Leach-Bliley if any bank subsidiary received less than a “satisfactory” rating in its latest CRA examination. The Company believes that it is currently in compliance with CRA.
 
Fair Lending; Consumer Laws 
 
In addition to CRA, other federal and state laws regulate various lending and consumer aspects of the banking business. Governmental agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, have become concerned that prospective borrowers experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain loans from depository and other lending institutions. These agencies have brought litigation against depository institutions alleging discrimination against borrowers. Many of these suits have been settled, in some cases for material sums, short of a full trial.
 
These governmental agencies have clarified what they consider to be lending discrimination and have specified various factors that they will use to determine the existence of lending discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, including evidence that a lender discriminated on a prohibited basis, evidence that a lender treated applicants differently based on prohibited factors in the absence of evidence that the treatment was the result of prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate, and evidence that a lender applied an otherwise neutral non-discriminatory policy uniformly to all applicants, but the practice had a discriminatory effect, unless the practice could be justified as a business necessity.
 
Banks and other depository institutions also are subject to numerous consumer-oriented laws and regulations. These laws, which include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Housing Act, require compliance by depository institutions with various disclosure requirements and requirements regulating the availability of funds after deposit or the making of some loans to customers.
 
Governmental Policies 
 
The Federal Reserve regulates money, credit and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits. These policies also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
Future Regulations
 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Bank.
