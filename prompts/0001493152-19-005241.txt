ITEM 1. Business
The Company
 
1. Organizational History
 
The Company took its present corporate form in March 2004 when shareholders of Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Ltd. (“Kiwa BVI”), a company originally organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on June 5, 2002 and Tintic Gold Mining Company (“Tintic”), a corporation originally incorporated in the state of Utah on June 14, 1933 to perform mining operations in Utah, entered into a share exchange transaction. The share exchange transaction left the shareholders of Kiwa BVI owning a majority of Tintic and Kiwa BVI a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tintic. For accounting purposes this transaction was treated as an acquisition of Tintic by Kiwa BVI in the form of a reverse triangular merger and a recapitalization of Kiwa BVI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Kiwa Bio-Tech Products (Shandong) Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Shandong”). On July 21, 2004, we completed our reincorporation in the State of Delaware. On March 8, 2017, we completed our reincorporation in the State of Nevada.
The Company currently mainly operates its business through Kiwa Baiao Bio-Tech (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Beijing”), which was incorporated in China in January 2016, Kiwa Bio-Tech Products (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Shenzhen”), which was incorporated in China in November 2016, Kiwa Bio-Tech Products (Hebei) Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Hebei”), which was incorporated in China in December 2016, Kiwa Bio-Tech Products (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. Xian Branch Company, (“Kiwa Xian”), which was incorporated in China in December 2017, Kiwa Bio-Tech (Yangling) Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Yangling”), which incorporated in March 2018, and The Institute of Kiwa-Yangling Ecological Agriculture and Environment Research Co., Ltd. (“Kiwa Institute”), which incorporated in March 2018. In July 2017, the Company established Kiwa Bio-Tech Asia Holding (Shenzhen) Ltd. (“Kiwa Asia”) to be the direct holding company of Kiwa Beijing, Kiwa Shenzhen, Kiwa Xian, Kiwa Institue and Kiwa Hebei.
 
The Company’s Research and Development department has been conducting application experiments in Hainan and Hunan Provinces since August 2015, in accordance with the market requirements. The experiment data indicates that the Company’s fertilizer products have fulfilled the requirements of reduction of content of heavy metals in soil and improved crop yield. On December 17, 2015, we awarded Kangtan Gerui (Beijing) Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. (“Gerui”), a related party of the Company who was founded in Beijing in April 2015 and has fertilizer sales permit in China, the right to sell and distribute the Company’s fertilizer products in 3 major agricultural regions of China— Hainan Province, Hunan Province and Xinjiang Autonomous Region for a period of three years commencing December 17, 2015. In September 2016, Kiwa Beijing obtained a fertilizer sales permit from the Chinese government and began to sale the products directly to customers in those 3 major agricultural regions.

On October 12, 2018, the Company got the approval from the Administrative Committee of Yangling Agricultural High-tech Industry Demonstration Zone to obtain land to construct a new manufacturing facility to help meet the growing demand in China for bio-fertilizers. Yangling Free Trade Zone has agreed to offer the Company approximately US$432,975 (RMB 3,000,000) in incentives and provide tax preferences for the first three years of production. The manufacturing facility will specialize in developing and producing Kiwa Bio-Tech’s core microbes, the fundamental components for making high-quality bio-fertilizers. The total facility construction area is approximately 8.77 acres, and will include fermentation and production terminals, agricultural produce sorting facilities and storage, a research and development institute and corresponding ancillary facilities. The construction of the manufacturing facility is expected to be completed in 2020 and have a production capacity of 60,000 tons of Kiwa Bio-Tech’s core microbes. The annual production value is expected to be over US$65 million (approximately 462 million RMB).
 
The company plans to restructure its operations in China to relocate its activities previously located in Shenzhen and Beijing to Yangling and focus its research and development, and strains fermentation activities in the Yangling Free Trade Zone. The Company will streamline its corporate structure in China to conduct its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kiwa Yangling, and will divest its interest in Kiwa Asia and all of its subsidiaries except for Kiwa Hebei and the Kiwa-Yangling Institute. Kiwa Hebei and Kiwa Institute will become subsidiaries of Kiwa Yangling. The Company expects to complete this restructuring and divestiture in early 2019, and plans to build four fertilizer production bases in China’s major agricultural regions in the next five years.
 

2. Overview of Business

Our Products
 
We have developed three bio-fertilizer products with bacillus species (“bacillus spp”) and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we are currently generating revenues from our four bio-fertilizer products: 1) Biological Organic Fertilizer; 2) Compound Microbial Fertilizer; 3) Bio-Water Soluble Fertilizer; 4) Microbial Inoculum Fertilizer.
 
Some of our products contain ingredients of both photosynthesis and bacillus bacteria. Bacillus spp is a species of bacteria that interacts with plants and promotes biological processes. It is highly effective for promoting plant growth, enhancing yield, improving quality and elevating resistances. Photosynthetic bacteria are a group of green and purple bacteria. Bacterial photosynthesis differs from green plant photosynthesis in that bacterial photosynthesis occurs in an anaerobic environment and does not produce oxygen. Photosynthetic bacteria can enhance the photosynthetic capacity of green plants by increasing the utilization of sunlight, which helps keep the photosynthetic process at a vigorous level, enhances the capacity of plants to transform inorganic materials to organic products, and boosts overall plant health and productivity.
 
Biological Fertilizer provide beneficial living microorganisms and micronutrition to soil and improve plants absorptivity of main growth ingredients. Proper use could prevent soil-borne, crops disease, improve soil fertility, alleviate agricultural pollution and degrade heavy metal in farmland soil.
 
Compound Microbial Fertilizer is adding appropriate amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients into Biological Organic Fertilizer. Through the action of organic matter and beneficial microorganisms, the utilization rate of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium can be significantly improved.
 
The Bio-Water Soluble Fertilizer is mainly another form of the biological fertilizer that we firstly introduced in the first quarter of 2018. It is in the form of powder which has high water solubility, and it is convenient for the farmers to use during the drop irrigation.
 
Microbial Inoculum Fertilizer is an environment-friendly biological soil conditioner that made of compound high-silicon, calcium, and mineral raw materials, on the basis of dissolving-phosphorus, dissolving-potassium, and disease-resistant microbial agents. It is rich in highly active microorganisms, which can improve the micro-ecological environment in the soil, transform and reduce heavy metal toxicity, release the plant growth stimulants, promote crop growth, and enhance the stress resistance.
 
Compound Microbial Fertilizer, Bio-Water Soluble Fertilizer, and Microbial Inoculum Fertilizer generally contain more microorganism and have a higher effectiveness on the productivity of crops and increasing the value and quality of the crops harvested than Biological Organic Fertilizer. As a result, our Compound Microbial Fertilizer, Bio-Water Soluble Fertilizer, and Microbial Inoculum Fertilizer generally have a higher average selling price as compared to Biological Organic Fertilizer.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our bacillus bacteria based fertilizers are protected by patents. In 2004, we acquired patent no. ZL 93101635.5 entitled “Highly Effective Composite Bacteria for Enhancing Yield and the Related Methodology for Manufacturing” from China Agricultural University (“CAU”) for the aggregate purchase of $480,411, consisting of $60,411 in cash and 5,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $84.00 per share (aggregate value of $420,000). Our photosynthetic bacteria based fertilizers are also protected by trade secret laws.
 
The patent acquired from CAU covers six different species of bacillus which have been tested as bio-fertilizers to enhance yield and plant health. The production methods of the six species are also patented. The patent has expired on February 19, 2013.There are no limitations under this agreement on our exclusive use of the patent. Pursuant to our agreement with CAU, the University agreed to provide research and technology support services at no additional cost to us in the event we decide to use the patent to produce commercial products. These research and technology support services include: (1) furnishing faculty or graduate-level researchers to help bacteria culturing, sampling, testing, trial production and production formula adjustment; (2) providing production technology and procedures to turn the products into powder form while keeping live required bacteria in the products; (3) establishing quality standards and quality control systems; (4) providing testing and research support for us to obtain necessary sale permits from the Chinese government; and (5) cooperation in developing derivative products.

On January 5, 2011, the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC (“Intellectual Property Office”) granted Kiwa two Certificates of Patent of Invention for (1) “A cucumber dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their specific strains with related application” with patent number of “ZL 2008 1 0144492.6”; and (2) “Cotton dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their special strains with related application” with patent number of “ZL 2008 1 0144491.1” These two patents have been developed by Kiwa-CAU R&D Center. These two patents will expire on August 5, 2028. These two patents can be used to develop specific environment-friendly bio-fertilizer.
 
We have obtained three fertilizer registration certificates from the Chinese government - two covering our bacillus bacteria fertilizer and one covering our photosynthetic bacteria fertilizer. The five registration certificates are: (1) Biological Organic Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (2) Compound Microbial Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (3) Compound Microbial Water Soluble Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture. Protected by these three fertilizer registration certificates and five trademarks under the names of “KANGTAN” (Chinese translation name for Kiwa), “ZHIGUANGYOU,” “PUGUANGFU,” “JINWA” and “KANGGUAN,” we have developed three series of bio-fertilizer products with bacillus spp and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. Valid period of fertilizer registration certificates is five years and may be extended for another five years upon application from the owner of fertilizer registration certificates. The Company has determined to re-apply the Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture.

Our Competition
 
We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Some of our competitors have achieved greater market penetration but with less sophisticated technological innovation than our products as they were in the transition period from being the chemical bio-fertilizer producers to the organically bio-fertilizer producers. We believe that we have a better competitive advantage over them as we are the pioneer within our markets. Some of our competitors competed within our markets have lesser financial and other resources than us as they have established their companies a few years behind us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.
Our main competitors include China Green Agriculture, Inc., Genliduo Biotechnology Ltd., Shenzhen Baitan Ecotypic Engineering Co. Ltd., Hunan Taigu Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Shanxi A.K. Quantum Agricultural Technology Corporation.
 
Research and Development
 
In July 2006, we established a new research center with China Agricultural University (“CAU”) which is known as Kiwa-CAU Bio-Tech Research & Development Center (the “Kiwa-CAU R&D Center”). Pursuant to an agreement between CAU and Kiwa Shandong dated November 14, 2006, Kiwa agreed to contribute RMB 1 million (approximately $160,000) each year to fund research at Kiwa-CAU R&D Center. The term of this agreement was ten years starting from July 1, 2006. Prof. Qi Wang, who became one of our directors in July 2007, has acted as the Director of Kiwa-CAU R&D Center since July 2006. Under the above agreement, the Kiwa-CAU R&D Center is responsible for fulfilling the overall research-and-development functions of Kiwa Shandong, including: (1) development of new technologies and new products (which will be shared by Kiwa and CAU); (2) subsequent perfection of existing product-related technologies; and (3) training quality-control personnel and technicians and technical support for marketing activities.
 
During fiscal 2014, Kiwa-CAU R&D Center had successfully isolated several strains of endophytic bacillus from plants. A number of strains had been observed to have the capability of boosting crop yield and dispelling chemical pesticide residual from soil. These strains could be used for developing not only new biological preparation but also environmental protection preparation. The Company terminated its cooperation with CAU when the agreement expired on July 1, 2016. All the liabilities owed to Kiwa-CAU R&D Center were assumed by the Transferee of Kiwa Shandong when the Company disposed Kiwa Shandong on Feb 11, 2017.
 
On November 5, 2015, the Company signed a strategic cooperation agreement (the “Agreement”) with China Academy of Agricultural Science (“CAAS”)’s Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning (“IARRP”) and Institute of Agricultural Economy & Development (“IAED”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will form a strategic partnership with the two institutes and establish an “International Cooperation Platform for Internet and Safe Agricultural Products”. To fund the cooperation platform’s R&D activities, the Company will provide RMB 1 million (approximately $160,000) per year to the Spatial Agriculture Planning Method & Applications Innovation Team that belongs to the Institute. The term of the Agreement is for three years beginning November 20, 2015. However, the Company is only liable for the annual funds to be provided to the extent of the contract obligations performed by CAAS IARRP and IAED, and the agreement is terminable before the three years’ commitment date based on negotiations of both parties. Prof. Yong Chang Wu, the authorized representative of IARRP, CAAS, is also one of the Company’s directors effective since November 20, 2015 until March 13, 2017.
 
In March 2018, Kiwa Bio-Tech has established a Research Institute of Ecological Agriculture and Environmental Research. Based on cooperation with various Universities including the China Agriculture University, Northwest University, Northwest A&F University, Harbin Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University, we believe that it can secure a leading position in the KETS technology in the next thirty years. In comparison to our existing technology, Ecology Technological Sustainability (“KETS”) technology is comprised of microorganisms with a larger scale of micro-flora. The micro-flora could significantly increase the beneficial microorganism in the soil that enhances the yield of the plant crops and prevents soil ecological problems. The newly upgraded technology will be applied to the main crop planting areas and presently-polluted arable areas for soil restoration.

Other
 
On February 27, 2017, the Company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Beijing Zhongpin Agricultural Science and Technology Development Center (“Zhongpin Center”). Zhongpin Center is the Chinese Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation and Development Committee’s executive implementation agency (referred to as the Agricultural Science and Technology Commission). The Agricultural Science and Technology Commission is set up by the Chinese Central Government for the construction of the National Ecological Security Agriculture Industrial Chain standardization system. This includes the establishment of National Ecology Safe Agricultural Industrial Parks to build China’s Ecological Security and Agricultural Industrial in an orderly business environment, including completion of the National Soil Remediation Program and governance of the various government functions of the institutions. Through the guidance and support by the Zhongpin Center, Kiwa will participate and be involved in China’s National Soil Remediation Program and construction of the National Ecological Security Agriculture Industrial Chain Standardization System’s operation and process.
 
On April 2, 2018, the company had terminated its cooperation agreement with ETS Biological Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (“ETS”) and, in its place, has developed “Ecology Technological Sustainability” (“KETS”) as its core technology to upgrade its microbial fertilizer products. In February 2017, the Company had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with ETS and planned to build new product categories based on the cooperative research results. Following the research, the two parties did not reach a further agreement and determined to terminate the partnership. As a result, the Company switched its focus to the KETS technology to fulfill its needs in connection with fertilizer production. As a part of this process, Kiwa Bio-Tech has established a Research Institute of Ecological Agriculture and Environmental Research. Based on cooperation with various Universities including the China Agriculture University, Northwest University, Northwest A&F University, Harbin Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University, the Company believes that it can secure a leading position in the KETS technology in the next thirty years. In comparison to the Company’s existing technology, KETS technology is comprised of microorganisms with a larger scale of micro-flora. The micro-flora could significantly increase the beneficial bacteria in the soil that enhances the yield of the plant crops and prevents soil ecological problems. The newly upgraded technology will be applied to the main crop planting areas and presently-polluted arable areas for soil restoration.
