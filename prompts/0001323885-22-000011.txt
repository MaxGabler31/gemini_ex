ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading innovator in treatments for atrial fibrillation (Afib), left atrial appendage (LAA) management and post-operative pain. According to the American Heart Association, Afib affects 1-2% of the population in the United States. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, encountered in clinical practice and results in high utilization of healthcare services by Afib patients. Symptoms of Afib may include heart palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath, and these symptoms may be debilitating and life threatening in some cases. When a patient is in Afib, abnormal electrical impulses cause the atria, or upper chambers of the heart, to fibrillate, or beat rapidly, irregularly and in an uncoordinated fashion. As a result, blood in the atria may be in stasis, increasing the risk that a blood clot will form and cause a stroke or other serious complications. In patients with Afib, a significant percentage of those clots can form inside of the LAA. Patients often progress from being in Afib intermittently (paroxysmal) to being in Afib continuously. The continuous Afib patient population includes persistent Afib, which lasts seven days to one year, and long-standing persistent Afib, which lasts longer than one year. Afib often occurs in conjunction with other cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery disease and valvular disease.
Our ablation and left atrial appendage management (LAAM) products are used by physicians during both open-heart and minimally invasive procedures. In open-heart procedures, the physician is performing heart surgery for other conditions, and our products are used in conjunction with (“concomitant” to) such a procedure. Minimally invasive procedures are performed on a standalone basis, and often include multi-disciplinary or “hybrid” approaches, combining both surgical procedures using AtriCure ablation and LAAM products and catheter ablation.
Recovery from cardiothoracic and thoracic surgery can be complicated and painful. Many surgeons use multi-modal pain management strategies that include global and local pain management techniques or oral delivery of opioid and non-opioid pain medications. In an effort to improve patient recovery for those undergoing Afib surgery, we pursued an analgesia indication for our cryo ablation devices in 2015. Upon seeing the impact on patients and potential applications in a wide variety of surgical procedures, we developed our cryoICE cryoSPHERE® probe for pain management (Cryo Nerve Block). Our pain management solutions are used by physicians to freeze nerves during cardiothoracic or thoracic surgical procedures. This technique provides a long-lasting analgesic, allowing the patient's body to heal after surgery while the nerves regenerate and sensation is regained. 
We believe that we are currently the market leader in the surgical treatment of Afib. Our Isolator® Synergy™ Ablation System is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib concomitant to other open-heart surgical procedures. The EPi-Sense® system is approved by FDA to treat patients with long-standing persistent Afib. All of our other ablation devices are cleared for sale in the United States under FDA 510(k) clearances, including our other radio frequency (RF) and cryoablation products, which are indicated for the ablation of cardiac tissue and/or the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, certain of our cryoablation probes are cleared for managing pain by temporarily ablating peripheral nerves, or Cryo Nerve Block therapy. Further, certain cryoablation probes are approved for the ablation of the intercostal nerves to temporarily block pain in adolescents aged 12 or older. Our AtriClip® LAA Exclusion System products are 510(k)-cleared with an indication for the exclusion of the LAA, performed under direct visualization and in conjunction with other cardiac surgical procedures. Direct visualization, in this context, requires that the surgeon is able to see the heart directly, with or without assistance from a camera, endoscope or other appropriate viewing technologies. In July 2021, we received 510(k) clearance for the new ENCOMPASS® clamp to ablate cardiac tissue during surgery. The LARIAT® system is cleared under the 510(k) process for soft tissue ligation. Several of our products are currently being studied to expand labeling claims or to support indications specifically for the treatment of Afib. Our Isolator Synergy clamps, Isolator Synergy pens, Coolrail® linear pen, cryoablation devices, cryoSPHERE® probe, certain products of the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System, COBRA Fusion® Ablation System, the EPi-Sense® system and LARIAT Suture Delivery Device bear the CE mark and may be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union and other countries that comply with or mirror the Medical Device Directive. Our Isolator Synergy clamps, Isolator Synergy pens, Coolrail linear pen, cryoablation devices and certain products of the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System are available in select Asia-Pacific countries. We anticipate that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will relate to products we currently sell or are in the process of developing.

Market Overview 
Afib is the most commonly diagnosed sustained cardiac arrhythmia with approximately 1.2 million diagnoses annually in the United States, and affects approximately 33 million people worldwide. It is estimated that the incidence of Afib doubles with each decade of an adult’s life. At age 40, remaining lifetime risk for Afib is 26% for men and 23% for women. Afib is an under-diagnosed condition due in large part to the fact that patients with Afib often have mild or no symptoms, and their Afib is often only diagnosed when they seek treatment for an associated condition, such as a structural heart disease or stroke. We believe that increasing awareness of Afib and improved diagnostic screening will result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with Afib over time. Also, since the prevalence of Afib increases with age, there will likely be an increase in the number of diagnosed Afib patients in the United States as the population ages. We believe that these trends in the United States also apply globally.
Afib is a condition that doctors often find difficult to treat and, historically, there has been no widely accepted long-term cure for Afib. This difficulty is exacerbated with more serious forms of Afib, or persistent and long-standing persistent Afib. Over the past two decades, technology advancements have made surgical ablation more effective, repeatable and available to cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists around the world. Societal guideline changes from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and American Association of Thoracic Surgery (AATS) now have Class I recommendations for surgical ablation, meaning that it is a “recommended” treatment, no longer just “reasonable”, for patients who have structural heart disease and Afib. In addition, guidelines for the treatment of more serious forms of Afib for patients without structural heart disease have also been introduced in the past several years. These societal guidelines are reflective of the scientific evidence suggesting that surgical and hybrid ablation is safe and effective for patients who have Afib.
Of the patients undergoing open-heart surgery globally on an annual basis, we estimate that over 250,000 are potential candidates for surgical ablation using our products. Today, we estimate that approximately 25% to 35% of those candidates are being treated, but we believe many are not treated properly or fully. Of the population diagnosed with Afib, a large percentage of patients are symptomatic and do not respond to pharmacological therapy. 
In addition, Afib is thought to be responsible for approximately 15% to 20% of the estimated 800,000 strokes that occur annually in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, the risk of stroke is five times higher in people with Afib. Studies have also suggested that 90% of clots that cause strokes in patients who have Afib originate from within the LAA. Recently, a very large independent international randomized trial, Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS) III, demonstrated a significant reduction in strokes when the LAA was managed during cardiac surgery. Afib accounts for billions of dollars in hospitalization-related and office visit costs in the United States each year. Indirect costs, such as the management of Afib-related strokes, are believed to be significant. Because of the risk of stroke and the significant cost burden on the healthcare system, more and more surgeons are routinely addressing the LAA, both in patients who have Afib, but also in those who do not have Afib but may be at increased risk of developing the disease in the future. We believe that our AtriClip system is safer, more effective and easier to use than other products and techniques for excluding the LAA during cardiac surgery. Therefore, we believe that the market for the AtriClip system represents a significant growth opportunity.
Many Afib patients seek relief solely from the symptoms of their Afib, including palpitations, breathlessness and drowsiness, without underlying structural heart disease. These patients are typically treated by an electrophysiologist using catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is considered a percutaneous procedure that does not require the opening of the chest and involves catheters inserted through a small puncture in the groin. It is estimated that after failing pharmacological therapy, 150,000 - 200,000 Afib patients are treated by catheter ablation every year in the U.S., a number that is expected to grow 10-15% annually. While the majority of paroxysmal Afib patients treated by catheter ablation tend to experience freedom from Afib, less than a third of long-standing persistent Afib patients treated by catheter ablation become free of Afib. Recent randomized, prospective, multi-center data shows that these long-standing persistent Afib patients can experience double the success rate by adding an ablation on the outside surface of the heart using AtriCure’s EPi-Sense ablation system. Thus, we believe the EPi-Sense ablation system used as a minimally invasive or Hybrid AFTM therapy represents a significant growth opportunity for the Company.

Additionally, cardiothoracic and thoracic surgery involving an incision through the ribcage, typically referred to as thoracotomy access, can often times result in significant post-operative pain and longer hospital recovery times as patients refrain from mobilizing their chest near the incision site. Most surgeons will employ a multi-modal pain management protocol that includes global and local pain management techniques, including epidural delivery of medication directly around the spinal cord, intravenous or oral delivery of opioid and non-opioid pain medications. More focused, local techniques include syringe injections between vertebrates and Cryo Nerve Block, the use of cryo-energy to temporarily ablate peripheral nerves. Cryo Nerve Block can be delivered using our cryoICE cryoSPHERE® probe, which is specifically designed for Cryo Nerve Block, as well as our cryoICE CRYO2 probe, one of the same probes used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Depending on the degree of invasiveness, physicians and their nursing staff will take advantage of multiple modes of pain management. It is estimated that each year roughly 140,000 cardiac and thoracic procedures are performed in the United States through thoracotomy access. Hospital recovery times can vary from two to eight days depending on the procedure, operative complications associated with the procedure, pain management protocol and other factors. In recent years, opioids have come under heavy scrutiny due to their potential for long-term dependency, overdose and possible death. The Center for Disease Control has reported over 49,000 deaths involving opioids in the United States in a single year, and both federal and local governments in the United States have proposed and implemented new regulations to curb the opioid overdose epidemic. It is also estimated that one in seven cardiothoracic surgical patients develops an unhealthy post-procedural addiction to prescription narcotics, making alternative, non-opioid pain management modalities, such as Cryo Nerve Block, increasingly important.
AtriCure Solutions and Products
Our products enable cardiothoracic surgeons to mimic all or portions of the cut and sew Maze procedure with faster, less invasive and less technically challenging approaches. We have completed, and continue to invest in, clinical studies for the use of our ablation and left atrial appendage management products to treat Afib. Leading cardiothoracic surgeons and electrophysiologists, including those who serve or who have served as consultants to us, have published results of preclinical and clinical studies utilizing our devices. The results of these studies have assessed efficacy, ease of use and safety endpoints.
Products for cardiac tissue ablation include those that heat tissue using radio frequency (RF) energy to create the tissue effects or those that cool tissue using cryo-thermal heat transfer to create the tissue effects. Our ablation products are part of platforms each consisting of disposable hand pieces which connect to compact RF power generation sources or the cryoICE BOX generator. We generally place this equipment with our direct customers and sell to our distributors.
Products for open and minimally invasive ablation:
•Isolator Synergy Clamps. Our Isolator Synergy System historically represented our primary product line and currently generates the majority of our ablation-related revenue. All of our clamps are single-use disposable RF products with jaws that close in a parallel fashion. We sell multiple configurations of our Isolator Synergy clamps with the primary difference being the form of the clamping jaws. The parallel closure compresses tissue and evacuates the blood and fluids from the energy pathway in order to make the ablation more effective. The Isolator Synergy System is currently being evaluated under the DEEP AF IDE pivotal trial and was previously studied under the ABLATE clinical trial supporting a pre-market approval (PMA) in 2011.
•Multifunctional Pens and Linear Ablation Devices. These devices are single-use disposable RF products that come in multiple configurations which have different contact lengths. The MAX Pen devices enable surgeons to evaluate cardiac arrhythmias, perform temporary cardiac pacing, sensing and stimulation and ablate cardiac tissue with the same device. Surgeons are able to readily toggle back and forth between these functions. The Coolrail device enables the user to make longer linear lines of ablation. Surgeons generally use one or more of our pen and linear devices in combination with Isolator Synergy clamps.
Products for open ablation:
•cryoICE Cryoablation System. The cryoICE cryoablation system is used in open ablation procedures and consists of the cryoICE BOX generator along with a single-use disposable probe. The primary differences between these cryoablation probes is the form of the distal end. The cryoICE devices enables the user to make linear ablations of varied lengths. Surgeons may utilize the cryoICE devices in combination with Isolator Synergy clamps or independently. The ICE-AFIB clinical trial is studying the safety and efficacy 
Table of Contents

of the cryoICE system for persistent and long-standing persistent Afib treatment during concomitant on-pump cardiac surgery. The cryoSPHERE probe and certain cryoICE devices are used to apply cryo-energy to targeted intercostal peripheral nerves in the ribcage in order to provide temporary pain relief. This technique, called Cryo Nerve Block, is applied intraoperatively by cardiothoracic or thoracic surgeons and results in temporary pain relief for up to 90 days after the procedure. Sensation typically returns to the affected region of the chest after this period. Studies are ongoing to characterize the effects of Cryo Nerve Block and further refine the procedure. 
Products for minimally invasive ablation:
•EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax Technology. The EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology utilizes monopolar RF energy for the coagulation of tissue. The EPi-Sense device is a single-use disposable which is also capable of intraoperative cardiac signal sensing and recording when connected to an external recording device. In April 2021, we announced the PMA approval of the EPi-Sense System for treatment of symptomatic, drug-refractory, long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, when augmented with an endocardial ablation catheter. The Convergent procedure, or Hybrid AF Therapy, is the only FDA-approved minimally invasive procedure to treat patients with long-standing persistent Afib. 
Products for appendage management:
•AtriClip System. The AtriClip System includes an implantable device (AtriClip) coupled to a single-use disposable applier. The AtriClip is designed to exclude the left atrial appendage by mechanically clamping the appendage from the outside of the heart, eliminating blood flow between the left atrial appendage and the atrium while avoiding contact with circulating blood. We believe that the AtriClip system is potentially safer, more effective and easier to use than other available products and techniques for permanently excluding the left atrial appendage. These benefits compared to other techniques include permanent exclusion and electrical isolation of the appendage. The AtriClip device comes in a variety of lengths allowing the user to select a configuration specific to the patient and in two geometries (a rectangular configuration which encircles the targeted tissue and “V” shape which allows lateral access for improved usability). The appliers come in multiple forms tailored to specific procedural needs and with different deployment mechanisms. The AtriClip System includes various combinations of AtriClips and appliers.
•LARIAT System. The LARIAT System is a suture-based solution for soft-tissue closure and is compatible with a wide range of anatomical shapes. The LARIAT System includes a suture loop coupled to a single-use disposable applier. The loop is designed to exclude the left atrial appendage by mechanically cinching the appendage from the outside of the heart, eliminating blood flow between the left atrial appendage and the atrium while avoiding contact with circulating blood. The LARIAT System is currently being evaluated under the aMAZE™ IDE clinical trial. 
In addition to the above product lines we also sell enabling technologies including our Lumitip™ dissectors, Glidepath™ guides for placement of our clamps, Subtle™ Cannula’s to support access for our EPi-Sense catheters and a line of reusable cardiac surgery (valve) instruments. The Lumitip dissector is used by surgeons to separate tissues to provide access to key anatomical structures that are targeted for ablation. Cardiac surgery instruments are used during certain surgical procedures for repair or replacement of heart valves.
Current Afib Treatment Alternatives
Physicians usually begin treating Afib patients with a variety of drugs intended to prevent blood clots, control heart rate or restore the heart to normal sinus rhythm. If a patient’s Afib cannot be adequately controlled with drug therapy, doctors may perform one of several open-heart or minimally-invasive procedures that vary depending on the severity of the Afib symptoms and whether or not the patient suffers from other forms of heart disease. Often, Afib procedures are performed concomitantly with other cardiac treatments. 
Table of Contents

Alternative treatments to open-heart and minimally invasive procedures include:
•Drug Therapy. Pharmaceutical options called anti-arrhythmics are available to treat Afib. Depending on a patient’s severity of the disease and heart condition, physicians typically administer these medications in a hospital setting with continuous monitoring. If the patient goes back into a normal rhythm, the physician will often prescribe a similar anti-arrhythmic drug to try to prevent a recurrence of Afib. The effectiveness of drug therapy varies based on the patient population and the drug being prescribed, among other factors. Often, pharmaceuticals to thin the blood (anti-coagulants) are prescribed due to the increased risk of stroke for patients who also have Afib.
•Implantable Devices. Implantable devices, such as defibrillators and pacemakers, can be effective in reducing the symptoms of Afib episodes, but neither device is intended to treat Afib. Patients may continue to experience the adverse effects of Afib as well as some of the symptoms and complications, including dizziness, fatigue, palpitations and stroke because the Afib continues.
•Catheter Ablation. Catheter ablation is a procedure that is typically performed by an electrophysiologist. The ablations are made from the inside of the heart using a flexible catheter. The heart is reached via a blood vessel, most commonly through the femoral vein. In proportion to the prevalence of Afib, less than 6% of patients receive catheter-based Afib treatments each year in the United States. The rate of treatment is even lower for long-standing persistent patients in which less than 1% receive catheter-based Afib treatments.
We do not promote our products specifically for Afib treatment in the United States, except for the Isolator Synergy System and the EPi-Sense System. The Isolator Synergy System may be promoted according to its FDA-approved indication for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent Afib undergoing certain open concomitant procedures, and the EPi-Sense System may be promoted according to its FDA-approved indication to treat patients with long-standing persistent Afib. During elective open-heart surgical procedures, such as bypass or valve surgery, cardiothoracic surgeons use our ablation systems to treat patients with a pre-existing history of Afib. Surgeons use our products to perform cardiac procedures that may vary depending on the length of time a patient has been diagnosed with Afib and whether the patient’s Afib is intermittent (paroxysmal), or continuous (non-paroxysmal), which is typically further classified as persistent or long-standing persistent. Patients who have been diagnosed with Afib for a longer duration and have persistent or long-standing persistent forms of Afib generally receive more extensive ablation procedures than patients who have been diagnosed with Afib for a shorter duration or who have paroxysmal Afib. Additionally, during an open-concomitant procedure, physicians may use our AtriClip system to exclude the LAA. 
For those patients with Afib who do not require an open-concomitant surgical procedure, surgeons have used our products for minimally invasive or hybrid Afib treatment procedures. These procedures have generally been performed through small incisions without the need to place patients on a heart-lung bypass machine. Additionally, during a minimally invasive surgical procedure, physicians may use our AtriClip system to exclude the LAA.
Certain physicians are combining various minimally invasive stand-alone epicardial ablation procedures (surgical ablation on the outside of the heart) with endocardial ablation and mapping techniques (catheter ablation from the inside of the heart). The combination of procedures are often referred to as “hybrid” or “multi-disciplinary” approaches, in that both surgical ablation and catheter ablations are performed. Sometimes, both procedures are performed on the same day or in the same hospital stay, where other times they are performed weeks or months apart. Patient health condition, physician preference, hospital logistics and procedural room availability influence the decision whether to perform hybrid ablations in a single or a staged setting. Physicians are reporting that they are performing these procedures utilizing certain of our products to primarily treat patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of Afib. The success of the hybrid procedure for long-standing persistent Afib patients was established with the results of the CONVERGE clinical study, the first trial of its kind for the sickest, most difficult to treat patients. We believe that the potential for hybrid Afib procedure adoption is our largest market opportunity. 
Business Strategy
We are passionately focused on reducing the global Afib epidemic and healing the lives of those affected. Our strategy is to expand the treatment options for patients who suffer from Afib or have a high risk of stroke, or who suffer 
Table of Contents

from post-operative pain through the continued development of our technologies and expansion of our product offerings, global commercial expansion and clinical science investments. The key elements of our strategy include:
New Product Innovation. Our product development pipeline includes projects which extend and improve our existing products, as well as research and development projects for new technologies. We plan to continue to develop new and innovative products, including those that allow us to enter new market opportunities or expand our growth in existing markets.
Invest in Clinical Science. We continue to invest in landmark clinical trials to validate the long-term results of procedures using our products and to support applications to regulatory agencies for expanded indications. We also make clinical research grants to support our product development efforts and expand the body of clinical evidence.
Build Physician and Societal Relationships. We have formed consulting relationships with cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists, electrophysiologists and thoracic surgeons who work with us to develop and evaluate our products. Additionally, we have formed advisory boards made up of key opinion leaders in multiple specialties to oversee our training and clinical programs. We are building these relationships to provide insight regarding treatment trends, input on future product direction and education for providers involved in treating the disease.
We are partnering with leading surgical and cardiology societies to increase the awareness of Afib treatment options. In the past four years, both the Society for Thoracic Surgeons and the Heart Rhythm Society have released new guidelines on the surgical treatment of Afib in both open-heart and minimally-invasive settings.
Provide Training and Education. We have recruited and trained sales and physician education professionals to effectively communicate to our customers the unique features and benefits of our technologies as they relate to their indications for use. Our highly trained professionals meet with physicians at institutions around the world to provide education and technical training on the features, benefits and safe-and-effective use of our products. With the approval of our Isolator Synergy System, we instituted a program to train providers on the use of the Isolator Synergy System to treat persistent and long-standing persistent Afib in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. More recently, with the approval of the EPi-Sense System, we began programs to train physicians on the use of the EPi-Sense Hybrid Coagulation system in a hybrid approach to treating patients with long-standing persistent Afib. We believe these training and education programs have increased awareness about the surgical treatment of Afib, and we will continue to make investments to serve our physician customers. As a result of the educational process, we believe that awareness of our technologies is growing and will result in the increased use of our products. 
Expand Adoption of Our Minimally Invasive Products. We believe that the catalysts for expanded adoption of our minimally invasive products include procedural advancements, such as the hybrid or multi-disciplinary procedure, continued innovation and product development and the publication of additional scientific evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of hybrid treatments for persistent and long-standing persistent Afib. We believe these efforts will help validate the successful, long-term use of our products for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent Afib. We believe that ongoing research activities, including prospective clinical trials, new procedural techniques and anticipated presentations and publications will create an increased demand for our minimally invasive products. 
Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities. We expect to continue to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions. We evaluate acquisition opportunities on a variety of factors, including investment in clinical science, product innovation and strategic and financial considerations.
Clinical Trials 
In the United States, a significant risk device requires the prior submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to FDA for approval before initiating a clinical trial. Clinical trials are required to support a pre-market approval (PMA) and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Some trials require a feasibility study followed by a pivotal trial. We are conducting several clinical trials to validate the long-term results of procedures using our products and to support applications to regulatory agencies for expanded indications. In addition, we also conduct various studies to gather clinical data regarding our products. Key trials and studies are:
CONVERGE. We conducted the CONVERGE IDE clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology to treat symptomatic persistent and long-standing persistent Afib patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I and/or III anti-arrhythmic drug. In April 2021, we announced the PMA approval of the EPi-Sense System for treatment of symptomatic, drug-refractory, long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, when augmented with an endocardial ablation catheter. We believe the Convergent procedure, or Hybrid AF 
Table of Contents

therapy, provides the only compelling treatment option for a large and vastly underpenetrated population of Afib patients. The CONVERGE trial demonstrated superiority in the hybrid therapy arm compared to endocardial catheter ablation alone. In patients diagnosed with long-standing persistent Afib, the therapy arm showed a 29% absolute difference in efficacy at 12 months (78% relative improvement) and an absolute difference of 35% at 18 months (110% relative improvement). There was also a 33% absolute difference in Afib burden reduction in favor of the Hybrid AF therapy at 12 months, which increased to 37% at 18 months. In April 2021, we also received approval from FDA to conduct the CONVERGE Post Approval Study (PAS). This study allows for 325 patients to be enrolled at up to 50 sites.
aMAZE. In connection with our acquisition of SentreHEART in August 2019, we are conducting the aMAZE IDE clinical trial. aMAZE is an FDA-approved, prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluating the LARIAT system for LAA exclusion adjunctive to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) catheter ablation for the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib. The objective of the aMAZE IDE trial is to demonstrate that using the LARIAT system for LAA exclusion, plus a PVI catheter ablation, will lead to a reduced incidence of recurrent Afib compared to PVI alone, with a favorable safety profile. The aMAZE IDE trial provides enrollment of up to 600 patients at 65 sites with one-year follow up. Enrollment was completed in December 2019, and patient follow-up for twelve months post PVI catheter ablation required by the study protocol was completed in April 2021. In January 2020, we received approval under a continued access protocol (CAP) for additional patient enrollment of up to 85 patients at existing aMAZE IDE trial sites. In July 2021, the Company was informed that data from the aMAZE clinical trial did not achieve statistical superiority for the primary effectiveness endpoint. Specifically, while the trial met the safety endpoint, the trial did not meet the primary effectiveness endpoint. The Company has stopped enrollment in the aMAZE CAP, and is in the process of further analyzing aMAZE trial data and determining the next steps for the trial, PMA application and any future development activities.
ICE-AFIB. The ICE-AFIB clinical trial is designed to study the safety and efficacy of the cryoICE® system for persistent and long-standing persistent Afib treatment during concomitant on-pump cardiac surgery. The trial provides for enrollment of up to 150 patients at up to 20 sites in the United States. Enrollment began in January 2019 and remains ongoing.
DEEP AF Pivotal Study. The DEEP AF IDE pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the AtriCure Bipolar System when used in a staged approach where a minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed. The patient undergoes the endocardial catheter procedure approximately 91-120 days later. The study began in 2014 and was paused during 2016-2017 due to our work to mitigate the risk related to esophageal injury during the procedure. We are committed to patient safety, and we worked collaboratively with FDA and obtained approval to resume enrollment in the trial in 2018 starting with 40 patients. All 40 patients have been enrolled and treated, and in July 2021, we received FDA approval to enroll the full cohort of 220 patients. We are evaluating next steps to resume enrollment. 
CEASE AF. We are also pursuing a non-IDE trial in Europe to compare staged hybrid ablation treatment (minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 91-180 days later) versus catheter ablation alone. Enrollment began in November 2015. However, we have temporarily suspended enrollment to perform an interim data analysis.
Sales, Marketing and Medical Education 
Our global sales and marketing efforts focus on educating physicians about our unique technologies and their technical benefits. We only promote our products for uses described in their labeling as cleared or approved by the relevant regulatory agencies. We train our sales force on the use of our products to the extent the products are cleared or approved.
Our sales team in the United States has approximately 220 employees supporting approximately 57 sales territories. We select our sales personnel based on their expertise, sales experience and reputation in the medical device industry, and their knowledge of cardiac and thoracic surgery procedures and technologies.
We market and sell our products in selected countries outside of the United States through a combination of independent distributors and direct sales personnel. Our international sales team includes sales representatives focused on our direct markets, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux region. We also maintain a network of distributors in Asia, South America and Canada, as well as certain countries in Europe, who market and sell our products. We continue to evaluate opportunities for further expansion into markets outside of the United States.

Competition
Our industry is competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Most of our competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do and have relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours. Our primary competitor in the cardiac surgery market is Medtronic, plc, who provides similar surgical ablation products to ours that have been adopted by physicians for the treatment of Afib and related conditions. AtriCure has the only medical devices that are approved by FDA for treating long-standing persistent Afib: the Isolator Synergy Ablation, the first medical device to receive FDA approval for the treatment of persistent Afib in a concomitant setting, and the EPi-Sense System, which recently received FDA PMA approval for Hybrid AF Therapy. Several other companies offer intracardiac catheter devices that are commonly used by electrophysiologists to treat Afib. These catheter devices are FDA-approved to treat the paroxysmal and persistent forms of Afib, but they are not FDA indicated to treat long-standing persistent Afib. AtriCure is monitoring other companies who are conducting clinical trials that may support FDA approval of their devices to treat persistent and long-standing persistent Afib, although we are not aware of any ongoing FDA trials by other companies to study ablation of long-standing persistent Afib patients. We believe that our products compare favorably against competing products during both open-heart and minimally invasive procedures, and that our products improve treatment outcomes for patients with non-paroxysmal forms of Afib when combined with intracardiac catheter devices. In addition to the cardiac surgery market, we also consider competition within the post-operative pain market. At this time, we are not aware of other companies in the United States who are pursuing cryothermic nerve block therapies for thoracic surgery. There are other companies outside of the United States who market their devices for a similar therapy. 
To compete effectively, we strive to demonstrate that our products are an attractive alternative or addition to other treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of safety, efficacy, performance, ease of use, reputation, service and impact on healthcare economics. In addition, we invest heavily in training and education to ensure that our customers understand available devices, techniques and approaches for optimal treatment. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who prefer products offered by our competitors.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors. These payors include private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal health benefit program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and covers certain medical care items and services for eligible beneficiaries, such as individuals over 65 years old, as well as chronically disabled individuals. Because Medicare beneficiaries comprise a large percentage of the populations for which our products are used, and private insurers may follow the coverage and payment policies for Medicare, Medicare’s coding, coverage and payment policies for cardiothoracic surgical procedures are significant to our business.
Medicare’s Part A program pays hospitals for inpatient services, such as cardiothoracic surgery, under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System, which provides a predetermined payment based on the patient’s discharge diagnoses and surgical procedure(s). Discharge diagnoses are grouped into Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groupings (MS-DRG). There are several cardiac surgery MS-DRGs associated with the surgical treatment of Afib, with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure. When an ablation device and/or LAA exclusion device (LAAM) is used during a concomitant open-heart procedure, Medicare’s hospital reimbursement is based upon the patient’s primary structural heart surgical procedure. In contrast, sole therapy minimally invasive ablation or surgical LAAM procedures typically are reimbursed under a general cardiac surgery MS-DRG. We believe hospital reimbursement rates for sole therapy and concomitant therapy cardiac surgical ablation or LAAM are adequate to cover the cost of our products even when multiple procedures are performed.
Physicians are reimbursed for their services separately under the Medicare Part B physician fee schedule. When performing a surgical cardiac ablation with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure, surgeons report Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to receive a professional fee payment. Multiple CPT codes may be reported by a physician during a procedure if multiple procedures are performed. There are category one CPT codes for both concomitant and standalone surgical Afib treatment, as well as surgical LAAM. However, some providers utilize unlisted CPT codes to obtain reimbursement in these situations.
In addition to the Medicare program, many private payors look to CMS policies as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts. The current coverage policies of these private payors may differ from the Medicare program, and payment rates may be higher, lower, or the same as the Medicare program. In some cases, certain

private payors adopt negative coverage policies with respect to therapies involving our products. We engage third-party reimbursement consultants that provide support to our customers in the event of a coverage denial.
Outside of the United States, third-party reimbursement varies widely by geography and by the type of therapy in which our devices are used. For example, even though a new medical device may have been approved for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors. In addition, some private third-party payors require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. In some countries, cost containment initiatives and health care reforms include initiatives like governmental reviews of reimbursement rate benchmarks, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures altogether. We are actively working to pursue market access in certain geographies, which includes applying for new reimbursement for therapies in which our devices are being used or pursuing specific reimbursement for utilization of our devices.
Government Regulation 
Our products are medical devices and are subject to regulation in the United States by FDA and other federal agencies, and by comparable authorities in the European Union (EU) and other countries worldwide.
US Regulation:
FDA regulations govern nearly all of the activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. FDA regulates the total product lifecycle from early design, development and testing, to manufacturing and commercialization activities, as well as post-market surveillance and reporting, including corrective actions, removals and recalls. Unless an exemption applies, most medical devices distributed in the United States require either 510(k) clearance or PMA from FDA. 
510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a notification to FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, i.e., a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or a change in its design or manufacture that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance. 
Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA must be submitted to FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and is not otherwise exempt. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical, real world data, manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. A PMA supplement is required for changes affecting the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including but not limited to new indications for use, a different manufacturing facility, or changes in the manufacturing process, labeling, or design specifications or components of the device.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to current good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the written informed consent of patients in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and other human subject protection regulations established by FDA. We must conduct our clinical studies in compliance with state and federal privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
Educational Grants. FDA regulates the promotion of medical devices by manufacturers and prohibits the promotion by manufacturers of uses that are not within the approved or cleared labeling of the device. FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine or the conduct or content of medical education conducted by third parties, which may include uses that are not within approved or cleared device labeling. Manufacturers may provide unrestricted financial support for independent third-party medical education programs in the form of educational grants intended to offset the cost of such programs. If the manufacturer controls or unduly influences the content of such programs, FDA considers those programs to be promotional activities by the manufacturer and thus subject to FDA regulation including promotional restrictions. We seek to ensure that our educational grants program is conducted in accordance with FDA criteria for independent educational activities. However, we cannot provide an assurance that FDA or other government authorities would view the third-party programs we have supported as being independent.

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved by FDA, including, but not limited to: annual establishment registration and product listing; current good manufacturing practice for devices, referred to as the Quality System Regulation (QSR); labeling requirements and advertising and promotion guidelines; assessing the significance of any changes to a device; monitoring and reporting serious and adverse events and certain device malfunctions; and reporting certain device corrections and removals. Our manufacturing facilities and processes are also subject to FDA inspections to ensure compliance with QSR.
In addition to FDA regulation, the advertising and promotion of certain medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. On occasion, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products can be the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims. We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers. In particular, the Anti-Kickback Statute is a federal criminal law that applies broadly and prohibits the knowing and willful offer or payment of remuneration to induce or reward patient referrals or the generation of business involving any item or service payable by a federal health care program. The federal False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States government. Damages under the FCA consist of the imposition of fines and penalties and can be significant. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages.
AtriCure is a member of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), a voluntary United States trade association for medical device manufacturers. This association has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code of Ethics for Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (the “AdvaMed Code”) by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the Office of the Inspector General and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. We have adopted the AdvaMed Code and incorporated its principles in our standard operating procedures, employee training programs and relationships with medical professionals.
AtriCure is a member of MedTech Europe, a voluntary trade association for the medical technology industry including diagnostics, medical devices and digital health. MedTech Europe and its members are committed to a high level of ethical business practices and have put in place strict guidelines to advise medical technology manufacturers on how to collaborate ethically with healthcare professionals (HCPs). These guidelines are set out in the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice (MedTech Code), which regulates all aspects of the industry's relationships with HCPs and healthcare organizations (HCOs). It covers medical education and research and development. It also introduces an independent enforcement mechanism and transparency obligations. The Code sets clear and transparent rules for the industry's relationships with HCPs and HCOs, including company events, third party organized events, arrangements with consultants, gifts, research and financial support to medical education. We have adopted the MedTech Code and incorporated its principles in our standard operating procedures, employee training programs and relationships with medical professionals.
Regulation Outside of the United States:
Sales of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval and the requirements may be different, but the general trend is toward increasing regulation and greater requirements for the manufacturer to provide more bench testing and clinical evidence. 
While some harmonization of global regulations has occurred, requirements continue to differ significantly. In China, for example, the product must first have approval in the country of origin. In China, successful results from local product safety testing precedes submission of documentation to obtain approval. In addition, regulatory agencies and authorities can halt distribution within the country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws.
Conformity Assessment Pathway. In the European Union, various directives regulate the design, manufacture and labeling of medical devices, and more stringent conformity assessment requirements have been put in place with the 2017 
Table of Contents

Medical Device Regulation, effective May 26, 2021. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but typically involves a combination of quality system assessment and product conformity assessment by a third-party notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment includes a review of documentation related to the device that may be as extensive as the documentation requirements that the United States FDA requires for higher risk products. The notified body also audits the manufacturer’s quality system and performs a detailed review of the testing of the manufacturer’s device. Successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure allows a manufacturer to issue a declaration of conformity with the requirements of the relevant directive and affix the CE mark to the device. Devices that bear the CE mark may be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union and other countries that comply with or mirror the medical device directives or medical device regulations.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product has been approved by the notified body for CE marking, including, but not limited to: labeling, advertising and promotion, reporting of device modifications, monitoring the safety of the product and performing corrections and removals when necessary, maintaining “state of the art” requirements for the devices through compliance with standards, and obtaining recertification of the quality system and individual device certificates on a periodic basis.
Intellectual Property
Protection of our intellectual property is a priority for our business, and we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our interests. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights in the continued development and commercialization of our technologies and products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights is important to our continued success. We will be able to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks or copyrights, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. 
We hold numerous issued United States and international patents. We also have multiple pending United States and international patent applications. We seek patent protection relating to technologies and products we develop in both the United States and in selected foreign countries. While we own much of our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information, we also license patents and related technology of importance to the commercialization of our products. To continue developing and commercializing our current and future products, we may license intellectual property from commercial or academic entities to obtain the rights to technology that is required for our research, development and commercialization activities.
All of our employees and technical consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also generally require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with their relationship with us. We devote significant resources to obtaining patents and other intellectual property and protecting our other proprietary information. If valid and enforceable, these patents may give us a means of blocking competitors from using infringing technology to compete directly with our products. We also have proprietary information that may not be patentable. With respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, we have chosen to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. 
Manufacturing 
We assemble, inspect, test and package the majority of our products at our facilities in Ohio, and our products are sterilized by third parties. Purchased components are generally sourced from a single supplier, but alternatives to these suppliers are available in the event this would be needed. 
To minimize supply chain risks, we maintain inventory levels of components and raw materials specific to the respective part or device. We assess tooling and equipment on an ongoing basis. Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components.
We regularly audit our suppliers for compliance with our quality system requirements, the QSR and/or applicable ISO standards. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer and certified to ISO 13485:2016. In addition, we have successfully participated in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) and have been certified accordingly. The MDSAP program is recognized in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States.

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control. 
Consulting Relationships 
We have developed consulting relationships with scientists and physicians throughout the world to support our research and development, clinical and training and education programs. We work closely with these thought leaders to understand unmet needs and emerging applications for the treatment of Afib and other diseases and conditions.
Our physician consulting agreements are intended to satisfy the requirements of the personal services “Safe Harbor” regulation as well as the AdvaMed Code and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice. As such, they provide for payment of a fair market value fee only for legitimate services rendered to us. We do not expect or require the consultant to utilize or promote our products, and consultants are required to disclose their relationship with us as appropriate, such as when publishing an article in which one of our products is discussed. Amounts paid to physicians in the United States are disclosed by us in annual reports submitted to CMS under the federal “Open Payments” law. Amounts paid to physicians in certain other countries are also disclosed by us in reports submitted to various governmental agencies in those countries, in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions where those physicians reside or practice, or where the payments are made.
Human Capital Management 
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our internal processes to increase employee engagement, productivity and efficiency.
We had approximately 875 employees as of January 31, 2022. None of the employees were represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages. We consider our employee relations to be in good standing. At AtriCure, the employee experience is crucial to the ongoing success of the company. We work to provide a culture that augments the intrinsic rewards of our mission – one where employees feel valued and supported every day. We strive to engage with our employees across every level of the organization, celebrate their personal milestones and cultivate a sense of trust and transparency. Our culture provides opportunities for employees to feel a part of a community through paid leave for volunteering and individual recognition with “Heart of AtriCure” awards. Our employees have voted us as a Top Workplace six times in the past seven years, and our culture is regularly cited in our internal engagement surveys as a leading positive attribute of the Company. Our culture is a central asset to our Company.
Employee Compensation and Benefits
Competitive compensation and benefits are an integral part of our efforts to attract and retain world-class talent. We are committed to regularly analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and benchmarking our programs against the market and our industry peers. Annual pay increases and other forms of incentive compensation are based on performance and market evaluation. Performance expectations are communicated to employees at the time of hiring, as well as upon internal transfer or promotion, and documented through our performance management process as part of our annual review procedures.
Benefits for eligible U.S.-based employees include medical, dental and vision insurance; paid leave for both vacation and illness; a 401(k) plan that includes a company matching contribution; a stock purchase plan enabling employees to purchase AtriCure stock at a reduced price; and life and disability insurance. Our international employee benefits vary due to local regulations and offerings. We ensure compliance with all statutory and mandatory benefits which vary by country, such as medical, disability, retirement/pension, workers compensation, accident, social benefits and paid leave. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We have an ongoing commitment to advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) throughout our workplace and the communities in which we operate. By honoring the dignity of each person, we foster a culture of inclusion where everyone is welcome. We do this by embracing diverse voices and experiences, supporting programs and resources that build an authentic and respectful workplace and providing fair and equitable opportunities for each person to contribute meaningfully in both their work and their personal lives.

We believe our workforce needs to be diverse, and leverage the skills and perspectives of a variety of backgrounds and experiences. To attract a global workforce, we strive to embed a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work. Our 2021 DE&I efforts were overseen internally by our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion leader and Chief Human Resources Officer who work to further advance our commitment and programs by fostering employee understanding, intentionality and measurable processes. 
Training and Development
Employee training and development is a priority at AtriCure. We strive to create an environment where employees can realize their potential. We provide a range of training courses and online resources, as well as developmental coaching and mentoring. We have a regular monthly schedule of opportunities that allows employees to access both instructor-led classrooms and self-directed web-based courses. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next-generation leaders, and conduct a comprehensive review of our leadership team on an annual basis. In that process, we review existing leaders and prospective leaders throughout the organization and determine next best steps for their future development. Developmental plans for employees can range from leadership support to technical skill-building.
We also work to ensure all employees have access to training that is consistent with the competencies that are measured as part of performance management: Delivering Results with Accountability, Initiative and Involvement, Teamwork and Support, and for those who manage people, Develop and Maintain High Performance Teams and Communication.
Safety for All Employees
We are committed to maintaining a safe workplace and promoting the well-being of all of our employees. We have implemented multiple safety programs and regularly perform safety hazard evaluations within our facilities. Programs include our Emergency Site Action Plan for emergencies such as fire response, severe weather threats and shelter in place incidents, as well as our Certified First Responders safety program that include Red Cross training of employees in CPR, AED Usage and First Aid practices. We recognize that the use of tobacco is linked to many adverse health effects, including those that impact the heart, and we offer our employees tobacco cessation programs. Effective January 1, 2021, our Ohio office locations are entirely tobacco- and nicotine-free, and to the extent permitted in the states of our other offices, those locations are also entirely tobacco- and nicotine-free.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees have been our first and foremost focus. We have implemented a number of long-term measures to provide a safe work environment for our employees. AtriCure has provided regular, mandatory training for all employees on COVID-19 protocols that are consistent with Center for Disease Control recommendations and state and country-specific guidelines. Such protocols and guidance is continually updated and made available to employees. We have also established decision-making protocols for contact tracing, return to work, and sanitization. Employees who are able to perform essential functions of their job remotely are allowed to do so. For those who need to be in a facility to perform their work, strict adherence to our COVID-19 protocols is required, including temperature checks, wearing face coverings, socially-distancing and other best practices surrounding hygiene to mitigate virus spread. We have not implemented any temporary or permanent reductions in headcount or to non-executive employee compensation.
