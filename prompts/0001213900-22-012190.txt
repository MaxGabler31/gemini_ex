Item 1. Business



Unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”, “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company, a Delaware corporation.



Overview



We are a resort and entertainment company leveraging the power and popularity of professional football and its legendary players in partnership with the National Football Museum, Inc., doing business as the Pro Football Hall of Fame (“PFHOF”). Headquartered in Canton, Ohio, we own the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls, a multi-use sports and entertainment destination centered around the PFHOF’s campus. We expect to create a diversified set of revenue streams through developing themed attractions, premier entertainment programming and sponsorships. The strategic plan has been developed in three phases of growth: Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III.



Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls is operational, consisting of the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the Sports Complex, and HOF Village Media Group, LLC (“Hall of Fame Village Media” or the “Media Company”). In 2016, HOF Village substantially completed the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, a sports and entertainment venue with a seating capacity of approximately 23,000, with continued development of the end zones in 2021. The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosts multiple sports and entertainment events, including the NFL Hall of Fame Game, Enshrinement and Concert for Legends during the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week. In 2016, HOF Village opened the Sports Complex, which will consist of eight full-sized, multi-use regulation football fields, five of which have been completed in Phase I. The facility hosts camps and tournaments for football players, as well as athletes from across the country in other sports such as lacrosse, rugby and soccer. In 2017, HOF Village formed a sports and entertainment media company, Hall of Fame Village Media, leveraging the sport of professional football to produce exclusive programming by licensing the extensive content controlled by the PFHOF as well as new programming assets developed from live events such as youth tournaments, camps and sporting events held at the Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.



We are developing new hospitality, attraction and corporate assets surrounding the Pro Football Hall of Fame Museum as part of our Phase II development plan. Phase II plans for future components of the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls include two hotels (one on campus and one in downtown Canton that opened in November 2020), the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, the Constellation Center for Excellence (an office building including retail and meeting space, that opened in October 2021), the Center for Performance (a convention center/field house), the Play Action Plaza, and the Hall of Fame Retail Promenade. We are pursuing a differentiation strategy across three pillars, including destination-based assets, the Media Company, and gaming (including the fantasy football league we acquired a majority stake in 2020). Phase III expansion plans may include a potential mix of residential space, additional attractions, entertainment, dining, merchandise and more.

Corporate History and Background




The Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company (formerly known as GPAQ Acquisition Holdings, Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware on August 29, 2019 as a subsidiary of Gordon Pointe Acquisition Corp. (“GPAQ”), a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets.



On July 1, 2020, we consummated the business combination with HOF Village, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HOF Village”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September 16, 2019 (as amended on November 6, 2019, March 10, 2020 and May 22, 2020, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, GPAQ Acquiror Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Acquiror Merger Sub”), GPAQ Company Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Company Merger Sub”), HOF Village and HOF Village Newco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Newco”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Business Combination.”



Upon the consummation of the Business Combination: (i) Acquiror Merger Sub merged with and into GPAQ, with GPAQ continuing as the surviving entity (the “Acquiror Merger”) and (ii) Company Merger Sub merged with and into Newco, with Newco continuing as the surviving entity (the “Company Merger”). In advance of the Company Merger, HOF Village transferred all of its assets, liabilities and obligations to Newco pursuant to a contribution agreement. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name from “GPAQ Acquisition Holdings, Inc.” to “Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company.” As a result of the Business Combination, GPAQ and Newco continue as our wholly owned subsidiaries.



In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination and pursuant to the Merger Agreement: (a) each issued and outstanding unit of GPAQ, if not already detached, was detached and each holder of such a unit was deemed to hold one share of GPAQ Class A common stock and one GPAQ warrant (“GPAQ Warrant”), (b) each issued and outstanding share of GPAQ Class A common stock (excluding any shares held by a GPAQ stockholder that elected to have its shares redeemed pursuant to GPAQ’s organizational documents) was converted automatically into the right to receive 1.421333 shares of our Common Stock, following which all shares of GPAQ Class A common stock ceased to be outstanding and were automatically canceled and cease to exist; (c) each issued and outstanding share of GPAQ Class F common stock was converted automatically into the right to receive one share of Common Stock, following which all shares of GPAQ Class F common stock ceased to be outstanding and were automatically canceled and cease to exist; (d) each issued and outstanding GPAQ Warrant (including GPAQ private placement warrants) was automatically converted into one Warrant (which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a “Series A Warrant”) to purchase 1.421333 shares of Common Stock per warrant, following which all GPAQ Warrants ceased to be outstanding and were automatically canceled and retired and cease to exist; and (e) each issued and outstanding membership interest in Newco converted automatically into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Company Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which was payable in shares of Common Stock.



The rights of holders of our Common Stock and Series A Warrants are governed by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our amended and restated bylaws (the “Bylaws’) and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and in the case of our Series A Warrants, the Warrant Agreement, dated January 24, 2018, between GPAQ and the Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. On November 3, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock from 100,000,000 to 300,000,000.



Upon consummation of the Business Combination and, in connection therewith, we became a successor issuer to GPAQ by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Business Strategy



Our unique position and multimedia approach makes us the only company of our kind fully poised to capitalize on the popularity of professional football, one of the most popular brands in sports (as measured by total league revenue and number of fans). Our principal business objectives are to successfully develop and operate destination based assets such as the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls as a premiere destination resort and entertainment company leveraging the expansive popularity of professional football and PFHOF; Hall of Fame Village Media taking advantage of direct access to exclusive content; and a gaming vertical including fantasy sports, and potential growth across eGaming and sports betting. The resort and entertainment platform will significantly extend the presence of PFHOF, the singular institution focused on promoting and preserving the legends and values of professional football. We are located in Canton, Ohio, the birthplace of American professional football. It is in a market area with limited themed attractions and within an 8-hour driving distance to nearly half of the NFL franchises. Together with the PFHOF, we intend to become an elite entertainment venue and premier attraction for the region. The current operational assets of the PFHOF and the Company currently attract approximately two million visitors annually.



We are building a year-round, multi-use destination complex with a master development plan that calls for the three phases described in greater detail below. Phase I, substantially complete, includes the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the Sports Complex, Hall of Fame Village Media, and complementary, long-term sponsorship agreements, as well as land and infrastructure to support Phase II and Phase III. Phase II, already begun, will add the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, hotels as well as additional attractions, retail and commercial assets. Phase III expansion plans may include a potential mix of residential space, additional attractions, entertainment, dining, merchandise and more.



Strategic Relationship with PFHOF




PFHOF is a distinct entity from the Company but serves as a significant shareholder and aligned partner. The Pro Football Hall of Fame Museum (the “Museum”), which is owned and operated by PFHOF and not the Company, is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational institution that focuses on the education, promotion, preservation and honoring of the individuals and moments that shaped professional football’s history. Since opening in 1963, the Museum has grown in both size and stature. The building was expanded in 1971, 1978 and 1995, and completed major exhibit gallery renovations in 2003, 2008, and 2009. Together, these improvements have transformed the original 19,000 square-foot Museum into an exciting internationally recognized institution and travel destination. The “Future 50” Expansion & Renovation Project has expanded the museum to 118,000 square feet. The two-year, $27 million project was completed in the summer of 2013 after a major renovation to 38,000 square feet of Museum space was finished. Today, the Museum stands as a shining tribute to the over 300 men who have earned their Gold Jackets and made professional football America’s most popular sport. The Museum and the Gold Jacket inductees serve as unique and valuable partners that contribute to the development of the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls.



See the section entitled “Risk Factors – The success of our business is substantially dependent upon the continued success of the PFHOF brand and museum experience and our ability to continue to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with PFHOF and its management team” for additional information relating to the relationship with PFHOF.



About Phase I



We have invested approximately $250 million of capital to build Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls in preparation for Phase II and Phase III. Phase I, substantially complete, includes the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the Sports Complex, Hall of Fame Village Media, complementary, long-term sponsorship agreements, as well as land and infrastructure to support Phase II and Phase III. We are executing strategies to significantly increase programming of the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium and Sports Complex and developing unique media content through Hall of Fame Village Media.
Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium



The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium holds up to approximately 23,000 spectators and hosts the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week powered by Johnson Controls as well as other premier sporting events such as the Historic Black College Hall of Fame Game, and the Ohio State High School Football Championships. During the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week, the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosts the Hall of Fame Game, the first nationally televised NFL game of the pre-season, and the Hall of Fame Enshrinement. The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium is also equipped with cut-away seats, allowing it to serve as an elite concert venue. The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium has hosted performances by national recording artists such as Aerosmith, Tim McGraw, Pitbull, Toby Keith and Maroon 5.
Sports Complex



The Sports Complex will consist of eight full sized fields, five of which are completed (four turf fields and one grass field) and three of which are in the process of construction as part of Phase II. The facility hosts camps and tournaments for football players as well as athletes from other sports such as lacrosse, rugby and soccer from across the country.

Hall of Fame Village Media



In 2017, HOF Village formed a sports and entertainment media company, Hall of Fame Village Media, leveraging the sport of professional football to produce exclusive content, including content developed from live events such as tournaments, camps and sporting events held at the Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. Hall of Fame Village Media has the ability to develop multiple media formats including full length feature films, live and taped television specials, studio shows, live sports events, books and artwork. Through our partnership with the PFHOF, Hall of Fame Village Media has access to over 50 million pieces of photo, video and document archives. To date, Hall of Fame Village Media has produced broadcasts for the World Youth Football Championships aired on CBS, National Signing Day, during which top high school athletes announce their college commitments and is in the initial stages of producing six different sports related shows. Future live content is also expected to include programming with the NFL Alumni Association, including the NFL Alumni Academy taking part on the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls campus in Canton, Ohio.



In 2021, Hall of Fame Village Media began developing and selling Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”), focused on highlighting memorable plays of the college and professional careers of six legendary athletes.



In 2021, Hall of Fame Village Media co-produced the World Chase Tag primetime special on ESPN, which was also hosted at the Hall of Fame Village.



Sponsorship Agreements



We are bringing together world-class sponsors and partners. To date, we have struck formal agreements related to sponsorship alliances for development support from best-in-class companies, including Johnson Controls, the founding partner and official naming rights partner, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. (an Exelon Company), the official energy partner, First Data Merchant Services, LLC (now Fiserv), the official processing and payment solutions partner, Forever Lawn, the official artificial turf partner, Republic Services of Ohio, LLC, the preferred waste and recycling partner, Commscope, the official data communications networking partner, and Cleveland Clinic, the official health care provider of the Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.



Generally, under the terms of our sponsorship agreements, we will receive a fixed amount of revenue each year in exchange for granting certain rights to the relevant sponsor. The revenue may consist of a combination of cash, in-kind and/or activation funds. However, in some cases, the sponsorship fee may consist of a fixed initial payment with variable annual payments thereafter, based on our completion of certain projects or fulfillment of certain requirements.



Under the terms of the Naming Rights Agreement (as defined below), we will receive a fixed amount of revenue each year in return for granting to Johnson Controls, Inc. (“JCI” or “Johnson Controls”) exclusive rights to designate the name of the destination complex as well as granting to Johnson Controls certain branding, signage, advertising and similar rights. The Naming Rights Agreement is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2034, subject to certain termination rights discussed below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business – We rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues.” We are obligated to spend $18 million as activation expenses for the benefit of promoting the Johnson Controls and our brands.



Under the terms of the Constellation Sponsorship Agreement (as defined below), we will receive a fixed amount of revenue each year in return for granting Constellation (as defined below) exclusive rights to designate the name of the Constellation Center for Excellence as well as granting Constellation certain branding, signage, advertising and similar rights. The Constellation Sponsorship Agreement is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2029. The annual revenue consists of sponsorship fees and annual activation fund proceeds. Activation fund proceeds may be used for a media plan, hospitality packages, business development and other expenses for the benefit of promoting the Constellation brand and our brands. Annual activation fund proceeds must be used in a particular calendar year, and any unused funds are not rolled into future contract years.



See the section entitled “Risk Factors — We rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenue” for additional terms and conditions relating to the Naming Rights Agreement and the Constellation Sponsorship Agreement.



About Phase II



Phase II is expected to add additional strategic attractions, hospitality, and corporate assets in a well-planned and synergistic manner intended to increase consumer appeal and drive revenue and profitability growth. The Company has made material progress toward the full execution of Phase II.



To date, either through ground leases, purchase agreements, or through acquisition of title, the Company has acquired all land and received zoning approval from the City of Canton for the development of Phase II. In 2016 and 2017, the Company received significant support from the City of Canton through a pair of ordinances. In June 2016, the Planning Commission of the City of Canton amended the Planning and Zoning Code of Codified Ordinances of the City of Canton to include the Hall of Fame Village District, providing us with a zoning mechanism required to implement our mixed-use development plan. In February 2017, the Planning Commission of the City of Canton and City Council granted approval of the Hall of Fame Village Development plan, including plans for Phase II. The Company has gained control of over 200 parcels of land surrounding the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, Sports Complex, and the Museum for the future development of the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, on-campus hotel attached to the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, and a retail promenade offering a variety of food and beverage options, as well as other specialized entertainment alternatives. The Company has commissioned and completed three separate Phase I Environmental Site Assessments on land underlying the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, Sports Complex and residential land acquired for Phase II of the development plan. To date, no recognized environmental conditions have been revealed.

In addition, the Company has made significant progress in the design and construction of Phase II. Phase II is projected to cost approximately $330 million in capital spending. Construction began in 2020 and all components of Phase II are expected to be complete and operational by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2018, the Company added significantly to its construction and planning resources with the goal of developing and delivering Company assets on time and on budget.



The Company’s master general contractors delivered schematic and design documents in March 2020. Required permits have been identified and are in the process of being secured. The Company received a Guaranteed Maximum Price (“GMP”) commitment from its project management consultants and general contractors in the first quarter of 2021. The GMP, along with the design and development work completed, will serve as critical elements in arranging a construction loan to meet the proposed schedule. The strategic plan reflects the projected $330 million in capital spending, with a construction loan/equity/public financing used to support this spending and any other costs associated with completion and the attractive financial return characteristics of these assets.



In Phase II, the critical business strategies are to drive further asset development, increased event programming, new alliance sponsorships, media development and explore additional growth verticals:




● | Further Asset Development: We are constructing additional assets in Phase II to attract and entertain guests. We have acquired or entered into agreements to acquire all land needed for Phase II development and have completed all of the design and development. In November 2020, HOF Village, opened its DoubleTree by Hilton hotel. Additional assets will include the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, an on-campus hotel attached to the waterpark, and a retail promenade offering a variety of food and beverage options, as well as other specialized entertainment alternatives. In October 2021, we opened our Constellation Center for Excellence, which is an office complex expanding the corporate appeal of HOF Village. There will also be a Center for Performance to provide a variety of year-round programming options, including the NFL Alumni Academy. A green space area which will be called Play-Action Plaza is expected to provide 3.5 acres for fun, football-themed recreation, events, and formal gatherings. Future destination-based assets may include live entertainment, gaming, dining, and more all over the country alongside major NFL franchise cities.

● | Increased Event Programming: We are planning to utilize the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium for an expanded offering of live entertainment and events, including top performers, sporting events and festival programming. Also, given the appeal and popularity of youth sports, additional year-round programming is expected to be available across multiple sports utilizing the national appeal of the Hall of Fame brand. HOF Village has made key strategic hires and partnerships who will help drive increased Event Programming and Alliance Sponsorships. During 2022, we will be hosting the USFL finals and semi-finals, along with a “Fatherhood Festival” in June. There are also plans for multiple concerts, multi-day festivals, and on-going business event productions.

● | New Alliance Sponsorships: We have been successful attracting a strong sponsorship base and plan to continue to form significant partnerships with leading companies and brands across a range of untapped categories. These partnerships are expected to be in the form of naming rights agreements or additional category-specific sponsorships. HOF Village plans to target a number of industry verticals for additional sponsorship revenue, such as autos, telecom and beverages. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Media Development: We are developing original content from both our event programming and its direct access to millions of pieces of historic professional football artifacts located within the PFHOF archive through Hall of Fame Village Media. We are planning on producing full-length films, shows and other digital content marketing through multiple channels of distribution. Already advanced discussions with media leaders, creative, development and distribution partners have occurred. In September 2020, we hired an Executive Vice President of Content Development/Distribution, who previously served in a similar capacity as our outside consultant, to assess and identify market opportunities for content development, develop a business plan for the Media Company, identify sources of new creative content, and engage in discussions with distributor channels to identify the types of content they are seeking. We are working on expanding our team and partnerships and have a robust slate of new content in development.

● | Hall of Fame Village Gaming: eGaming is expected to be the connective tissue that integrates the rest of the business units across the Company. This encompasses youth sports as a way to increase engagement, as well as gaming as a part of offsite asset building and programming, purpose-driven physical destination resort locations, and broadcast/streaming gaming content within media. We entered the high-growth vertical of fantasy sports with the launch of the Hall of Fantasy League in fall 2021, which has completed its first season, with geo-based franchises professionally managed with ownership and influence from the public. There is potential for industry expertise to be provided by experienced fantasy analysts, NFL Hall of Famers, and NFL Alumni. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sports Betting: We recently announced online and onsite retail partnerships to take advantage of sports betting. We are beginning to develop sports betting both online and on campus through these recently announced partnerships in connection with legislation that recently legalized sports betting in the State of Ohio, subject to obtaining the needed entity and individual gaming licenses. We are poised to utilize existing brand partnerships with our newly rebranded Hall of Fantasy League and eGaming, both of which we believe could be designed to accept sports wagering. In March 2022, we hired an executive vice president of gaming to lead our gaming division. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring Additional Growth Verticals: HOF Village has begun exploring additional growth verticals as part of Phase II. There also are expected to be opportunities to consider expanding certain destination-based assets in other geographic markets leveraging the popularity of professional football. We have hired several additional full-time employees to actively research these and other growth verticals. These Additional Growth Verticals are not included in the current set of financial projections. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About Phase III



With Phase I and Phase II assets providing a solid foundation, growth is expected to continue with the development of Phase III, including a potential mix of residential space, and additional attractions, entertainment, dining, merchandise and more. This next phase of development would potentially be initiated upon substantial completion of Phase II. The financial performance of Phase III is not currently fully reflected in the financial projections contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition



We currently face and will face competition in each of our businesses, as follows:

● | The Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, the Hall of Fame hotels and the retail promenade, if and when completed, will compete with other theme parks and resorts, such as Cedar Point, located in Sandusky, Ohio, and other retail and tourist destinations in Ohio and around the country, and with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Constellation Center for Excellence and Fan Engagement Zone will compete for tenants with other suppliers of commercial and/or retail space.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees



As of March 14, 2022, we had 52 employees (45 full-time employees, 2 part-time employees, and 5 temporary interns) that perform various administrative, finance and accounting, event planning, sports programming, media development, and corporate management functions for the Company and its subsidiaries.
Properties



We own real property in Canton, Ohio, at the site of the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls development. Certain parcels of real property on which the Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls is located are owned by the City of Canton and the Canton City School District (Board of Education), and are subject to long-term ground leases and agreements with us for the use and development of such property.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.



Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Company’s initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30.



The COVID-19 Pandemic



Since 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 and the measures to prevent its spread impacted our business in a number of ways, most significantly with regard to a reduction in the number of events and attendance at events at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium and Sports Complex, which negatively impacts our ability to sell sponsorships. Also, we opened our newly renovated DoubleTree by Hilton in Canton in November 2020, but the occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a number of supply chain disruptions, which negatively impacts our ability to obtain the materials needed to complete construction. The continued impact of these disruptions and the ongoing extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward and developing strain mutations.

Recent Developments



Amendment Number 6 to Term Loan



On March 1, 2022, CH Capital Lending, LLC, which is an affiliate of our director Stuart Lichter (“CH Capital Lending”), purchased and acquired, as administrative agent and lender, pursuant to an Assignment of Loan and Loan Documents (the “Assignment of Loan and Loan Documents”) with Aquarian Credit Funding LLC (“Aquarian”), as existing administrative agent, and Investors Heritage Life Insurance Company (“IHLIC”), as existing lender, our $7.4 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and related loan documents under term loan agreement, dated as of December 1, 2020 (as amended, the “Term Loan Agreement”)..



On March 1, 2022, immediately after CH Capital Lending became the lender and administrative agent under the Term Loan Agreement, the Company entered into Amendment Number 6 to Term Loan Agreement (“Amendment Number 6”) by and among the Company, Newco, and certain of Newco’s subsidiaries, as borrowers, and CH Capital Lending, as administrative agent and lender. Under Amendment Number 6, the maturity date of the Term Loan was extended to March 31, 2024. Also under Amendment Number 6, the Term Loan was made convertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.50, subject to adjustment. The conversion price is subject to a weighted-average antidilution adjustment. Certain current and historical fees and expenses were added to the principal amount of the Term Loan.
