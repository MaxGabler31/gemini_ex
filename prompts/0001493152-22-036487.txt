ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a specialty coffee company and, we believe, a leading co-packer of single serve pour over coffee in the United States, as well as a preeminent co-packer of coffee brew bags, which is also referred to as tea-bag style coffee. In addition to our single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products, we have recently expanded our product portfolio to offer a third type of single serve coffee format, DRIPKIT pour over products, as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dripkit, Inc. (“Dripkit”). Our DRIPKIT pour over format features a large-size single serve pour over pack that sits on top of the cup and delivers in our view a barista-quality coffee experience to coffee drinkers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our mission is to leverage our position as a co-packer at the forefront of the North American single serve coffee market to revolutionize the way single serve coffee is enjoyed in the United States. While the United States is our core market, we also have manufacturing and sales operations in Korea and a joint venture in Latin America.
 
We believe we are the only commercial-scale producer within the North American market that has the dual capacity to pack both single serve pour over coffee and coffee brew bag coffee. We intend to leverage our position to become the commercial coffee manufacturer of choice and aim to become the preeminent leader for coffee companies seeking to enter into and grow within the single serve coffee market in North America. We are paid per-package based on the number of single serve coffee products produced by us. Accordingly, we consider our business model to be a form of tolling arrangement, as we receive a fee for almost every single serve coffee product our co-packing customers sell in the North American and Korean markets. While we financially benefit from the success of our co-packing customers through the sales of their respective single serve coffee products, we believe we are also able to avoid the risks associated with owning and managing the product and its related inventory.
 
We have also developed and sell NuZee branded single serve coffee products, including our flagship Coffee Blenders line of both single serve pour over coffee and coffee brew bags, which we believe offers consumers some of the best coffee available in a single serve application in the world.
 
We may also consider co-packaging other products that are complementary to our current product offerings and provide us with a deeper access to our customers. In addition, we are continually exploring potential strategic partnerships, co-ventures, and mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions with existing and future business partners to generate additional business, drive growth, reduce manufacturing costs, expand our product portfolio, enter into new markets, and further penetrate the markets in which we currently operate.
 
Single serve coffee products
 
Single serve pour over coffee
 
Single serve pour over coffee, or hand drip coffee, is a traditional and time-honored technique that pours hot water onto ground coffee with a prepacked coffee filter. Proponents of pour over coffee believe this method makes better coffee. Single serve pour over coffee uses the same brewing technique without a machine, with the coffee flowing straight into a cup using only hot water and the prepacked coffee filter.
 
Coffee brew bag coffee
 
We introduced our coffee brew bag, or tea-bag style coffee, in 2019. The brewing method is similar to brewing tea; put the coffee brew bag in a cup, add hot water and let it sit for approximately five minutes. This coffee brewing method is relatively new to North America and we believe has gained attention from roasters and end consumers who desire eco-friendlier alternatives to coffee pods and other types of single serve coffee. Our coffee brew bags are intended to be industrially compostable, allowing consumers to deposit the used coffee brew bag in the curbside compostable bins where available.

Revolutionizing the single serve coffee market in North America
 
We believe the typical coffee consumer is increasingly focused on the environmental impact of the product, as well as the taste and quality of the ingredients. We anticipate that pod-based, single serve coffee will face increasing pressure given their heavy reliance on the use of plastics. In our view, consumer preferences in North America have evolved over the last decade to substantially mirror those of Japanese consumers, who have traditionally focused on the taste, eco-footprint and quality of ingredients.
 
We believe that the saturation of coffee pods in the North American market, coupled with changing tastes, provides our single serve coffee products with a substantial market opportunity in North America. Accordingly, we believe there are opportunities for growth in the North American market for our single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products. Our single serve coffee products also have a number of advantages over other single serve coffee alternatives:
 

● | Our single serve coffee solutions are portable and do not require a machine for brewing. Therefore, the consumer investment required to enjoy our product is very minimal (as opposed to machine-based solutions). Single serve coffee products can easily travel and have a number of consume-later applications not available to machine-based solutions (camping, travel, office, etc.). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe our product offerings are more hygienic than other, machine-based single serve alternatives. For example, the use of a machine requires cleaning and maintenance. If not periodically cleaned or if spent pods are not removed timely, this can lead to poor taste and bacterial growth. 
● | Our single serve coffee products allow consumers to brew only what they need, therefore allowing mindful, responsible consumption that can reduce food and water waste and leads to better coffee sustainability. 

 
We seek to establish ourselves as the premier manufacturer of single serve coffee products for the North American market and to produce innovative coffee products that we believe will promote sustainability. We also seek to further expand our own brands of single serve coffee products for sale directly to end consumers in order to generate increased revenues and to help accelerate consumer adoption of these brewing formats. We believe that top tier brands that want to compete in the North American single serve coffee market will demand the highest levels of quality from their manufacturing partners. We further believe that we remain a commercial-scale leader in the single serve coffee market in North America as a result of our history of working with sophisticated packing equipment manufacturers, SQF Certification from the Safe Quality Food Institute, organic certification, our commitment to sustainability, operational knowledge and the co-packing arrangements we are continuing to develop with companies. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we feel we are well positioned to be a “go-to” coffee manufacturer for companies offering single serve coffee products in the North American market.
 
We understand that as single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products gain momentum in the North American market we will face increasing competition. However, (i) we have, and continue to develop, manufacturing expertise on increasingly complex and larger orders, (ii) we have experience dealing with companies of all sizes and their specific requirements (from small roasters to international companies) and (iii) we have SQF, organic and Kosher certification. We received SQF Certification from the Safe Quality Food Institute, which is a customary requirement to produce for large multi-national and international companies.
 
Our primary focus is the development of single serve coffee products in the North American market targeting the individual consumer for use at home and office or other settings that would benefit from single serve product offerings and positioning ourselves as the leading commercial-scale co-packer of single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products. We may also consider co-packaging other products that are complementary to our current single serve coffee product offerings and provide us with a deeper access to our customers.
 
Since 2016, we have been primarily focused on single serve pour over coffee production. Over this time, we have developed expertise in the operation of our sophisticated packing equipment and the related production of our single serve pour over coffee products at our manufacturing facilities. We have also expanded our co-packing expertise and product offerings to coffee brew bag coffee products, which we believe are gaining traction in the United States, as well as our DRIPKIT pour over products. Our goal is to continue to expand our product portfolio to raise our visibility, consumer awareness and brand profile.

Our sources of revenue
 
Co-packing
 
We operate as a third-party contract packager for the finished goods of other major companies operating in the coffee beverage industry. Under these arrangements, our co-packing customers typically supply us with roasted, whole bean coffee that we package into single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products according to their formulations and specifications. In addition, under our private label coffee development program, our team works directly with our co-packing customers in developing private labels of signature coffees. Under this program, our team of coffee experts works extensively with our co-packing customers to develop a coffee taste profile to their unique needs and then we source, roast (utilizing our third-party roasting or manufacturing partners), blend, pack (in either our traditional single serve pour over, DRIPKIT pour over or coffee brew bag coffee products), and package single serve coffee products to their exact specifications.
 
We currently focus on fostering co-packing arrangements with larger companies developing pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products, in addition to smaller scale, innovative companies that we believe are rapidly growing, as further described below. We believe that as our potential co-packing customers continue to realize that we have the experience co-packing for a variety of customer sizes, we will become the co-packer of choice. The standards required to co-pack for large international companies almost always meet or exceed the standards required to co-pack for any other customer. We also believe that as our co-packing customers’ competitors realize they have single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee solutions, they will be more motivated to develop their own such solutions and that will lead to increased co-packing opportunities for us.
 
In addition to larger companies, we package for smaller companies that we believe have significant growth potential. For example, we started packaging for a particular smaller company in 2017 and continue to do so today. This company started with smaller batch, single product offerings but over the years has meaningfully increased order sizes as well as the number of product offerings. We are continually looking for new and innovative companies with whom we may work and grow.
 
NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products
 
Although our primary focus is on the manufacture of single serve coffee products pursuant to co-packing arrangements with our co-packing clients, we have also developed high-quality NuZee branded single serve coffee products that, in addition to our DRIPKIT branded products, are sold directly to consumers. In addition to being available for direct sale to consumers, our NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products serve as samples that are provided to potential new co-packing customers to showcase our co-packing capabilities and production expertise.
 
Our NuZee branded products are from our perspective a ‘stepping-stone’ product for our co-packing customers that market high quality packaging and coffee. Sales of our NuZee branded products, including through Amazon, also help promote consumer adoption into the format and to educate coffee drinkers in the United States about this coffee format that is new to North America but widely known in East Asia. Our NuZee branded products are further described below.
 

● | Coffee Blenders. Our Coffee Blenders line of products, including both single serve pour over coffee products and coffee brew bag coffee, is a high-end product line that, in addition to showcasing our production expertise, also includes what we believe to be some of the best coffee available in a single serve application in the world. In addition, we have recently expanded our Coffee Blenders offerings to include a new Coldpresso latte product line that is available to purchase in Korea online. We sell Coffee Blenders products mainly online. We also have a number of potential co-packing opportunities in which our customers would contract for us to replicate one or more of our Coffee Blenders products with their film and packing, providing further evidence of the high-quality nature of this line and coffee.

● | Twin Peaks. We currently sell our Twin Peaks single serve pour over coffee exclusively via Amazon. This program commenced in 2019 and we expect that as Amazon and its customers become more familiar with single serve pour over coffee, we will increase our revenue for this product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our NuZee branded products, our premium DRIPKIT pour over format features a large-size single serve pour over pack that sits on top of the cup and delivers in our view a barista-quality coffee experience. We offer DRIPKIT pour over packs direct to consumers through our website, wholesale business-to-business to hospitality customers, and co-pack for coffee roasters.
 
Our business strategy
 
We intend to achieve our mission and further grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

● | Continually grow our base of large national or international co-packing customers. In furtherance of our goal to become the “go-to” commercial coffee manufacturer and preeminent partner for coffee companies seeking to enter into and grow within the single serve coffee market in North America, we focus on entering into co-packing agreements with large international companies, including co-packing arrangements pursuant to our private label coffee development program. We also intend to continue to educate and advocate for the development of pour over coffee products within the broader single serve category. We believe that, as the U.S. market continues to gain awareness of our traditional single serve pour over, DRIPKIT pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products, we will continue to grow our base of large domestic or international co-packing customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Co-pack for smaller scale, innovative coffee customers that we believe are rapidly growing and capture their growth over time. In addition to co-packing for large domestic or international customers, we believe that select smaller scale, rapidly growing, innovative co-packing customers provide us with different opportunities versus larger customers. Large national roasters often look to these smaller scale customers for inspiration. We believe capturing these influential roasters would help us provide format visibility to the bigger roasters as well as influential consumers. 
● | Efficiently grow our manufacturing footprint and capacity, including by leveraging new and current partnerships, in response to anticipated demand for co-packing. We intend to leverage our partnership announced in 2022 pursuant to which a manufacturing partner in Knoxville, Tennessee will provide us with additional manufacturing, coffee roasting and co-packing capabilities, and facilitate distribution efforts to the Eastern United States. With this partnership, we expect to offer a holistic coffee supply and manufacturing program to our existing and new customers, including coffee roasting and non-single serve coffee product co-packing in addition to our other single serve coffee formats. 
● | Strategically grow and expand our international operations that align with our vision. We plan to strategically grow our current international operations as well as potentially expand internationally if this growth or expansion is strategic to our vision. We believe the Korean market, albeit competitive, still has significant growth potential as well as strong market acceptance for coffee and single serve pour overs. We have also formed a joint venture in Latin America. As we look at other potential international manufacturing locations, we look for characteristics similar to the Korean, Latin American and U.S. markets. We plan to further leverage our international operations to support our customers’ expansion into the markets in which we operate. This includes assisting our U.S. customers launching their products in Korea and Mexico. 

Dripkit Transaction
 
On February 25, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Dripkit (the “Acquisition”) pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2022 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Dripkit, and Dripkit’s existing investors (the “Stock Recipients”) who executed joinders to the Asset Purchase Agreement as of the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the aggregate purchase price paid by us for the Acquisition was $860,000, consisting of cash paid by the Company to Dripkit and the Company’s issuance to the Stock Recipients of an aggregate of 178,681 shares of the Company’s common stock, plus the assumption of certain assumed liabilities, subject to certain adjustments and holdbacks as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

On May 2, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the bulk sales holdback amount was used to satisfy sales and use taxes owed by Dripkit to the State of New York as of the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the amounts remaining after offsetting the cost of these sales and use taxes were distributed as follows: (i) $39,237 was distributed to Dripkit on May 9, 2022, in connection with the cash bulk sales holdback amount, and (ii) 18,475 shares of our common stock were issued to the Stock Recipients on April 25, 2022, in connection with the stock bulk sales holdback amount.
 
For additional information regarding the Acquisition and the Asset Purchase Agreement, see “Note 6—Business Combinations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Dripkit operates as a new Dripkit Coffee business division that is wholly owned by NuZee, Inc.
 
Customers and Sales
 
Our co-packing customers primarily include large and small size coffee roasters and food service companies. We intend to continue to pursue such co-packing arrangements in the future. We believe this customer interest is primarily due to (i) the saturation of machine based single serve coffee alternatives, (ii) increase in consumer requirements for eco-friendly packaging and (iii) our superior taste quality compared to other single serve coffee alternatives.
 
Sales to relatively few co-packing customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales, and our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with these key co-packing customers and other key retail and grocery customers. One major customer accounted for approximately 28% and 32% of our total revenue in the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as further described in “Note 2—Basis of Presentation And Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Major Customers” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Generally, under our co-packing arrangements as well as our fulfillment of purchase orders for the distribution of NuZee branded products through nationally recognized retailers, customers must issue purchase orders for our products and co-packing services. Although these purchase orders stipulate key terms including order quantity, product specifications, price, payment terms, packaging method and delivery instructions, our co-packing arrangements and our arrangements with nationally recognized retailers are typically not governed by any written agreement and have no ongoing minimum purchase requirements; however, we do impose minimum quantity requirements when an order is placed.
 
We also sell our NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products directly to consumers. Currently, Amazon and our Coffee Blenders website are our only established domestic retail channels for direct sales to consumers of NuZee branded products, and our DRIPKIT products are sold through our Dripkit website and third-party online retailers.
 
Manufacturing and Operational Capacity
 
We currently lease manufacturing facilities in Vista, California and Seoul, Korea to produce our single serve pour over or coffee brew bag coffee products. In November 2021, we entered into a new lease in Seoul, Korea for a larger office and manufacturing space. In 2022, we expanded our office and manufacturing space in Vista, California by approximately 2,000 square feet and also extended our current lease through March 2025 and our sub-leased property through January 2023.
 
As a result of our capital investments since 2015, including our acquisition of packing equipment from manufacturers whom we believe are the global leaders for supplying such machines, we presently have the annual capacity to produce up to 150 million single serve coffee products (pour over or coffee brew bags) at our two manufacturing facilities, which we believe is sufficient to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing requirements. In addition, in May 2022, we announced a new partnership pursuant to which a manufacturing partner in Knoxville, Tennessee has agreed to provide us with additional manufacturing, coffee roasting and co-packing capabilities, and facilitate distribution efforts to the Eastern United States. In connection with the foregoing operational developments, and following our strategic analysis of our current and anticipated facility requirements, we have determined to transition our manufacturing operations away from the facility we previously operated in Plano, Texas. Our executive office and administrative operations are now located in Richardson, Texas.

We own high-quality and sophisticated packing equipment developed by premier East Asian suppliers for pour over and coffee brew bag coffee production. We believe these manufacturers are the world leaders for supplying such machines. Nitrogen and air compression machinery is capable of handling expansion, which helps to minimize any ongoing related capital expenditures for such machinery as we expand.
 
Raw Materials
 
Under our co-packing arrangements, our co-packing customers typically supply us with roasted, whole bean coffee that we then produce and package into single serve pour over and coffee brew bag coffee products according to their formulations and specifications. In addition, in connection with the production of our NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products and specialty coffees that we have developed for co-packing customers under our private label coffee development program, we source and purchase green coffee from multiple green coffee suppliers, and from multiple regions around the world. After being sourced by us, the green coffee is then shipped to our roasting or manufacturing partners where the coffee is roasted and then shipped to us for grinding, blending, packing, and packaging. Maintaining a steady supply of roasted coffee beans from our co-packing customers is essential to our co-packing arrangements, and securing an adequate supply of green coffee is essential to our ability to manufacture NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products and to support the development of private labels for our co-packing customers under our private label development program. We have arrangements based on purchase orders in place with suppliers and partners for all components required to provide our co-packing services and deliver our NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products.
 
Our principal packaging materials include filters, foils, cartons, and craft master cases. We conduct business with multiple vendors of packaging materials on a purchase order basis.
 
Distribution
 
For distribution of our single serve coffee products to our co-packing customers, we typically rely on the distribution networks of our co-packing customers, including freight companies and common carriers arranged by them. At the request of our co-packing customers, we may also utilize a freight broker for the distribution and delivery of our products according to our co-packing customers’ instructions. Our NuZee and DRIPKIT branded products are typically delivered by common carriers directly to each customer. Our manufacturing partner in Knoxville, Tennessee facilitates distribution of certain of our products to the Eastern United States.
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks
 
We currently own the following United States trademarks: “NuZee”, “NuZee Coffee (Stylized)”, “NuZee Coffee and Design”, “Coffee Blenders”, “Twin Peaks”, “Active Cup”, “Relax Cup”, “Think Cup”, “Nude Cup”, “Pine Ranch Coffee”, and “Dripkit”. We are also in the process of obtaining rights to the “It’s Coffee Reimagined” and “Dripkit and Design” trademarks. We intend to continue growing our trademark portfolio in the United States with other related slogans and brands as new products are launched.
 
We further intend to expand our brand protections outside of the United States in line with our prospective international growth. As of the date of this Report, we had registered trademarks “Coffee Blenders” and “Twin Peaks” in Japan and registered trademarks “Twin Peaks” in Korea. We have also filed for “NuZee”, “NuZee Coffee (Stylized)”, “NuZee Coffee and Design”, in Canada, Japan, Korea, and Mexico; “Dripkit (Words only)” and Design in Japan, Mexico, and Korea; and “Dripkit and Design” in Canada, Japan, and Korea.
 
Patents
 
We currently own the following patents relating to our DRIPKIT pour over product: (1) a U.S. design patent that protects the visual ornamental characteristics associated with the DRIPKIT pour over coffee apparatus design, which expires in November 2035; (2) a U.S. utility patent that covers utility patent features of the DRIPKIT portable drip apparatus, which expires in July 2038; and (3) one pending utility patent application that is a continuation patent application for pursuing broader/different utility patent features for the DRIPKIT portable drip apparatus, which is currently pending and awaiting examination. Patent rights (1) and (2) stem from the Acquisition of Dripkit in 2022.

We intend to aggressively protect, police and assert our intellectual property rights, including product designs, proprietary product research and concepts as well as our trademark portfolio. Although asserting our rights may result in a substantial cost to the Company, our management strongly believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.
 
International operations
 
Korea
 
We established our Korean subsidiary in 2018. We are one of many producers of single serve pour over coffee products in Korea and do not have any exclusive rights for this region. Our strategy is to leverage our local relationships to secure large co-packing agreements for the markets in Korea, China and other Asian countries. Our Korean subsidiary increased its customer base in our 2022 fiscal year, and we believe that it will be able to continue to secure meaningful co-packing customers in our 2023 fiscal year.
Latin America
 
In January 2020, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Industrias Marino, S.A. de C.V., a company incorporated under the laws of Mexico (“El Marino”), to form a joint venture in Mexico between us and El Marino in Mexico (“NuZee Latin America”). NuZee Latin America is organized under the laws of Mexico. To date, the only activities in NuZee Latin America were the contribution of two machines, and start up and initial marketing and sales activities. Its primary business operations are intended to consist of the manufacture of single serve coffee products for sale in Mexico, Central and South America.
Competition
 
Prior to the success of coffee pods within the last two decades, coffee was primarily consumed at home and via traditional pot-based drip brewers and, to a lesser extent, instant coffee. Pot-based brewers are typically known for good quality coffee that produces multiple cups but are not well-suited for single serve alternatives. In recent years with the advent of coffee pods and increased coffee consumption outside the home, the North American market has been focused on speed and convenience. Coffee pods addressed the need for a single serve coffee solution that was viewed as superior to instant coffee. As coffee consumption has also moved outside the home in recent years, consumer preferences have also changed, leading to greater demand for higher quality coffee alternatives.
 
The beverage industry in general, and the coffee sector, is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include product, quality, convenience, price, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our Coffee Blenders, DRIPKIT and other NuZee branded products are competing directly with Green Mountain brands and other licensed brands, as well as third-parties in the single serve coffee category who have similar formats to our products. Green Mountain brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national distribution through well-funded advertising, and product awareness. Our Coffee Blenders, DRIPKIT and other NuZee branded products also compete generally with all hot liquid refreshments, including specialty coffees and teas. Companies and brands manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do.
 
Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include functional delivery of our products and co-packing services, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique functions in new and various packaging formats, attractive and unique promotions, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of the distribution networks on which we rely.
 
We also compete to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets and search placement in online stores.
