ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Rito Group Corp., a Nevada corporation (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 24, 2015.
 
Rito Group Corp is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International Limited, a Company organized under the laws of the British Colony, Anguilla. It should be noted that our wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International Limited. owns 100% of Rito International Enterprise Company Limited, a Hong Kong Company, and Rito International Enterprise Company Limited owns 100% of 深圳市汇图贸易有限公司, a Company organized in Shenzhen, China.
 
At this time, we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary and share the same business plan of our subsidiary which is the sale of miscellaneous retail goods. Sino Union International Limited also shares the same business plan of Rito International Enterprise Company Limited and 深圳市汇图贸易有限公司.
 
We are a development stage Company. Thus far the Company has been actively searching for companies that may be interested in listing their own products for sale on our “Rito Online Mall”, which is now still at the designing stage and is believed to be launched once the development is finalized. The Rito Online Mall provides a platform for merchants and customers to facilitate transactions and take advantage of the growth opportunity we have identified in Hong Kong’s E-Commerce Industry.
 
The products Rito Online mall tends to include are deep-processed food, cleansing and skin care products, brown rice drink, natural spring water, Dendrobium Candidum, cookware, and numerous other products that we feel will be highly marketable to the population of Hong Kong in particular. Given the ever increasing competitive market we plan to operate in, Rito Group Corp feels that by utilizing the emerging E-Commerce business model known as Online to Offline (O2O) to give us a strategic advantage based around the shopping patterns of the average Hong Kong citizen.
 
Rito Online Mall plans to feature products from many different retailers, disclosed in greater detail below. In order to generate revenue from the Rito Online Mall all of our members are required to pay a base membership fee. In order to list on our website vendors do not need to pay a membership or listing fee. And our members serve as our sales force and assist in selling the products listed by vendors on the Rito Online Mall. For members successful in selling products on the mall, they will have their names entered in as a reference and they will receive a commission on the sale of products. The membership fees and commissions have not been determined yet, and will be evaluated and implemented as our business continues to develop.
 
Store-based retailing remains the preferred channel for most consumers in Hong Kong. This is possibly motivated by the sheer abundance of chain and independent retailers conveniently located around Hong Kong. In addition, within Hong Kong a significant part of the culture is to go from store to store and purchase goods as opposed to ordering them online. Citizens prefer to go to the store to look at goods versus simply ordering them online, order and wait. By finding what they are looking for on our online mall and being given the option to go to our physical location to view our display products (which will be identical to those offered at the store, but for display purposes only and not for sale) and have a look of them before they order this will cater to the growing internet usage of the region while also keeping an important aspect of the culture intact.
 
We currently have five physical locations which has displayed pieces of the items available on our platform for consumers to look at and test prior to purchasing the products online. We have leased five retail stores in total. Two of them located in Hong Kong (Sheung Shui and Lai Chi Kok) and the other three are in mainland China (Shenzhen, Dongguan and Qingyuan). The target demographic for this marketing strategy is primarily middle-class individuals of all ages who want to improve their quality of life. To that end the online shop will mainly list high quality products with international brand recognition. In the future, Rito plans to open numerous showrooms in Asia, not strictly limited to Hong Kong, so that we can reach an even larger market should our initial model within Hong Kong prove to be as successful as we project.
 
O2O Commerce
 
O2O Platform provides a platform for customers to shop all of our products online. When customers order the products online, we will deliver the product to their address directly. This platform “Rito Online Mall” is also planned to be installed in over 100,000 shopping kiosks in the coming 3 years. The kiosks will be located in different shopping malls and restaurants in China. As the number of kiosks increase, the number of customers that we can reach will also be increased.

In the meantime, before this management system is finalized, the Company tends to use an existing payment method, which is Paypal, to help facilitate online business transactions payment. Nevertheless, “U 惠-CRM U-Hui-CRM” is still owned by the Company and will be used once this management system is finalized and ready for operation.

AgriGaia Biomimicry Farming System
 
Products: deep-processed food, cleansing and skin care products
 
AgriGaia Biomimicry Farming System is invented by Professor Yang Hao in 1990 in Taiwan, by mimicking the concept of rainforest’s circulation. Most of the nutrition needed for plant growth comes from the soil, it provides different kinds of minerals to the plants. Moreover, this system is an innovative agricultural biotechnology, which uses beneficial microorganisms, to apply with natural materials. Thus, the self-made natural bio-nutrition liquid provide different nutrition for crops grow.
 
The System mimics rainforest’s circulation concept by reversing the effect of leaching. Through vaporization, substances underground are easily brought to the surface and decomposed. The soil keeps being activated by fresh air and water. Air, water, and nutrition inside soil remain sufficient like a rainforest. By using underground pipelines, the System provides needed nutrition to maintain fertile soil.
 
With the use of the System, we are capable of planting different crops, vegetables, fruits, and even Chinese medicine. Combined with 30 year’s plantation techniques, Professor Yang has cooperated with various manufacturers to produce over 300 kinds of deep-processed food, cleansing and skin care products such as Chinese medicine enzyme, green tea sugar, shampoo, bath gel, and so on.
 
The most needed energy source for human body is food. The most energy within food comes from the land. With a passionate heart, we learn from nature. Aiming to restore polluted lands to its original state of vitality.
 
In order to pursue ever-lasting vitality and sustain lives on this land, we have undergone countless researches and attempts. We innovate a farming system that can help to heal the land. Not only does it absorb energy from nature, it unceasingly adds vitality to nature. It enables us to see how strong and abundant nature is. Through the most authentic food it produces, it also delivers the real taste from nature.
 
We hope everyone on earth can acknowledge, eat, and use truly healthy products. Consequently, human beings can reach the lifestyle of “take from nature, return to nature” and live peacefully with all creatures.

Competition
 
E-commerce for location based, entertainment and lifestyle service providers has begun to grow rapidly around the world. The e-commerce service providers can be categorized into two sectors. One sector consists of self-operated vendors modeled after Amazon and Groupon, including jd.com, meituan.com and the group buy channel of dianping.com. The second sector consists of third-party platform operators such tmall.com, which focuses on facilitating the sales of goods.
 
Our competitors also include industry, or content-specific, vertical websites whose information serves the same underlying industries as some of the products that are listed on our online Mall. We may also face competition from major internet companies who may enter into the e-commerce for local services industry. Any internet companies may compete with us for the any potential vendors who plan to sell their products on online platform.
 
We believe that the E-commerce industry will continue to experience technical upgrades, evolution in market standards, changes in the needs of merchants and continuous innovation. Our ability to maintain our position and market share depends on many factors, such as: the quality of goods and services on the Rito Online mall, our customer satisfaction, our ability to expand our customer base, the number of products and merchants we can attract to our online mall, our reputation and brand recognition compared to our competitors and the continued growth of Hong Kong’s economy.
