The following table presents selected information concerning our casino resort properties as of December 31, 2017:

Property | AcquisitionDate | Location | SlotMachines | TableGames | HotelRooms
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel | 2012 | Hancock County, MS (near New Orleans) | 931 | 28 | 129 
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel | 2016 | Cripple Creek, CO (near Colorado Springs) | 798 | 11 | 24

Grand Lodge Casino (leased and part of the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino) | 2011 | Incline Village, NV (North Shore of Lake Tahoe) | 264 | 15 | * 


* | We have agreements with Hyatt for exclusive usage of certain hotel rooms and suites, and access to additional rooms, other amenities and services to cater to our customers and support our operations. The Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino has approximately 422 guest rooms.

We manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States.  Accordingly, Stockman’s Casino and Grand Lodge Casino comprise a Northern Nevada business segment, while Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel, Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel, and Rising Star Casino Resort are currently distinct segments.  Our corporate headquarters are in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Our revenues are primarily derived from gaming sources, which include revenues from slot machines, table games and keno. Play at our slot machines accounts for most of our revenues, but we also offer a wide range of table games. We set minimum and maximum betting limits for our slot machines and table games based on market conditions, customer demand and other factors. Our gaming revenues are derived from a broad base of guests that includes both high- and low-stakes players. We also derive a significant amount of revenues from our hotel rooms, food and beverage outlets, retail outlets, entertainment and our golf course at the Rising Star Casino Resort. Our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. Additionally, our operating results may be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our guests, weather conditions affecting access to our properties, achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies, taxation and other regulatory changes, and competitive factors, including but not limited to, additions and improvements to the competitive supply of gaming facilities. We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages, and other factors. 
Our mission is to maximize shareholder value. We seek to increase revenues by providing our customers with their favorite games and amenities, high-quality customer service, and appropriate customer loyalty programs. Our customers include nearby residents who represent a high potential for repeat visits, along with drive-in tourist patrons. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. The casino resort industry is capital-intensive, and we rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance capital expenditures. We also assess the potential impact of growth and development opportunities, including capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties. 
All of our casino properties are operated by us 24 hours each day, every day of the year.  We also operate the hotel and food and beverage operations at Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy's, Rising Star and Stockman's. At the Grand Lodge Casino, Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino ("Hyatt Lake Tahoe") manages the hotel and food and beverage outlets.

Operating Properties

Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel

  The Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel ("Silver Slipper") is situated on the west end of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and includes approximately 37,000 square feet of gaming space, 129 hotel rooms, a fine-dining restaurant, a buffet, a quick-service restaurant, an oyster bar and a casino bar. The property sits at the western end of an approximately eight-mile-long white sand beach, the closest such beach to the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. Its customers are primarily from communities in southern Louisiana, including the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas, and southwestern Mississippi. The Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel currently generates the most revenue and operating income of any of our properties.
The primary lease for the Silver Slipper includes approximately 38 acres, consisting of the seven-acre parcel on which the casino and hotel is situated and approximately 31 acres of marshlands. The lease term ends in April 2058. Between February 2019 and October 2027, we have the option to purchase the land site. Management believes that it will be economically favorable to exercise the buyout option and intends to do so, subject to our financial resources and future capital market conditions. During the third quarter of 2017, we opened our new swimming pool and beach complex and made certain improvements to traffic patterns and landscaping around the front of the property. We also opened a new 18-seat oyster bar in the casino in mid-2017. 
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel ("Bronco Billy's") occupies a significant portion of the key city block of Cripple Creek’s “casino strip” and contains approximately 17,000 square feet of gaming space, 24 hotel rooms, a steakhouse and four casual dining outlets. Bronco Billy's also leases certain parking lots and buildings, including a portion of the hotel and casino, under a long-term lease. The lease has six renewal options in three-year increments to 2035 and we have the right to buy out the lease at any time during its term. Bronco Billy's customers are primarily from the Colorado Springs/Pueblo/Cañon City metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in Colorado, with a population of approximately 900,000. Cripple Creek is approximately a one-hour drive from Colorado Springs, as well as a two-hour drive from the Denver metropolitan area, which has a population of approximately four million people.

During 2017, we acquired land and options to purchase or lease land and buildings, including the freestanding and closed Imperial Casino; the operating historic Imperial Hotel, which offers 12 refurbished guest rooms; and approximately four acres of vacant or underutilized land. We intend to develop a high-quality hotel and other amenities at this property and are considering reopening the Imperial Casino as a part of the proposed expansion. 
Rising Star Casino Resort

Rising Star Casino Resort ("Rising Star") is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Rising Star offers approximately 40,000 square feet of casino space, a contiguous 190-room hotel, an adjacent leased 104-room hotel, five dining outlets and an 18-hole golf course. The 104-room hotel is leased pursuant to a capital lease agreement that expires in 2027 and contains a bargain purchase option. During recent years, this property was adversely affected by the legalization of gaming in Ohio, where several new competitors are now located. All of such potential casinos in Ohio are now open.
During the third quarter of 2017, we opened our newly constructed 56-space RV Park. We are also making significant improvements to the Rising Star facilities expected to be completed during 2018, including renovation of the entry pavilion and other sense-of-arrival improvements. We are also in the process of developing a 10-car ferry boat service across the river to Kentucky, which will significantly shorten the distance for customers traveling from Kentucky to Rising Star. We have received a conditional use permit from the Boone County Board of Adjustment for a ferry landing on land that we own in Kentucky, and have acquired a new pushtug and specially-designed barge for the ferry operations. Commencement of ferry boat operations remains subject to additional approvals, including, but not limited to, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard. We hope to receive such approvals in time to construct the necessary roads and ramps and commence the ferry boat operations prior to the peak summer season of 2018.
Under Indiana regulations, we are allowed to have significantly greater casino gaming capacity than we utilize today. We have been exploring the possibility of relocating this excess gaming capacity to another location in Indiana. This would require legislative approval and there is no certainty that such approval will be received or, even if any proposed legislation were to become law, that the Company would be successful in developing a new gaming, lodging and entertainment facility.
6

In January 2017, State Senator Ford of Terre Haute, Indiana introduced legislation that would allow us to relocate half of our permitted gaming capacity to a new casino to be developed in Terre Haute. Such development requires approval of both houses of the state legislature and the approval or acquiescence of the governor. On February 16, 2017, the Public Policy Committee of the Indiana State Senate voted 5-5 on Senator Ford's bill; it required a majority vote to proceed to the Senate floor. The Indiana legislature meets annually, but the sessions in even-numbered years are shorter in duration and designed to primarily address immediate fiscal issues. We expect to continue to pursue our proposal to relocate part of our gaming capacity in the 2019 legislature.

Northern Nevada 

Stockman’s Casino

Stockman’s Casino is located approximately one hour from Reno, Nevada and includes approximately 8,400 square feet of gaming space. The facility has a bar, a fine-dining restaurant and a coffee shop. Stockman's primarily serves the local market of Fallon and surrounding areas, including the nearby Naval Air Station Fallon, the United States Navy's premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility, informally referred to as the "Top Gun" school.
During 2016 and 2017, we began improving the property's exterior, including a new parking lot for ease of access, landscaping and a digital marquee. During the first quarter of 2018, we completed a new porte cochère at the property. 
Grand Lodge Casino

We operate the Grand Lodge Casino at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe under a lease with Hyatt Equities, L.L.C. ("Hyatt"). The Grand Lodge Casino is located within the Hyatt Lake Tahoe in Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe and includes approximately 18,900 square feet of casino space.  The Hyatt Lake Tahoe is one of three AAA Four Diamond hotels in the Lake Tahoe area and all of northern Nevada. Its customers consist of both locals and tourists visiting the Lake Tahoe area.
  In November 2015, the lease was amended to extend our relationship and refurbish and improve the casino facility. The amendment included (i) an agreement for Hyatt to renovate the casino up to a maximum cost of $3.5 million and for us to purchase up to $1.5 million of new gaming devices, equipment or other capital expenditures, and (ii) an increase in monthly rent from $125,000 to $145,833 commencing on July 1, 2017, and $166,667 commencing on January 1, 2018. Together with Hyatt, we completed the refurbishment during the second quarter of 2017.
The amendment also extended the term of the lease to August 31, 2023 and deferred Hyatt's option to purchase our leasehold interest and related operating assets to January 1, 2019.

Government Regulation

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations and include, without limitation, the following conditions and restrictions:

• | Periodic license fees and taxes must be paid to state and local gaming authorities;


• | Certain officers, directors, key employees, and gaming employees are required to be licensed or otherwise approved by the gaming authorities;


• | Individuals who must be approved by a gaming authority must submit comprehensive personal disclosure forms and undergo an exhaustive background investigation, the costs for which must be borne by the applicant;


• | Changes in any licensed or approved individuals must be reported to and/or approved by the relevant gaming authority;


• | Failure to timely file the required application forms by any individual required to be approved by the relevant gaming authority may result in that individual’s denial and the gaming licensee may be required by the gaming authority to disassociate with that individual; and


• | If any individual is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, the gaming licensee is required to disassociate with that individual.

Violations of gaming laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A summary of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See "Item 1A - Risk Factors" for additional discussion.
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our Indiana property is subject to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for its riverboat and golf club operations, and our Mississippi property is located near environmental wetlands. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, and may also incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent the property. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.
Competition

The gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities with which we compete include traditional commercial casinos and casino resorts in various states including on tribal lands and at racetracks, riverboat and dockside gaming, state-sponsored lotteries, video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels, pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog racing and jai alai, sports betting and card rooms.  Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. All of our casinos, as well as other casinos that we may develop or acquire, compete with all these forms of gaming.  We also will compete with any new forms or jurisdictions of gaming that may be legalized, as well as with other types of entertainment. Some of our 
8

competitors have more personnel and greater financial or other resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are: location, with casinos located closer to their feeder markets at an advantage; casino, lodging, entertainment and other hospitality product quality in terms of facilities, customer service and ease of access; breadth of offerings, including the types of casino games and other non-gaming amenities; and marketing, including the amount and frequency of promotions offered to guests.
 
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel

Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel is the western-most casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and competes with several larger casinos located nearby in Hancock County and Gulfport, Mississippi, one of which is currently expanding. It also competes with casinos in Biloxi, Mississippi and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Biloxi is one hour east of the Silver Slipper along Interstate 10. New Orleans and Baton Rouge are one and two hours, respectively, west of Silver Slipper.
Silver Slipper is the closest casino to most of St. Tammany Parish, one of the most affluent and fastest-growing parishes in Louisiana. Louisiana law permits 15 riverboat casinos, one land-based casino, four casinos at racetracks, and in certain areas, a limited number of slot machines at qualifying truck stops. The legislation permitting riverboat and truck stop casinos requires a local referendum and, at the time such legalization occurred, it was rejected by St. Tammany Parish voters. At this time, all licenses for riverboat casinos in Louisiana have been granted and are in operation, though it is possible for an existing licensee to relocate its casino (subject to state laws and approval in a local referendum). Mississippi, which has lower gaming tax rates than Louisiana, does not have a limitation on the number of casino licenses, but requires casinos in certain southern counties to be within approximately 800 feet of the shoreline, as defined by state law. There are occasionally proposals to relocate casinos within Louisiana or to develop new casinos in Mississippi, but there are considerable political and economic constraints on such potential competition and management does not believe such efforts will be successful in the foreseeable future.
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel
Bronco Billy's is located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is a historic gold mining town located approximately one hour southwest of Colorado Springs, on the west side of Pikes Peak. Cripple Creek receives an estimated 1.5 million visitors per year and is one of only three cities in Colorado where commercial gaming is permitted. The other two cities are near Denver. Additionally, two Native American gaming operations exist in southwestern Colorado and there are tribal casinos in Oklahoma, but these are much further from Colorado Springs than Cripple Creek. As of December 31, 2017, we believe that Bronco Billy's was the second largest of the seven gaming facilities operating in Cripple Creek. Gaming in Colorado is “limited stakes,” which restricts any single wager to a current maximum of $100.
Rising Star Casino Resort

The Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun, Indiana is one of three riverboat casinos located on the Ohio River in southeastern Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Its closest competitors are each approximately 15 miles away, near bridges crossing the Ohio River. There is no bridge at Rising Star, but we intend to commence ferry boat service connecting Rising Sun, Indiana, to the more populous Northern Kentucky region. Rising Star also competes with casinos in Ohio; a casino-resort in French Lick, Indiana; and two racetrack casinos near Indianapolis, Indiana.
A Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 2014 may permit a horse racing track in northern Kentucky to install slot machine-like devices, although it has not yet done so. The Indiana legislature passed legislation in 2015 to allow table games at racetracks (which are currently limited to slot machines) beginning March 2021.
Northern Nevada
Stockman’s Casino

Stockman’s Casino is the largest of several casinos in Churchill County, which has a population of approximately 25,000. Churchill County is also home of the Naval Air Station Fallon, the United States Navy's premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility and home of the "Top Gun" school. While we are not aware of any significant planned expansion to gaming capacity in the Churchill County area, additional competition may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, while the Navy appears to be currently expanding its base in Fallon, a reduction of its activities at the base would likely have an adverse effect on Stockman's results of operations. Fallon is approximately 30 minutes east of the new large Tesla battery factory and other developments in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. 
Grand Lodge Casino
9


Grand Lodge Casino is one of four casinos located within a five-mile radius in the North Lake Tahoe area.  A fifth casino, which has been closed for several years, was sold out of bankruptcy during 2017 and may re-open in the near future. 

Grand Lodge Casino also competes with casinos in South Lake Tahoe and Reno.  There are also numerous Native American casinos in California serving the Northern California market.
Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our customer loyalty programs and specialized marketing campaigns, such as our seasonal "Christmas Casino" event at the Rising Star Casino Resort. We advertise through various channels, including radio, television, internet, billboards, newspapers and magazines, direct mail, email and social media.  We also maintain websites to inform customers about our properties and utilize social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals.  Our customer loyalty programs include the Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, Bronco Billy’s MVP “Most Valuable Players” Club, the Rising Star Rewards Club™, the Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club® and the Stockman’s Winner’s Club.  Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays. 
Our properties do not have coordinated loyalty programs. We do not currently believe that it would be economically advantageous given the disparate locations of our properties. Instead, our loyalty programs focus on providing each casino's customers the amenities they most prefer.
Employees

As of March 1, 2018, we had 13 full-time corporate employees, three of whom are executive officers and two additional senior management employees. Our casino properties had 1,336 full-time and 330 part-time employees as follows:

 | Full-time | Part-time
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel | 473 | | 92 
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel | 271 | | 64 
Rising Star Casino Resort | 419 | | 132
Grand Lodge Casino | 95 | | 35 
Stockman’s Casino | 78 | | 7 


We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions.
