Item 1. | Business

Overview
Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and reductions in associated costs. By implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry’s integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products fall into three product groups: embedded modules, pluggable modules and semiconductors. Our embedded module and pluggable module product groups consist of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 1,200 gigabits per second, or Gbps, for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. Our semiconductor product group consists of our low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and our silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which are either integrated into our embedded and pluggable modules or sold to customers on a standalone basis for integration into internally developed or other merchant modules. We are also developing a 400ZR module that will expand our pluggable module product group, and enable inter-data center transmission capacity of 400 Gbps in the same compact pluggable form factors used for 400G client optics, including QSFP-DD and OSFP. Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers’ network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.
Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS, capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance and density, and reduce costs. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.
Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic design and integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.
We sell our products through a direct sales force to leading network equipment manufacturers, network operators and cloud service providers. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $339.9 million, $385.2 million and $478.4 million, respectively. Our net income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $4.9 million, $38.5 million and $131.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total assets were $601.9 million, $611.3 million and $516.9 million, respectively.
Industry Background
Growing Demand for Bandwidth and Network Capacity
Global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic is projected to more than triple from 4.1 exabytes per day in 2017 to 13.2 exabytes per day in 2022, representing a projected 26% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, according to Cisco’s Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Trends, 2017-2022, dated November 2018, or the VNI Report. This projected rapid growth in IP traffic is the result of several factors, including:

• | Increased data and video consumption. Over the last decade, the proliferation of new technologies, applications, Web 2.0-based services and Internet-connected devices has led to increasing levels of Internet traffic and congestion and the need for greater bandwidth. Video traffic, in particular, is growing rapidly, and placing significant strains on network capacity. The VNI Report estimates that by 2022, video traffic will represent 82% of all global consumer IP traffic, forecast to be 293 exabytes per month in 2022, up from 77 exabytes per month in 2017. According to the 

2

VNI Report, from 2017 to 2022, video traffic and all global consumer IP traffic are expected to increase by projected 34% and 31% CAGRs, respectively.

• | Growth in mobile and 4G/LTE/5G communications. The increasing demand for data- and video-intensive content and applications on mobile devices is driving significant growth in mobile data and video traffic and has led to the proliferation of advanced wireless communication technologies, such as 4G/LTE, which depend on wired networks to function. Next generation 5G network build-outs anticipated over the next few years will drive the need for higher capacity optical interfaces in backhaul and metro networks. According to the VNI Report, global mobile data traffic is expected to increase nearly seven-fold from 2017 to 2022, a projected 46% CAGR, reaching 77.5 exabytes per month by 2022. 


• | Proliferation of cloud services. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud services to reduce IT costs and enable more flexible operating models. Consumers are increasingly relying on cloud services to satisfy video, audio and photo storage and sharing needs. Together, these factors are driving increased Internet traffic as cloud services are accessed and used. According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, dated November 2018, or the GCI Report, global cloud data center traffic is expected to reach 19.5 zettabytes, or ZB, per year by 2021, up from 6.0 ZB per year in 2016, a projected 27% CAGR, and to represent 95% of total data center traffic by 2021, compared to 88% in 2016. 


• | Changing traffic patterns. Content service providers and data center operators are increasingly building their own networks of connected data centers to handle the increasing amounts of data generated by today’s modern applications that require more complex processing. The architectures of these connected data centers dramatically increase the amount of data being transmitted within these data center networks. For example, virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri require significant processing in the cloud. As a result, the East-West, or E-W, traffic created in response to processing these incoming requests are expected to be greater than the North-South, or N-S, network utilization. As indicated by the GCI Report, it is estimated that by 2021, enterprises will move from an 85/15 mix of N-S/E-W traffic to a 15/85 mix with greater than five times more E-W traffic than that between the servers and the requesting devices, such as desktops, mobile devices and IoT devices, among others. 


• | Adoption of the “Internet of Things.” Significant consumer, enterprise and governmental adoption of the “Internet of Things,” which refers to the global network of Internet-connected devices embedded with electronics, software and sensors, is anticipated to strain network capacity further and increase demand for bandwidth. The VNI Report estimates that globally, there will be approximately 28.5 billion networked devices in 2022, up from 18 billion such devices in 2017. 

Importance of Optical Interconnect Technologies
Optical equipment that interfaces directly with fiber relies on optical interconnect technologies that take digital signals from network equipment, perform signal processing to convert the digital signals to optical signals for transmission over the fiber network, and then perform the reverse functions on the receive side. These technologies also incorporate advanced signal processing that can monitor, manage and reduce errors and signal impairment in the fiber connection between the transmit and receive sides. Advanced optical interconnect technologies can enhance network performance by improving the capabilities and increasing the capacities of optical equipment and routers and switches, while also reducing operating costs.
The key characteristics of advanced optical interconnect technologies that dictate performance and capacity include:

• | Speed. Speed refers to the rate at which information can be transmitted over an optical channel and is measured in Gbps. 


• | Density. Density refers to the physical footprint of the optical interconnect technology. Density is primarily a function of the size and power consumption of the technology. 


• | Robustness. Robustness refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to compensate for the signal impairment that accumulates through the fiber network and prevent and correct errors introduced by the network. 


• | Power Consumption. Power consumption refers to the amount of electricity an optical interconnect technology consumes. Lower power consumption permits improved density and product reliability, and results in lower operating expense for electricity and cooling. 


• | Automation. Automation refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to handle network tasks that historically were required to be performed manually, such as activation and channel provisioning. 


• | Manageability. Manageability refers to the ability of an optical interconnect technology to monitor network performance and detect and address network issues easily and efficiently, which helps increase reliability and reduce ongoing maintenance and operational needs. 

3

As they build their network service offerings, cloud and service providers and network equipment manufacturers weigh these characteristics differently based on the particular demands and challenges they face. For example, cloud or service providers operating long-haul networks that transmit large amounts of data between Boston and San Francisco have relatively few connection points in their networks and may be more sensitive to speed and manageability of the optical interconnect technology and less focused on power consumption. In contrast, metro network operators or cloud or service providers operating inter-city or intra-city networks may face space and power constraints, as well as constantly changing workload needs, and be most focused on density, power consumption and automation.
Improvements in these characteristics can lead to reductions in development costs for network equipment manufacturers, who might otherwise need to develop their own optical interconnect technologies. In addition, improvements in these characteristics can lead to reductions in acquisition and development costs for network equipment manufacturers who incorporate third-party optical interconnect technologies into their equipment, which in turn can reduce capital costs for cloud and service providers. Further, improvements in power consumption, automation and manageability can result in reduced operating costs for cloud and service providers.
Coherent Interconnect Technologies
Traditional techniques for transmitting information via light signals over a fiber optic network used simple “on/off” manipulation, or modulation, of the light signal. These traditional techniques are adequate for transmission speeds up to 10 Gbps, as separate optical equipment can be used to monitor the fiber connection and to compensate for the degradation of the light signals when they travel through the fiber. At transmission speeds in excess of 10 Gbps, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to compensate for the degradation of light signals using traditional techniques. In addition, these traditional techniques require cumbersome and expensive equipment and do not meet network operators’ demands for high-quality signals. In the mid-2000s, advanced modulation techniques enabled by coherent communications techniques and digital signal processing were introduced to increase transmission speeds above 10 Gbps. However, these advanced modulation techniques required significant changes in the underlying optical interconnect technologies and architecture.
Coherent communications is a more complex method of transmitting and receiving information via optical signals. Coherent technologies enable greater utilization of complex formats that manipulate both a signal’s amplitude and its phase to yield a higher data transmission rate with better resilience to signal degradation. Coherent communications enables powerful digital signal processing to counter digitally the effects of signal degradation that were previously managed through an array of discrete components and costly techniques, such as optical dispersion compensation. By taking advantage of coherent communications technologies, some cloud and service providers are able to operate networks at transmission speeds of up to 400 Gbps today and are increasingly adopting technologies that enable 1,000 Gbps and above transmission speeds. These providers require advanced coherent interconnect solutions.
Digital signal processing in coherent interconnect technologies takes place in an application-specific integrated circuit known as a coherent DSP ASIC. Building a coherent DSP ASIC is a multi-disciplinary undertaking requiring advanced knowledge of several complex technologies, such as optical systems, transmission, communications theory, digital signal processing algorithms and mixed signal design, and the development and verification of complex communications ASICs. To complete an interconnect solution, the coherent DSP ASIC must be used in conjunction with a number of photonic functions, such as modulation and transmission/reception. These functions have traditionally been performed by several discrete, bulky, expensive components that must be purchased by a network equipment manufacturer and designed into custom interface circuit boards before deployment. The development of a photonic integrated circuit, or PIC, enables dramatic improvements in size and cost by tightly integrating multiple photonic functions into a small integrated circuit.
Our Solution—The Siliconization of Optical Interconnect Technology
We have developed several families of high-speed coherent interconnect modules that reduce the complexity, size, power consumption and cost of optical interconnect technology, while simultaneously improving network performance, speed and accelerating the pace of innovation in the optical networking industry. We build these advanced optical interconnect products using silicon, by implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect. The siliconization of optical interconnect allows us to integrate previously disparate optical functions into a single solution, leading to significant improvements in density and cost and allowing us to benefit from ongoing advances in CMOS. Our optical interconnect solution includes sophisticated modules that perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions required to process network traffic at transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and above in long-haul, metro and inter-data center networks. Our modules meet the needs of cloud and service providers for optical 
4

interconnect products in a simple, open, high-performance form factor that can be easily integrated in a cost-effective manner with existing network equipment.
Our optical interconnect products are powered by our internally developed and purpose-built coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are engineered to work together, and each integrates numerous signal processing and optical functions that together deliver a complete, cost-effective high-speed coherent optical interconnect solution in a small footprint that requires low power and provides significant automation and management capabilities. We believe that our highly integrated optical interconnect modules, which are based on our coherent DSP ASIC and silicon PIC, were, at the time of market introduction, the industry’s first interconnect modules to deliver transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and higher. Prior to the introduction of our highly integrated optical interconnect modules, we believe that these transmission speeds were not possible in modules in an industry standard form factor without sacrificing signal quality or other performance characteristics. For example, our CFP- and CFP2-DCO modules, which are based on the industry-standard CFP and CFP2 form factors, enable cloud and service providers to easily upgrade their existing metro and inter-data center networks to 100 Gbps and 200 Gbps using their existing, deployed equipment chassis or newly designed network equipment with CFP slot capabilities. Furthermore, by providing an integrated solution that incorporates digital signal processing and optical functionality required to process and transmit data through a high-speed optical channel, our optical interconnect products reduce the resource requirements of the network equipment manufacturers necessary to build and service equipment with high-speed optical interconnect functionality.
We believe we were the first independent vendor to introduce at commercial scale both a coherent DSP ASIC and a silicon PIC integrated into an optical interconnect module. By designing our silicon PIC in CMOS, which is widely used in the semiconductor industry and generally does not require special packaging, we are able to reduce cost, increase reliability and take advantage of the ongoing improvement of CMOS technology, as well as contract with foundries for the manufacture of many of our products. Our silicon PIC incorporates several key optics functions, including modulation and transmission/reception functions, and supports transmission distances for long-haul, metro and inter-data center applications. We believe that our silicon PIC was the first commercially available PIC to include all of these functions over a broad range of transmission distances. By building both our coherent DSP ASIC and our silicon PIC in CMOS, we can improve the performance and efficiency of the optical interconnect technology and benefit from engineering synergies.
The advantages of our solution include:

• | Industry-leading speed, density and power consumption. We believe that our coherent DSP ASICs, silicon PICs and 100 to 1,200 Gbps optical interconnect modules consume less power and have higher density than comparable optical interconnect products. Our modules perform functions that have traditionally been provided by several discrete pieces of network equipment. 


• | Breadth of integration. By integrating many photonic functions into our silicon PIC and further integrating our silicon PIC in our modules, we enable simplified network equipment designs and reduce the amount of development and optical engineering our customers would otherwise do internally, thereby freeing up their engineering resources to focus on other networking functions. 


• | Software intelligence. Our products incorporate software intelligence that automates tasks, such as channel provisioning, and increases manageability through a high level of software features, including increased monitoring and optimization. 


• | Cost-efficiency. We are able to offer our products at attractive price points as a result of the scale and process benefits of our CMOS platforms. In addition, the performance capabilities of our products permit greater flexibility and can reduce both design cost for the network equipment manufacturer and network design and ongoing operational cost for the cloud or service provider. 


• | Ease of deployment. By leveraging industry-standard interfaces, our modules enable cloud and service providers to immediately increase the speed and capacity of their networks by replacing their legacy 10 or 40 Gbps components with our 100 to 1,200 Gbps modules in their existing equipment. Our modules can also easily be deployed in next generation network equipment. 

Our Competitive Strengths
Our goal is to maintain and extend our competitive advantages through rapid innovation delivering industry-leading high-speed interconnect products to our customers by focusing on the following key areas:

• | Leading provider of high-speed integrated optical interconnect modules. We believe we were the first independent vendor to introduce at commercial scale both a coherent DSP ASIC and a silicon PIC integrated into an 

5

optical interconnect module capable of transmission speeds of 100 Gbps and above. Our modules solve many of the shortcomings of existing interconnect solutions and meet the majority of a cloud or service provider’s interconnect needs in a standard and compact form factor that can be easily integrated with other network equipment. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs enable us to offer advanced optical interconnect products with desirable features such as high density, low power and high performance.

• | Track record of rapid innovation driven by advanced design methodologies. We maximize the pace of innovation through a number of measures, including the creation of an expanding tool box of digital signal processing algorithms, ASIC implementations, CMOS-compatible optics subsystems and related intellectual property, which enable us to develop complex products at a competitive pace by reusing and expanding existing solutions. Our development, verification and test infrastructure and methodologies involve extensive automation, which increase the speed and quality of our development. Our ability to innovate at a rapid pace enables us to offer products purpose-built for different applications and based on the newest CMOS technology. We believe these design, innovation and development capabilities have enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs for use in applications across multiple markets, including long-haul, metro and inter-data center. 


• | Leveraging the strength of CMOS for photonics. The density and cost of high-speed optical interconnect products have traditionally been determined by the photonic components. Implementing the photonic components in CMOS, and using CMOS as the platform for the integration of multiple discrete photonics functions, enables us to significantly reduce the density and cost of our optical interconnect products compared to traditional approaches, which typically rely on complex materials such as lithium niobate, which does not permit the same level of integration, and does not benefit from the ongoing advances in CMOS technology driven by the entire electronics industry. 


• | Proprietary software framework enables simplified configuration and deployment. We have made substantial investments in the software components of our products, which we believe is key to increasing the performance and reducing the capital expenditures and operating expenses associated with high-speed networks. Our software framework also facilitates the integration of the many complex digital signal processing, ASIC, hardware and optical functions required in high-speed interconnect technologies and enables our customers to integrate our products easily into their existing networks. Through the use of software, we are able to configure the same product to be deployed in various network types with different needs and requirements, without the need to modify or reconfigure the network’s architecture, providing us with significant development and manufacturing efficiencies. 


• | Customer collaboration provides deep understanding of market needs. We collaborate closely with network equipment manufacturers, as well as directly with many cloud and service providers, and solicit their input as they design their network equipment and as we design our next-generation products. This provides us with deep insights into the current and future needs of our customers and the market, which in turn enables us to develop and deliver products that meet customer demands and anticipate market developments. 


• | Strong management and engineering teams with significant industry expertise. We have deliberately built our management and engineering teams, of which our founders remain a key part, to include personnel with extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of our employees are engineers or have other technical backgrounds, and approximately 48% of our employees hold a Ph.D. or other advanced degree. Each element of our solution is developed by experts in the relevant field. Our collaborative development culture encourages employees with diverse experiences and expertise to work together to create innovative solutions. 

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading provider of high-speed interconnect technology that underpins the world’s data and communication networks. To grow our business and achieve our mission, we are pursuing the following strategies:

• | Continue to innovate and extend our technology leadership. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are at the heart of our products’ abilities to deliver cost-efficient high performance. We intend to continue to invest in our technology to deliver innovative and high-performance products and to identify and solve challenging interconnect needs. We expect that our continued investments in research and development will enable us to expand and enhance the capabilities of our CMOS-based products in order to continue to develop higher-capacity and higher-density software-enabled products. We are also developing a 400ZR module that will expand our pluggable module product group, and enable inter-data center transmission capacity of 400 Gbps in the same compact pluggable form factors 

6

used for 400G client optics, including QSFP-DD and OSFP. We also plan to continue to invest in silicon PIC innovation and its optimization with our coherent DSP ASICs in order to serve the growing demand for bandwidth.

• | Increase penetration within our existing customer base. We focus heavily on the needs of our customers and frequently innovate in partnership with them to deliver cost-effective products that meet their specific needs. As we continue to enhance and expand our product groups, and as our existing customers seek to expand and improve their network equipment technology, we believe there is potential to generate additional revenue through sales of existing and new products to these customers. 


• | Continue to expand customer base. We believe there continues to be unmet need for high-speed, cost-efficient interconnect products among cloud and service providers. Historically, our sales were primarily to network equipment manufacturers that did not have internally developed coherent DSP ASICs. More recently, we have had success in marketing and selling our products to network equipment manufacturers that have internally developed their own coherent DSP ASICs. We believe that the benefits of our solution, supported by the success of existing customers as references, will drive more network equipment manufacturers to purchase their interconnect products from us. We plan to continue to acquire new customers through expanded sales and marketing and brand recognition efforts. 


• | Grow into adjacent markets. We believe that growth in fiber optics-based communications is likely to accelerate, partly driven by the cost and density advantages of our CMOS solution, and that this growth, together with expansion in other markets that depend on high-speed networking capabilities, as well as adjacent markets, such as access aggregation in 5G, Multi-System Operators and Fiber to the x, and intra-data center networking, will result in demand for additional applications for our products. These adjacent markets often place a greater importance on interoperability standards than traditional telecom applications. The purpose of the 400ZR project at the Optical Internetworking Forum, and parallel efforts at CableLabs and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, is to address this need for interoperability and, in some cases, consider additional specifications and requirements of these adjacent market applications. We believe our ability to develop compact, pluggable, low-power optical interconnect products will create further opportunities for us to serve new types of customers, including companies that do not have sufficient optical engineering expertise to develop systems using current interconnect technologies. 


• | Selectively pursue investments, acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Although we are focused on expanding our market share organically, we may pursue investments, acquisitions or other strategic transactions that complement our existing business, represent a strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. 

Our Products
Our products fall into three product groups: embedded modules, pluggable modules and semiconductors.

Semiconductors
DSP ASICs
Our coherent DSP ASICs incorporate our proprietary signal processing algorithms to meet the power and performance requirements of the inter-data center, metro, long-haul and submarine markets. We selectively offer our coherent DSP ASIC as a standalone component to customers designing their own coherent modules and line-cards.
Silicon PICs
Our coherent silicon PICs incorporate multiple coherent optical functions, such as transmission and reception, in a single package. The high level of integration in our silicon PICs enables high density designs of coherent modules and linecards. We selectively offer our silicon PIC as a standalone component to customers for designs that may or may not utilize our DSP components.
Sales and Marketing
We curently market and sell our products through a direct sales force consisting of sales personnel and centralized and field-based technical customer support and may in the future market and sell our products through third-party distributors. Our sales force also works closely with our product line management personnel to support strategic sales activities.
Our products typically have a long sales cycle, requiring discussions with prospective customers in order to better understand their network and system level requirements and technology roadmaps. Our customers are predominantly network equipment manufacturers, network operators and cloud service providers and we have discussions with them regarding the 
8

requirements of their end customers, which provides our sales force with insight into how our products will be integrated into our customers’ solutions and how these systems will be deployed in the networks of their end customers. This sales process requires us to develop strong customer relationships. The period of time from our initial contact with a prospective or current customer to the receipt of purchase orders for high-volume production is frequently a year or more. Prospective customers perform system and network level testing before equipment is deployed in a network carrying live traffic. We perform extensive reliability and verification testing based on industry standards and as further guided by the requirements of our customers. This phase of our sales cycle can take several months and purchase arrangements may not be entered into until after this phase is completed. In addition, once the first purchase order is placed by a customer, it may take several months or longer for that customer to increase the volume of its purchases.
We invest time and resources to meet with leading carriers and cloud service providers to understand network system performance issues. These efforts provide us with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by carriers and cloud service providers which, in turn, enables us to focus our future product and technology development efforts to address those challenges. For example, understanding that several of our customers are planning to adopt technologies that enable up to 1,000 Gbps and higher transmission speeds, we are currently developing products to satisfy these requirements.
Our in-house sales personnel also assist customers with orders, delivery requirements and warranty returns. Our technical support engineers respond to technical and product-related questions, provide simulation tools to enable customers to optimize their optical link design and provide application support to customers who have incorporated our products into their systems. In general, we have centralized our technical support operations at our corporate headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts. Our centralized customer support operations allow our technical customer support personnel to work directly with our research and development and operations personnel on first-line customer technical support as well as escalated specialized technical support, which reduces the time it takes to identify and address our customers’ issues and helps our personnel maintain and improve upon their technical skills. We also provide first-line customer technical support to our international customers on-site from our offices in California, China and Europe.
Customers
The number of customers who have purchased and deployed our products has increased from eight in 2011 to more than 30 during 2018. We have historically generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our five largest customers in each period (which differed by period) collectively accounted for 74%, 70% and 78% of our revenue, respectively. In 2018, ZTE, Infinera Corporation, or Infinera, which on October 1, 2018 acquired another of our customers, Coriant, Inc, or Coriant, including all 2018 revenue from Infinera and Coriant, ADVA Optical Networking North America, Inc., or ADVA, and Cisco Systems, Inc. and its affiliates, together Cisco, accounted for 20%, 17%, 15% and 14% of our revenue, respectively. In 2017, ZTE, ADVA and Coriant accounted for 30%, 15% and 11% of our revenue, respectively. In 2016, ZTE and ADVA accounted for 32% and 26% of our revenue, respectively.
Manufacturing
We utilize a range of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes to develop and manufacture the coherent DSP ASICs, silicon PICs and other components that are designed into our modules. We select the semiconductor process and foundry that provides the best combination of performance, cost and feature attributes necessary for our products.
We engage two contract manufacturers to test, build and inspect modules incorporating our coherent DSP ASICs, silicon PICs and other components for high-volume production of our products. These contract manufacturers also implement many customer-specific configurations and packaging requirements before shipment to our customers. We build the test systems used by our contract manufacturers. We also directly manufacture prototype products during initial new product introduction. We believe our outsourced manufacturing model enables us to focus our resources and expertise on the design, sale, support and marketing of our products to best meet customer requirements. We also believe that this manufacturing model provides us with the flexibility required to respond to new market opportunities and changes in customer demand, simplifies the scope of our operations and administrative processes and significantly reduces our working capital requirements, while providing the ability to scale production rapidly.
We subject our contract manufacturers, fabrication foundries and the suppliers of standard, as well as our custom-designed, components to qualification requirements in order to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. Our engineers and supply chain personnel work closely with our contract manufacturers and fabrication foundries to increase yield, reduce manufacturing costs, improve product quality and ensure that component sourcing strategies are in place to support our manufacturing needs.

Research and Development
Our engineering group has extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, ASIC development and design, silicon photonic integration, system software development and high-speed electronics design. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of all our employees are engineers or have other technical backgrounds, and approximately 48% of all our employees hold a Ph.D. or other advanced degree. We utilize our hardware and software expertise to integrate coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs into high-speed interconnect products that are compatible with industry-standard form factor, interfaces and power consumption requirements. We participate in industry groups such as Open ROADM, Optical Internetworking Forum, CableLabs and IEEE to help drive the industry towards standardization that allows for the integration of our products into diverse optical systems. In addition, we offer our integration expertise to our customers to help expedite their adoption of new products.
We use simulation tools at many levels of product development, reducing the number of design errors and the need for costly and time consuming development cycles. Our simulation environment makes use of industry standard computer aided design tools as well as models and tools that are developed internally. Our simulation tools also allow us to make efficient tradeoffs between power consumption, size and performance early in the development cycle. We believe this contributes to the ability of our products to deliver superior performance with low power consumption.
Our research and development facilities are located in Maynard, Massachusetts, Holmdel, New Jersey, San Jose, California, Ottawa, Canada, Bengaluru, India and Wooburn Green, United Kingdom. We have devoted approximately 116,000 square feet of space to our research and development facilities, which we expect to increase in the future. Our research and development facilities are equipped with industry standard test equipment, including optical spectrum analyzers, high-speed sampling oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, wafer probes, wafer saws, optical network and Ethernet test sets, thousands of kilometers of optical fiber and associated optical amplifiers and other optical test equipment. We use these facilities to conduct comprehensive testing and validation procedures on internally produced chips, components and products before transferring production to our contract manufacturers for commercial, higher-volume manufacturing.
As research and development is critical to our continuing success, we are committed to maintaining high levels of research and development over the long term. We incurred research and development expenses of $102.4 million, $92.0 million and $75.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property rights. We generally rely on patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we generally require employees and consultants to execute appropriate non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information remain confidential.
We maintain a program designed to identify technology that is appropriate for patent and trade secret protection, and we file patent applications in the United States and, when appropriate, certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. As of December 31, 2018, we had 52 patents granted in the United States and three patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, which expire between 2027 and 2037. We also had 63 patent applications pending in the United States, five patent applications pending under Patent Cooperation Treaty filings, 20 pending foreign patent applications. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent, our patent rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. In addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights. We control access to and use of our software, technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we have expanded our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Companies in the industry in which we operate frequently are sued or receive informal claims of patent infringement or infringement of other intellectual property rights. We have, from time to time, received such claims from companies, including from competitors and customers, some of which have substantially more resources and have been developing relevant technology for much longer than us. As we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that 
10

competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could result in significant penalties or injunctions that could prevent us from selling some of our products in certain markets, result in settlements or judgments that require payment of significant royalties or damages or require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing products. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
Competition
The optical communications markets are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although we believe we have few competitors that compete with us across all our product lines and markets. Our principal competitors in one or more of our product lines or markets include Finisar, Fujitsu Optical Components, Inphi, Lumentum Holdings, NEL, Neophotonics and Sumitomo Electric Industries. We also compete with internally developed coherent interconnect solutions of certain network equipment manufacturers, including Ciena, Huawei and Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent). Finally, we face competition from optical interconnect modules that are the result of joint developments among certain of the competitors listed above. Consolidation in the optical systems and components industry has increased in recent years, and future consolidation could further intensify the competitive pressures that we face.
The principal competitive factors upon which we compete include performance, low power consumption, rapid innovation, breadth of product line, availability, product reliability, reputation, level of integration and cost, multi-sourcing and selling price. We believe that we compete effectively by offering high levels of customer value through high speed, high density, low power consumption, broad integration of photonic functions, software intelligence for configuration, control and monitoring, cost-efficiency, ease of deployment and collaborative product design. We cannot be certain we will continue to compete effectively.
We also may face competition from companies that may expand into our industry and introduce additional competitive products. The same standardization that allows for the integration of our products into diverse optical systems carries the side effect of lowing the competitive threshold for new market entrants. Existing and potential customers and strategic partners are also potential competitors. These customers may internally develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies, selectively, or through consolidation of the companies in our industry, which may cause them to reduce or cease their purchases from us.
Government Regulation
Our products and services are subject to export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and similar laws and regulations that apply in other jurisdictions in which we distribute or sell our products and services. Export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations include restrictions and prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services and on our transfer of parts, components, and related technical information and know-how to certain countries, regions, governments, persons and entities. For example, on April 15, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce activated a denial order against ZTE and an affiliated company based on adverse findings relating to the activities covered by ZTE’s 2016 settlement with the U.S. Department of Commerce to resolve charges of export control violations by ZTE. This denial order added ZTE and the affiliate to the “Denied Persons List,” suspending U.S. export privileges of ZTE and the affiliate, prohibiting them from participating in transactions subject to U.S. Department of Commerce export control regulations, and prohibiting other businesses and individuals, including us, from certain activities in support of ZTE’s business. On June 8, 2018, ZTE and the U.S. Department of Commerce reached a new settlement imposing additional penalties and compliance measures upon ZTE, pursuant to which the denial order was terminated and ZTE was removed from the Denied Persons List effective July 13, 2018. Although this further U.S. Department of Commerce action authorized us to resume sales to and related activities involving ZTE, there can be no guarantee that the U.S. Congress or U.S. regulatory authorities will not take future legislative or regulatory action that may materially interfere with our ability to make sales to ZTE or other of our customers, particularly in China. Even without such action, we would be prohibited from exporting our products to any foreign recipient if we have knowledge that a violation of U.S. export regulations has occurred, is about to occur, or is intended to occur in connection with the item. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, transfers within foreign countries, and importation of our products, including by our partners, must comply with these laws and regulations.
We are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations in other places where we 
11

do business. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to governmental, political and certain international organization officials for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business. Our exposure for violating these laws and regulations increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition, we are subject to, or are expected to facilitate our customers’ compliance with, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, employee health and safety and the use of hazardous materials in, and the recycling of, our products.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 386 full-time employees, consisting of 192 in research and development, 98 in operations, which includes manufacturing, supply chain, quality control and assurance, 96 in executive, sales, general and administrative, and five part-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
