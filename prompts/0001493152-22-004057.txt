ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
History and Development of Business
 
GEX Management, Inc. was originally formed in 2004 by Carl Dorvil as Group Excellence Management, LLC. d/b/a MyEasyHQ. In March of 2016, it was converted from a limited liability company into a C corporation and changed its name to GEX Management, Inc.
 
GEX Management initially began operations as a Professional Services Company providing back office support to third-party clients. In 2016 GEX Management revised its business model to provide staffing and back-office services to a wide variety of industries in order to expand the Company’s footprint, thereby building on the previous 12-year history of exceptional client service. Over the next few years, GEX Management experienced tremendous growth in sales and customer pipeline - staffing business grew by over 1600%+ from 2016 to 2017 with the firm being named among the “fastest growing public companies in the North Texas region” by the Dallas Morning News, while also significantly expanding its client footprints across multiple staffing, business consulting and PEO opportunities.
 
In 2019, the current management of GEX under the guidance of the current CEO, Sri Vanamali, set strategic goals to revise the business model to expand into areas of higher margin and growth particularly in the area of Technology and Strategy Consulting Services. As a result of management efforts, GEX Management was invited in February 2019 to be a Preferred Supplier to Insight Global (www.insightglobal.com), one of the world’s largest Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to Fortune 100 Companies in the Enterprise Technology Consulting space. The first consultant that GEX hired through this Preferred Supplier initiative was successfully placed at a large PA based financial services firm to provide Business and Quality Analysis professional services to the client. Subsequently, GEX placed its second enterprise consultant at the world’s leading Fortune 100 CRM Company at its headquarters in San Francisco and subsequently several more highly skilled Enterprise Technology Consultants at leading Fortune 500 retail, healthcare, manufacturing and technology clients across the country . As a direct result of the high market demand for experienced technology consultants via its multiple supplier programs, the GEX team has interviewed and is in the process of procuring 45 highly experienced enterprise technology consultants with expertise across a wide array of functions (Enterprise Architects, Project Managers, Systems Integration Developers, Quality Assurance Specialists and Business Systems Analysts) who have been identified for various short to long term projects and are expected to be fully staffed by its corporate clients by Q4 2021. Additionally, GEX plans to hire and place more than 100 enterprise consultants over the next 18 - 24 month period to satisfy its growing pipeline of future contracts. As a result of these market initiatives, GEX forecasts to potentially achieve approximately $20- $25M in gross billings over the next 18-24 month period, assuming all projected contracts are fully placed on projects that have been currently identified by the GEX supplier program pipeline and businesses begin to re-open as the pandemic related restrictions are removed.
 
In Q4 2019, GEX signed a contract with one of the fastest growing, VC backed social video platform to provide key corporate and strategy consulting services – an initiative that the CEO was personally involved with in developing and growing the strategic business relationship over the last two years. This contract has resulted in enormous growth opportunities for GEX and is expected to significantly expand growth in future periods as well. GEX has also signed additional contracts to provide interim “CFO” and “CEO” consulting services to various high growth public and private companies, resulting in doubling of sales within a year and achieving an astounding double digit expansion in gross margins despite the pandemic related recessionary business environment. Furthermore, GEX is in talks with multiple companies to identify synergistic acquisition opportunities to fuel organic and inorganic growth and fulfil the corporate objective of becoming a top tier business and technology focused firm while also developing a long term and sustainable technology centric business model. Management expects these growth initiatives to help the firm eventually achieve strong and stable revenue growth while also achieving sustainable long term profitability by targeting a higher margin, lower cost model and relying on less expensive debt instruments to help reduce the burden across the firm’s capital structure.
 
In addition to these planned strategic growth initiatives which had started to build momentum in 2019 and are expected to gain significant traction in 2021 and beyond, management has been focusing on materially improving its balance sheet by significantly reducing or eliminating the debt or debt like instruments related to convertible notes and asset related liens introduced in 2018 while simultaneously exploring opportunities to reduce or eliminate the high interest MCA related toxic debt instruments that resulted in significant interest expenses to the company and a burden to operating capital. As part of this balance sheet “clean-up” initiative, on February 8 2019, GEXM and the G&C Family LLC executed a “Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure” agreement the terms of which would allow GEXM to release ownership of the Arkansas building under AMAST LLC to the G&C Family Group, LLC in return for cancellation of the $1,300,000 real estate lien note secured by the building along with any and all accrued interest payable on the note as of the date of the agreement. Additionally, on March 5, 2019, one of GEX’s promissory note holders proceeded to execute its rights to enforce the liens on the Setco property through a foreclosure process which resulted in the note holder taking possession of the Setco property resulting in the elimination of a $500,000 note and any accrued interest on the principal amount and the elimination of $1,125,000 Setco real estate lien note made to Setco along with any accrued interests from the Company books. Furthermore, GEX has been able to significantly reduce the overall debt and debt like instruments on the balance sheet through strategic conversions of convertible notes to common equity initiated by the convertible note issuers throughout 2019 and 2020 and settlement or elimination of certain MCA and debt like instruments. This focus on balance sheet cleanup and to stay significantly “asset-lite” is expected to achieve material results by Q4 2021, at which point GEX would be primed for its next phase of strategic growth initiatives by deploying equity and non-toxic debt instruments towards organic and inorganic opportunities. Finally, management believes that the material elimination of MCA and related debt like instruments will be a critical first step prior to rebuilding a robust revenue pipeline as this will require strong working capital and favorable leverage covenants to sustain operations in the long term as well as reduce liabilities related to attachment to future receivables. While management efforts to settle these instruments are aggressively underway, the inability or failure by the firm to completely address any toxic debt instruments could result in management pursuing a restructuring program or similar initiatives to bring the balance sheet within reasonable covenant parameters to allow the firm to continue operating efficiently in the coming years without exposing future customers to significant business risks associated with these toxic instruments. As part of this long term strategy, management has already begin putting processes in place to protect the company via a robust internal restructuring program and will be announcing the outcome of these intra-company restructuring efforts that will protect the interests of investors and shareholders alike over the long term and also streamline the corporate structure to be synergistic with the management’s long term vision for the company.

Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to become a leading management consulting, technology and business services company, and to continuously expand our client base. We seek to achieve this objective by continuing to implement our business strategy, which includes the primary elements enumerated below.
Marketing and Sales
 
Our comprehensive marketing efforts are fluid, adaptive, and results-driven. They comprise both traditional and non- traditional channels including print collateral, website, video, PowerPoint presentations, digital ads, social media posts and press releases. We likewise employ a small sales team. We strategically target large and medium sized businesses
 that require the services we provide. Previously, a significant amount of corporate revenue has been derived through client referrals and management’s personal relationships. Our plan is to continue to leverage these important relationships while expanding our brand reach by means of integrated marketing campaigns, more timely, informative, and effectual messaging, and greater collaboration between marketing and sales in order to increase both client and sales growth.
 
Industry and Competitors
 
The Professional Staffing industry is highly fragmented, resulting in robust competition. Competition affects our success in both the market segments we currently serve, as well as the new market segments we may enter in the future. We compete with several large management and technology consulting companies that provide identical services to those GEX Management provides; some offer additional services. The financial and marketing resources of some of our competitors exceed those of GEX Management. Businesses primarily select a service provider based on price point/value, innovative/flexible product offerings, and quality of customer service.
Environmental Concerns
 
As a professional services company, federal, state or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not impact us.
 
Other Events
 
The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. In addition, at this time we cannot predict the impact of COVID-19 on our ability to obtain financing necessary for the Company to fund its working capital requirements. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
