ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
We seek to provide solutions that bring transparency and accountability to the digital out of home (“DOOH”) advertising marketplace. Alfi uses artificial intelligence and big data analytics to measure and disseminate audience presence and audience demographics. Our computer vision technology is powered by proprietary artificial intelligence, to determine the relevant demographic and geospecific information of the audience in front of an Alfi-enabled device, such as a tablet or kiosk. Alfi can then deliver in real-time, the advertisements to that particular viewer based on the viewer’s demographic profile and/or geolocation. Alfi is designed to deliver the right marketing content, to the right person at the right time in a responsible and ethical manner. By delivering the advertisements most relevant to the audience in front of the device, we connect our advertising customers to the viewers they seek to target. The result is higher click through rates (“CTRs”), higher QR code scans and higher cost per thousand rates (“CPMs”).
Alfi seeks to solve the problems facing advertisers in the DOOH marketplace, as its proprietary technology is designed to measure the audience when an advertisement is displayed. Our data rich reporting functionality is able to inform the advertiser exactly when someone viewed each ad, as well as the general demographic and geospecific characteristics of the viewing audience. Alfi can provide large and small businesses access to data-driven insights by expanding their advertising capabilities, by providing analytical sophistication and by delivering it all over multiple devices. In addition to the traditional Content Management System model that delivers adverts on a scheduled loop, Alfi’s technology is able to first analyze the audience and determine the most relevant content to be displayed.
Alfi has created an enterprise grade, multimedia computer vision and machine learning platform, capable of generating powerful advertising recommendations and insights. Multiple technologies work together with viewer privacy and data-rich reporting as our primary objectives. Alfi is able to use a facial fingerprinting process to make demographic determinations. As such, Alfi makes no attempt to identify the individual in front of the screen. Brand owners do not need to know someone’s name or invade their privacy to gain a deeper understanding of the consumers who view their content. By providing age, gender and geolocation information, we believe brand owners should have the pertinent data they need for meaningful insight. From an analytics perspective, these data points are intended to provide meaningful reporting instead of arbitrary calculations based on estimates of ad engagement.
Alfi seeks to solve the problem of providing real time, accurate and rich reporting on customer demographics, usage, interactivity and engagement while never storing any personally identifiable information. No viewer is ever required, or requested by us, to enter any information about themselves on any Alfi-enabled device.
Our initial focus is to place our Alfi-enabled devices in malls, airports rideshares and taxis. We also have begun offering our software solution to other DOOH media operators as a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) product.
Currently, we intend to charge customers solely based on a CPM, or ads delivered, model. As we continue to deploy Alfi in the marketplace, we expect to charge customers based on a combination of CPM and CTR, and we expect we will generate higher CPM rates than typical DOOH advertising platforms because we have the ability to only deliver ads to the customer’s desired demographic. In addition, we also intend to provide the aggregated data to the brands so they can make more informed advertising decisions.
Advertising Industry Background
According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau Internet Advertising Revenue Report, the digital advertising (internet) marketplace grew to $189 billion in 2021. The DOOH marketplace is experiencing rapid growth due to, among other things, the rise in digitization and the declining demand for traditional billboards, paired with easy data integration. Additionally, we believe that the reduced cost of digital screens will also drive the market opportunity. Previously, advertisers could not effectively target viewers in out of home (“OOH”) and DOOH, having instead to rely on either static boards, or if placed on digital screens, their advertisements could only be played in an ongoing multi-ad loop for mass reach without viewer-based targeting.
In online advertising, advertisers have had access to behavioral and personal user data to know more about the viewer through the use of “cookies”. The tracking cookie has been a key component to the growth of online advertising, built into nearly every website 

4



and online / mobile advertising medium. Cookies are designed to provide a system to capture personal data about customers, their browsing history, and their preferences and behaviors. Depending on the sophistication and the data solicited, an advertiser could learn a great deal about their potential customers and target their ad messaging accordingly. The data derived has been used in targeting and retargeting ads, behavioral marketing tactics and display advertising strategies. Cookies are the reason the ads a viewer was served as they browsed websites on their phone, tablet or computer would align with their interests and browsing history.
The data that cookies gathered was intrusive, and consumers have come to distrust cookies primarily because of their invasive nature and privacy concerns. Smart technologies and apps have been developed to allow consumers to block cookies, and many consumers have done so. Globally, cookies are generally in the process of being phased out for online advertising and major search engines, forcing advertisers to rely more on contextual-based marketing rather than viewer-based targeting. This has forced advertisers to look for new ways to track consumer behavior without invading a consumer’s privacy, exposing the need for a new, targeted advertising technology that also prioritizes privacy compliance.
Historically, in the DOOH advertising marketplace, the best targeting an advertiser could utilize was the geolocation of their ad delivery on a screen (kiosk, video wall, digital billboard, etc.), day parting (time specific ad delivery), or an estimated forecast of the expected number of people that would be in that area based on typical consumer traffic for that time of year (such as a mall or an airport). Advertisers would not get any information on the audience that might have actually seen their ad, for how long the ad was viewed, or the actual count of people in the area when the ad was displayed. This resulted in wasted advertising dollars spent reaching the wrong audience (target market) or no audience at all – also known as unmeasurable and unverifiable impressions. This approach of unverified impressions meant a significant percentage of DOOH campaigns were executed to the wrong targets or no targets at all.
Internet advertising has faced another growing issue with online ad fraud. Digital advertising fraud occurs when an ad is displayed on either a fake website or to a ‘bot’ in an effort to inflate web traffic numbers, or served below the viewing area on the screen (but still charged as a delivered “impression.”) Data and confidence in ad delivery is critically important to advertisers. Savvy advertisers recognize that they need to make their decisions based on more comprehensive and accurate data to improve the efficiency of their advertising dollars. Currently, advertisers cannot get that data in DOOH because it does not exist.
By providing artificial intelligence based, facial detection driven real time and post campaign reporting data, and delivering advertisements to the desired demographic, Alfi seeks to solve both problems facing advertisers in the DOOH and digital advertising marketplace without invading the privacy of the person viewing the ad.
Our Strategy
Alfi seeks to solve the problems facing advertisers in the DOOH marketplace, as its proprietary technology is able to determine when an advertisement was displayed, verify someone was in front of the screen, as well as report basic demographic and geolocation information. This actualized information is the data that advertisers seek to make strategy decisions. In addition to providing a new type of data to the DOOH marketplace, by telling advertisers actualized numbers as well as the demographic makeup of their campaign’s viewing audience, Alfi’s technology is able to provide confirmation to advertisers that they have reached their desired demographic and total number of purchased impressions. By delivering verified impressions, advertisers know their ad dollars were not wasted and their desired audience was reached, bringing digital accountability and audience transparency to the DOOH marketplace.
The main elements of our growth strategy are:

● | Increase distribution to increase revenue. As we place more devices in areas where people live, work, and play outside the home, we will deliver more campaigns and derive more revenues. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue technological innovation. The enhancements we continue to make to our software are designed to allow us to improve the viewer experience, sharpen our targeting by audience / viewer demographics and deliver better data to our advertiser-customers, while we continue to prioritize privacy compliance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversify revenue streams. As Alfi gathers more data, we intend to sell that data to advertisers, venues and municipalities that do not use the Alfi platform, which we believe will attract additional advertisers and generate advertising revenue. In addition, we intend to enter into joint venture agreements with retailers to provide Alfi-enabled devices at points of sale in their stores to enhance their customer’s experience and sell more product. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | License Alfi to other DOOH media operators. Alfi is a robust, hosted software platform that we intend to make available by SaaS to other DOOH media network operators. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue potential acquisitions. We will seek to acquire additional technologies that we believe will expand Alfi’s software execution and capabilities, as well as companies with DOOH screen networks that will allow us to increase our screen footprint and market penetration. Additionally, we will seek to acquire strategic “launch pads” that have legacy infrastructure and digital hardware, but lack true digital software and are incapable of being as intelligent, interactive, measured and targeted as Alfi enabled networks.

Our Products and Services
Alfi is an enterprise grade, multimedia state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning platform, generating powerful advertising recommendations and insights. Multiple technologies work together in Alfi with viewer privacy and data-rich reporting as our primary objectives. Alfi is able to use a facial fingerprinting process to make demographic determinations. As such, Alfi makes no attempt to identify the individual in front of the screen. Brand owners do not need to know a person’s name or invade their privacy to gain a deeper understanding of the consumers viewing their content. By providing age, gender and geolocation information, we believe brand owners should have all of the data they need for meaningful interaction. From an analytics perspective, these data points are intended to provide meaningful reporting instead of arbitrary calculations of ad engagement.
Alfi can be installed on most Linux or Android-based internet enabled devices enabled with a camera. Our initial rollout of Alfi-owned devices started with tablets connected by cellular data service in taxis and rideshares. The device rollout continues as we target airports and malls with kiosks.
We also will seek to license our software to other DOOH media operators on a subscription basis. In addition to the subscription license fees, we will be able to capture additional data that should give us more detailed demographic information that we will be able to make available to advertisers. We believe there are other uses for Alfi outside of advertising, and we will continue to explore and evaluate such uses so that we may endeavor to license the software for other uses.
Both our tablets and kiosks contain Alfi’s computer vision technology powered by proprietary artificial intelligence that determines the age, gender and geolocation of someone in front of the device. Alfi can then deliver in real-time, curated advertisements to that particular viewer based on the viewer’s demographic and geolocation information. Alfi is designed to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time in a responsible and ethical manner.
Alfi gives large and small businesses access to data-driven insights by expanding their advertising capabilities, by providing analytical sophistication and by delivering it all over multiple devices. If an advertiser wants to target a specific advert to a demographic, Alfi is able to deliver the content whenever a person fitting that demographic is in front of the device.
Marketing Strategy
We intend to market Alfi to advertisers and other DOOH and OOH media operators as the first facial detection-based ad technology offering verified impressions and true audience measurement based on “eyes on screens” (as opposed to measuring “exposed mobile devices” that are within a certain proximity of an OOH ad – which is currently the norm for measurement in the DOOH / OOH marketplace).
We provide Alfi-enabled tablets to independent ride share drivers and taxi fleets who install the tablets on the back of the passenger seat head rest in their vehicles. We intend to market Alfi tablets to the drivers as an additional source of income by earning monthly commissions based on their driving hours with passengers in front of our tablets. We also intend to sell our kiosks into a variety of locations, including, airports, sports venues, shopping malls, hotels, hospitals, transit hubs and museums. We also will seek to enter into revenue sharing agreements with these place-based entities where we install our kiosks, video walls and digital boards, and to sell ads onto their screen network.
We intend to market Alfi to advertisers and ad agencies as the first artificial intelligence-based, demographic targeted digital out of home platform offering verified impressions. We will seek to sell advertising campaigns onto the Alfi tablet network in rideshare and taxi vehicles, and onto our kiosks through revenue share agreements with the place-based digital screen networks (airports, malls, 

6



transit hubs, etc.). By offering advertisers a verified audience / verified impressions capability, DOOH marketers will have the first out of home ad channels that confirm their campaign is being viewed by an actual person or people, in their targeted demographic, and provide data telling them when and where the ads were seen. We believe that verified impressions will allow us (and our partners) to charge premium CPM rates compared with other DOOH and OOH media as well as realize additional revenue by charging for QR code activations, and paying for our data from true campaign measurement.
As mentioned above, we intend to market the Alfi tech stack, facial detection-based ad solution to other DOOH and OOH media operators. Our intended message is that media operators can license Alfi’s software to have it installed onto their screens, thus allowing them to charge more for advertising (because of the targeting capabilities), as well as giving them the access to Alfi’s audience measurement and data. We believe that these capabilities will allow place-based venues to take advantage of the Alfi audience information to sell more advertising, but also to identify the audience details of the people that in fact pass their screens each month and use that information to enhance their other business functions.
Our Technology
Alfi’s technology is a set of independent granular services joined together to create a SaaS cloud-based platform. Coupled with our proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning enabled devices are able to conduct an analysis of an audience in many different contexts.
Additionally, as a member or members of the audience remain in front the device, Alfi is able to monitor the level of engagement and dwell time of that audience, reporting these metrics back to the cloud for curation. This information is then aggregated and disseminated back to the relevant parties via rich reporting with drill-through capabilities.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names. Our domestically-applied for trademarks include, among others, the word mark ALFI, our stylized A and ALFI logos for various software and hardware related to our business. We have registered the word mark ALFI, our stylized A and ALFI logos 

7



mark in a number of foreign countries. Additional domestic and foreign trademark applications are pending. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. We have been granted two patents and have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign countries related to certain aspects of our technology. We have also registered our ownership of the internet domain name “www.getalfi.com” and other internet domain names. We have in the past protected, and expect to continue to protect, our proprietary rights. We cannot predict whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept, services, and products. Any actions or litigation undertaken to enforce our rights will likely be costly. In addition, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties’ trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use certain intellectual property rights or information in the future and may result in a judgment or monetary damages.
Privacy Regulation and Compliance
Multiple technologies work together in Alfi with viewer privacy and reporting objectives as our two goals. Alfi uses a facial fingerprinting process to make demographic determinations. As such, Alfi makes no attempt to identify the individual in front of the screen. Brand owners do not need to know someone’s name or invade their privacy to gain a deeper understanding of the consumers viewing their content. By providing age, gender and geolocation information, we believe brand owners should have all of the data they need for meaningful interaction. From an analytics perspective, these data points are intended to provide meaningful reporting instead of arbitrary calculations of ad engagement.
Alfi seeks to solve the problem of providing real time, accurate and rich reporting on customer demographics, usage, interactivity and engagement while never storing any personal identifiable information. No viewer is ever required, or requested by us, to enter any information about themselves on any Alfi-enabled device. Alfi is designed to be fully compliant with all privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
The GDPR is a comprehensive data privacy law intended to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons related to their personal data. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. Personal data is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person data subject; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. The legal requirements of the GDPR, however, do not apply if the personal data is not processed. Alfi is specifically designed to comply with the most stringent privacy standard of the GDPR. All of Alfi’s capture data systems anonymize incoming data, making the system incapable of identifying a specific person or processing any of their personal data.
Alfi’s data analysis and storage systems prevent violations and hacking through a complex system of protections and maintain privacy compliance as follows:

● | Alfi’s data systems convert a camera’s image of a person’s face into an anonymous vector map for analysis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alfi does not transmit images of the faces or connect any personally identifying information of the audience in front of the screen.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Alfi matrix of conversions from camera image to the anonymous vector map occurs securely within the systems internal artificial intelligence network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alfi’s doesn’t collect or store any personal data, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers of the viewing audience within its systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continually monitor evolving privacy standards to make sure Alfi is compliant with the most stringent standards that could apply to our data.

Competition
The digital video advertising market is intensely competitive, with many companies providing competing solutions. We believe rideshare and taxi- based advertising is a growing segment of the expanding DOOH and OOH marketplace. In-car digital video ads playing on internet connected networks of tablets in the backseat is a popular media option in the rideshare based area. Alfi primarily competes with companies that have in-car tablet networks, and secondarily with companies providing rideshare advertising opportunities in general; through digital screens mounted on top of the cars and also messaging outside the car with vehicle wraps. The competitive in-car tablet networks are operated by Octopus (recently purchased by T-Mobile), Curb Mobility (Taxi TV), Creative Mobile Technology (CMT), and Firefly Systems. Each competitor has in-car digital tablets through which they sell advertising to the rideshare audience of passengers.
Alfi will also compete with online advertising publishers, online search engines, and social media platforms, such as Google (YouTube and DoubleClick), The Trade Desk and Facebook, for advertisers and ad networks.
Alfi’s SaaS product is a full stack ad tech solution utilizing artificial intelligence based, facial detection technology for content management, ad serving and audience measurement to DOOH media network operators such as airports, shopping malls, sports venues, transit hubs, etc. In this regard, we will compete with other software as service business such as Quividi (from France) and Ad Mobilize (from Miami Lakes, Florida).
Our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with advertisers, or other parties, which will limit our ability to promote our solutions and generate revenue. For example, advertiser customers that adopt demand-side advertiser platforms disrupt our direct customer relationship with those customers. Competitors could also seek to gain market share by reducing the prices they charge to publishers or advertisers, introducing products and solutions that are similar to ours or introducing new technology tools for advertisers and digital media properties. Moreover, increased competition for video advertising inventory from digital media properties could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to digital media property owners to acquire that advertising inventory.
Some large advertising agencies that represent advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect advertisers with digital media properties. Our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and digital media properties purchase and sell advertising inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, ad exchange or other third-party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.
Our Team
We are a development stage company and currently have approximately 40 employees, including 33 full time employees. Of our employees, 13 are technical developers of Alfi and 10 are sales and marketing focused. We have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a union or parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees and consultants to be good.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to:

● | Provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide more than two years of audited financial statements and related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or hold stockholder advisory votes on the executive compensation required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of the:

● | Last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or more in total annual gross revenues;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more as of June 30);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, which we completed on May 6, 2021 (“IPO”).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
