ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of nitric oxide (“NO”) generators and delivery systems (the “LungFit® platform”) capable of generating NO from ambient air. Our first device, LungFit® PH received PMA approval from the FDA in June 2022. The NO generated by the LungFit® PH System is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. This condition is commonly referred to as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn or “PPHN”. The LungFit® platform can generate NO up to 400 parts per million (“ppm”) for delivery to a patient’s lungs directly or via a ventilator. LungFit® can deliver NO either continuously or for a fixed amount of time at various flow rates and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain a constant dose. LungFit® can be used to treat patients on ventilators that require NO, as well as patients with chronic or acute severe lung infections via delivery through a breathing mask or similar apparatus. Furthermore, we believe that there is a high unmet medical need for patients suffering from certain severe lung infections that the LungFit® platform can potentially address. Our current areas of focus with LungFit® are PPHN, community-acquired viral pneumonia (“CAVP”) including COVID-19, bronchiolitis (“BRO”), nontuberculous mycobacteria (“NTM”) lung infection and those with various severe lung infections with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). The Company’s current product candidates will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by the FDA, certification through the conduct of a conformity assessment by a notified body in the EU for the product to be CE marked, as well as comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The Company’s system will be marketed as a medical device in the U.S.
 
An additional program of Beyond Air targets solid tumors, through our majority-owned affiliate Beyond Cancer, Ltd. (“Beyond Cancer”). The LungFit® platform is not utilized for the solid tumor indication due to need for ultra-high concentrations of gaseous nitric oxide (“UNO”). A proprietary delivery system has been developed that can safely deliver UNO in excess of 10,000 ppm directly to a solid tumor. This program has advanced to phase 1 as enrollment is underway in the first human study.

LungFit® PH is the first FDA approved system using our patented ionizer technology to generate on-demand nitric oxide from ambient air and, regardless of dose or flow, deliver it to a ventilator circuit. The device uses a medical air compressor to drive room air through a plasma chamber in the center of the unit where pulses of electrical discharge are created between two electrodes. The system uses the power equivalent to a 60-watt lightbulb to ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules, which then combine as NO with low levels of nitrogen dioxide (“NO2”) created as a byproduct. The products are then passed through a Smart Filter, which removes the toxic NO2 from the internal circuit. With respect to PPHN, the novel LungFit® PH is designed to deliver a dosage of NO to the lungs that is consistent with current guidelines for delivery of 20 ppm NO with a range of 0.5 ppm – 80 ppm (low concentration NO) for ventilated patients.
 
We believe the ability of LungFit® PH to generate NO from ambient air provides us with many competitive advantages over the current standard of NO delivery systems in the U.S., the E.U., Japan and other markets. For example, LungFit® PH does not require the use of a high-pressure cylinder, does not require cumbersome purging procedures and places less burden on hospital staff in carrying out safety procedures.
 
Our novel LungFit® platform can also deliver a high concentration (>150 ppm) of NO directly to the lungs, which we believe has the potential to eliminate microbial infections including bacteria, fungi and viruses, among others. We believe that current FDA-approved NO vasodilation treatments would have limited success in treating microbial infections given the low concentrations of NO being delivered (<100 ppm). Given that NO is produced naturally by the body as an innate immunity mechanism, at a concentration of 200 ppm, supplemental high dose NO should aid in the body’s fight against infection. Based on our preclinical and clinical studies, we believe that 150 ppm is the minimum therapeutic dose to achieve the desired pulmonary antimicrobial effect of NO. To date, neither the FDA nor comparable foreign regulatory agencies in other countries or regions have approved any NO formulation and/or delivery system for >80 ppm NO.
 
LungFit® PH for the treatment of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN)
 
In June 2022 the FDA approved LungFit® PH to treat PPHN. LungFit® PH is the inaugural device from the LungFit® platform of NO generators that use patented ionizer technology and is the first FDA-approved product for Beyond Air.
 
We also expect to receive the CE Mark under the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in the E.U. in the second half of calendar year 2022. According to the most recent year-end report from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, sales of NO were $448.5 million in 2021 (down from $574.1 million in 2020) for the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Australia, with ~90% in the United States. Outside of the U.S. there are multiple market participants which translates to considerably lower sales than in the U.S. We believe the U.S. sales potential of LungFit® PH in PPHN to be greater than $400 million and worldwide sales potential to be greater than $700 million. We initiated the first phase of our commercial launch in June 2022 in the U.S. and will continue to work toward a potential launch in the EU and globally in 2022 and beyond.
 
LungFit® PRO for the treatment of viral lung infections in hospitalized patients

Community-Acquired Viral Pneumonia (including COVID-19)
 
Viral pneumonia in adults is most commonly caused by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”) and influenza virus. However, newly emerging viruses (including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza A, and H1N1 viruses) have been identified as pathogens contributing to the overall burden of adult viral pneumonia. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, that has resulted in a global pandemic, causing over 6.6 million hospitalizations and over 5 million deaths worldwide as of November 2021. Excluding the pandemic, there are approximately 350,000 annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations in the US, and up to 16 million annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations globally. For the broader annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations, we believe U.S. market potential to be greater than $1.5 billion and worldwide market potential to be greater than $3 billion.
 
We initiated a pilot study in late 2020 using our novel LungFit® PRO system at 150 ppm to treat patients with CAVP. The trial is a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial in Israel, including patients infected with COVID-19. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhalations of 150 ppm NO given intermittently for 40 minutes four times per day for up to seven days in addition to standard supportive treatment (“NO+SST”) or standard supportive treatment alone (“SST”). Endpoints related to safety (primary endpoint), oxygen saturation and ICU admission, among others, were assessed.

We reported interim data from this trial at the American Thoracic Society or ATS International Conference 2021, which was held virtually from May 14, 2021 through May 19, 2021. At the time of the data cut off, the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) analysis population included 19 COVID-19 patients (9 NO + SST vs 10 SST). The data readout showed that 150 ppm NO treatment administered via LungFit® PRO was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging efficacy signals. From a safety perspective, there were no treatment-related, or possibly related, adverse events or severe adverse events. NO2 levels were below 4 ppm at all timepoints (trial safety threshold is 5 ppm) and methemoglobin (“MetHb”) levels were below 4% at all times (trial safety threshold is 10%). With respect to the requirement of oxygen support beyond hospital stay, 22.2% of subjects in the NO + SST group compared with 40% of control subjects had this requirement. There was an observable trend of shortening the duration of hospital stay and duration on oxygen support for treated patients. The pilot study in adult viral pneumonia, including COVID-19, remained active with trial sites open for enrollment after these data were presented.
 
We presented additional detailed study results at the 32nd European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID 2022), which took place from April 23, 2022 through April 26, 2022 as a hybrid event both onsite in Lisbon, Portugal and online. At the time of the data cut off, the trial enrolled a total of 40 subject hospitalized for CAVP (SARS-CoV-2, n=39; other viruses n=1). The ITT population included 35 subjects with 16 in the inhaled NO group and 19 in the control group. Safety data from the study showed that inhaled NO treatment was well tolerated overall with no treatment related adverse events as assessed by the investigators. NO2 levels were below 4.4 ppm at all timepoints (trial safety threshold is 5 ppm) and MetHb levels were below 6.8% at all times (trial safety threshold is 10%). There were two SAEs reported in the group receiving inhaled NO along with SST, which were determined to be related to underlying conditions and unrelated to study drug/device. From an efficacy perspective, results showed a trend of shortening length of stay (“LOS”) in favor of the inhaled NO treatment group by a factor 1.8 in favor of inhaled NO treatment. Duration of oxygen support, measured in-hospital and at home, was significantly shorter (p=0.0339) for inhaled NO treated subjects. In addition, of subjects with unstable oxygen saturation during hospitalization, 66.7% of the inhaled NO treatment group reached stable saturation of ≥93% during hospital stay as compared to 26.7% in the SST group.
 
Bronchiolitis (BRO)
 
Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be 150 million new cases a year worldwide, with 2-3% (over 3 million) of them severe enough to require hospitalization. Worldwide, 95%3 of all cases occur in developing countries. In the U.S., there are approximately 120,000 annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations and approximately 3.2 million annual child hospitalizations globally. Currently, there is no approved treatment for bronchiolitis. The treatment for acute viral lung infections that cause bronchiolitis in infants is largely supportive care and is based primarily on prolonged hospitalization during which the infant receives a constant flow of oxygen to treat hypoxemia, a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. In addition, systemic steroids and inhalation with bronchodilators are sometimes utilized until recovery, but we believe that these treatments do not successfully reduce hospital length of stay. We believe the U.S. market potential for bronchiolitis to be greater than $500 million and worldwide market potential to be greater than $1.2 billion.
 
Our BRO program is currently on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivotal study for bronchiolitis was originally set to be performed in the winter of 2020/21 but was delayed due to the pandemic. We have completed three successful pilot studies for bronchiolitis. A further analysis of the three previously reported pilot studies was presented at the ATS International Conference 2021, which was held virtually from May 14, 2021 through May 19, 2021. Analysis across the studies (n=198 infants, mean age 3.9 months) showed that 150 ppm – 160 ppm NO administered intermittently was generally safe and well tolerated with adverse event rates similar among treatment groups with no reported treatment-related serious adverse events. The short course of treatments with intermittent high concentration inhaled NO was effective in shortening hospital length of stay and accelerating time to fit for discharge – a composite endpoint of clinical signs and symptoms to indicate readiness to be evaluated for hospital discharge. This treatment was also effective in accelerating time to stable oxygen saturation – measured as SpO2 ≥ 92% in room air. Additionally, NO at a dose of 85 ppm NO showed no difference compared to control for all efficacy endpoints, while 150 ppm NO showed statistical significance when compared to control.

Additionally, long-term safety data for high concentration inhaled NO in bronchiolitis was presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting 2022 (PAS 22), which was held in Denver, Colorado from April 21, 2022 through April 25, 2022. A total of 101 infants from the three prior pilot studies for bronchiolitis (n=198) participated in the long-term follow-up study. Study endpoints for the long-term safety study included percentage of subjects re-hospitalized for bronchiolitis related reasons, such reasons included wheezing episodes, pneumonia, asthma, etc., and the percentage of subjects re-hospitalized for any reason. Data from the study showed the re-hospitalization rate per 100 Patient Exposure Years (PEY) due to bronchiolitis related reasons trended favorably for the inhaled NO group. In addition, the long-term subject re-hospitalization rate for any reason was similar between inhaled NO and control groups. As such, the study concluded that the treatment of hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis by intermittent high dose inhaled NO show a favorable long-term safety profile.
 
We believe that the entirety of data at 150 ppm - 160 ppm NO in both adult and infant patient populations supports further development of LungFit® PRO in a pivotal study for patients hospitalized with CAVP or bronchiolitis.
 
LungFit® GO for the treatment of Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
 
NTM lung infection is a rare and serious pulmonary disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with NTM lung disease may experience a multitude of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, cough, lack of appetite, night sweats, blood in the sputum and fatigue. Patients with NTM lung disease, specifically Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) representing 20% - 25% of all NTM and other forms of NTM that are refractory to antibiotic therapy, frequently require lengthy and repeated hospital stays to manage their condition. There are no treatments specifically indicated for the treatment of M. abscessus lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan.
 
There are approximately 50,000 to 90,000 people with NTM infections in the U.S. In Asia, the number of patients suffering from NTM surpasses what is seen in the U.S. There is one inhaled antibiotic approved for the treatment of refractory Mycobacterium avium complex (“MAC”). Current guideline-based approaches to treat NTM lung disease involve multi-drug regimens of antibiotics that may cause severe, long lasting side effects, and treatment can be as long as 18 months or more. Median survival for NTM MAC patients is approximately 13 years while median survival for patients with other variations of NTM is typically 4.6 years. The prevalence of human disease attributable to NTM has increased over the past two decades. In a study conducted between 2007 and 2016, researchers found that the prevalence of NTM in the U.S. is increasing at approximately 7.5% per year. M. abscessus treatment costs are estimated to be more than double that of MAC. In total, a 2015 publication by co-authors from several U.S. government departments stated that annual cases in 2014 cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion. For this indication, we believe U.S. sales potential to be greater than $1 billion and worldwide sales potential to be greater than $2.5 billion.
 
In December 2020 we began a 12-week, multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia intended to enroll approximately 20 adult patients with chronic refractory NTM lung disease. We received a grant of up to $2.17 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”) to fund this study and advance the clinical development of inhaled NO to treat NTM pulmonary disease. The trial is enrolling both cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and non-CF patients infected with MAC, M. abscessus or any strain of NTM. The study consists of a run-in period followed by two treatment phases. The run-in period provides a baseline for the efficacy endpoints. The first treatment phase takes place over a two-week period and begins in the hospital setting where patients will be titrated from 150 ppm NO up to 250 ppm NO over several days. During this phase patients receive NO for 40 minutes, four times per day while MetHb levels are monitored. Patients are also trained to use LungFit® GO and subsequently discharged to complete the remaining portion of the two-week treatment period at their home at the highest tolerated NO concentration. For the second treatment phase, a 10-week maintenance phase, the administration is twice daily. The study is evaluating safety, quality of life, physical function, and bacterial load among other parameters.
 
We reported positive interim results in October 2021. At the time of data cutoff on September 6, 2021, eight subjects were successfully titrated up to 250 ppm NO in the hospital setting, and none required dose reductions during the subsequent at-home portion of the study. The mean age of subjects was 56.6 years (range: 22 – 73 years) with the majority female (87.5%), a distribution consistent with real-world NTM disease, and occurring at a higher rate in older adult women than men. 250 ppm NO was well-tolerated in all subjects with no study discontinuations or treatment-related serious adverse events observed. Methemoglobin and NO2 concentrations remained within acceptable ranges in all subjects during NO treatment, and below the safety thresholds of 10% and 5 ppm, respectively.

We reported additional positive interim results at the American Thoracic Society International Conference 2022 (ATS 2022), which was held in San Francisco from May 13, 2022 through May 18, 2022. At the time of data cutoff on April 4, 2022, a total of 15 subjects were enrolled in the pilot study. The mean age of subjects was 62.1 years (range: 22–82 years) with the majority female (80%), a distribution consistent with real-world NTM disease. The data show that high concentration inhaled NO was well tolerated following a total of 2,323 inhalations self-administered at home with no treatment related discontinuations reported and overall high treatment compliance. All 15 subjects were successfully titrated to 250 ppm NO in the hospital setting, and none have required dose reductions during the subsequent at-home portion of the study. Methemoglobin and NO2 concentrations remained within acceptable ranges in all subjects during NO treatment, below the safety thresholds of 10% and 5 ppm, respectively. Patients are followed up for 12 weeks after the 12-week treatment period is completed and the last patient visit at the end of week 24 is expected to occur in August 2022. The totality of the data will be used to evaluate efficacy measures, including quality of life, physical function, and sputum bacteria as compared to baseline measurements. The study is no longer enrolling patients, and we anticipate reporting the complete efficacy and safety results later in calendar year 2022. If the trial is successful, we would anticipate commencing a pivotal study in calendar year 2024.
 
Our program in COPD is in the preclinical stage and, subject to obtaining additional financing, is expected to enter clinical trials in calendar year 2023.

UNO has shown anticancer properties in preclinical trials by eliciting an immune response from the host. We have released this preclinical data at several medical/scientific conferences showing the promise of delivering NO at concentrations of 20,000 ppm – 200,000 ppm directly to tumors. Results showed that local tumor ablation with NO conveyed anti-tumor immunity to the host. We recently presented new in vivo and in vitro preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting 2022. The in vivo study assessed the mode of action following a single 5-minute gaseous NO (“gNO”) treatment provided data showing an effect on the primary tumor 14 days post treatment. These data showed that intratumoral injections of concentrations of gNO at 20,000 and 50,000 ppm led to increased recruitment of T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendrocytes to the primary tumor. An elevated number of T cells and B cells were also detected in the spleen and blood 21 days following gNO treatment. In addition, at the same timepoint, a marked reduction in the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells was seen in the spleen. Results from the in vitro study showed that exposure of six different cancer cell lines – including human ovarian and pancreatic and mouse lung, melanoma, colon, and breast– to ultra-high concentrations of gNO ranging from 10,000 ppm to 100,000 ppm for up to 10 minutes resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic response. The higher concentration doses of gNO lead to near instant cell death, while the lower concentration doses required a longer exposure period to elicit cell death. Cell viability was assessed using two assays: XTT and clonogenic assay. After one minute of exposure to 25,000 ppm gNO, less than 10% viability was observed in all cell lines.

COVID-19
 
The development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our approved product could be further disrupted and adversely affected by a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced significant delays in the supply chain for the LungFit® system due to the redundancy in parts and suppliers for ventilator manufacturing which has since been remedied. We continuously assess the impact that COVID-19 may have on our business plans and our ability to conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as on our reliance on third-party manufacturing and our supply chain. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid part or all of any impact from COVID-19 or its consequences if a resurgence occurs.
 
Background and NO Mechanism of Action
 
NO is recognized as a vital molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. NO is naturally produced by the body’s immune system to provide a first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is a powerful molecule with a short half-life of a few seconds in the blood, enabling it to be cleared rapidly from the body. NO has been shown to play a critical role in the function of several body systems. For example, as vasodilator of smooth muscles, NO enhances blood flow and circulation. In addition, NO is involved in regulation of a wound healing and immune responses to infection. The pharmacology, toxicity and other data for NO in humans is generally well known, and its use has been approved by the FDA as a vasodilator. The precise effect of inhaled NO is dependent on concentration, oxidation state and type of pathogen.
 
NO has multiple immunoregulatory and antimicrobial functions that are likely to be of relevance to inhaled NO therapy. In vitro studies suggest that NO possesses anti-microbial activity against common bacteria, gram positive and gram negative, as well as mycobacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites and helminths. It has the potential to eliminate multi-drug resistant strains of the above. Anti-viral activity covers respiratory viruses such as influenza, corona viruses, RSV and others. In healthy humans, NO has been shown to stimulate mucociliary clearance, and low levels of nasal NO correlate with impaired mucociliary function in the human upper airway. Unlike other inhaled drugs, NO is also a smooth muscle relaxant and avoids the concomitant bronchial constriction often associated with inhaled antibiotics and mucolytics. A potential benefit of these multiple mechanisms may be that in addition to treating lung infections in CF patients, this suggests that NO may be useful in directly treating the mucus caused by CF, which is the principal manifestation of the disease.
 
Nitric Oxide and Infection
 
NO possesses broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity acting against bacteria, fungi and viruses. NO is produced at high output as part of the innate immune response. NO and its by-products (for example, reactive nitrogen species, or RNS) are responsible for the process of killing microorganisms within white blood cells called macrophages and in organs such as the lungs and other mucolytic tissues.

More than a decade ago, several research groups showed that NO and RNS possess anti-viral activity and affect several viruses including coxsackievirus, RSV, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, coronavirus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, and others. NO has also been shown to be useful in preventing bacterial growth on surfaces.
 
Continuous exposure to 150 ppm NO and above, especially in the lungs, may have side effects and cause damage to host cells. Intermittent exposure to NO in cycles retains NO anti-microbial activity both in vitro and in animal model of infection. Exposure of bacteria to concomitant 30-minute treatments with 160 ppm NO resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial load. A similar dose has been shown to reduce viruses (common influenza) by 30-100% in a canine kidney infection model. In vivo, in a pneumonia model in rats, inhaled 160 ppm NO, for 30 minutes, every 4 hours, resulted in significant reduction in bacteria counts in the lungs, without affecting the body’s defense mechanisms, and without any other adverse effect. In addition, we believe a daily dose of 160 ppm of NO can treat bovine respiratory disease (“BRD”) in cattle.
 
Importantly, several studies report synergy between NO and antibiotic drugs. Adjunctive treatment combining NO together with inhaled tobramycin antibiotics or other anti-microbial agents has been shown to greatly enhance the efficacy of the antibiotics in dispersing P. aeruginosa biofilms and to increase their ability to elicit anti-microbial activity. These studies suggest that adjuvant treatment combining NO with antibiotics might have a beneficial role by reducing bacterial infectivity, and therefore reduce the dependency on antibiotics.
 
Beyond Air Technology
 
We have developed the Beyond Air nitric oxide generator and delivery system which we call LungFit®, a novel and precise delivery system that uses NO generated from ambient air with a novel NO generator, the ionizer. Our system provides continuous monitoring and control of the gaseous content administered during intermittent and continuous NO inhalation treatments, as well as a precise and reliable monitoring system that is able to monitor patient status and alert medical staff to any adverse effects.
 
The LungFit® system is innovatively designed to provide patients with a gaseous dose of NO (ranging from 0.5 ppm up to 400 ppm) combined with ambient air. The gaseous blend is supplied to the patient via a ventilator, face mask, or similar apparatus. LungFit® is designed to minimize the time that NO is mixed with oxygen and air. The system is also designed to continuously monitor inhaled NO concentration, NO2 concentration and oxygen. A dedicated screen allows for monitoring of the gas mixture. Further, our approved product and product candidates resemble other inhalation systems, making them user friendly, with operation and maintenance that we believe will be immediately familiar to medical staff. Our LungFit® system has been manufactured at commercial scale with a contract manufacturer.
 
When programmed for lung infections, the LungFit®, is designed to specifically deliver a NO dosage of 150 ppm and higher. We believe that the LungFit® has a number of advantages over other NO formulation delivery systems. For example, it is:
 

● | optimized to deliver 150 ppm and higher of NO, whereas existing NO delivery systems on the market consist of a maximum deliverable NO concentration of 80 ppm; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | equipped with a monitoring system that continuously monitors system parameters (e.g., NO, NO2 and inhaled fraction of inspired oxygen (“FiO2”) concentrations); 
● | capable of providing constant flow of NO, which we believe allows it to adequately cover the surface area of the lung to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes; 
● | programmable and able to deliver different dosage regimens for a wide range of lung infections; 
● | able to generate NO from ambient air, eliminating the need for the use of high-pressure cylinders; 
● | designed to be used by the patient, thus convenient and portable; and 
● | administered non-invasively through a facial mask, which has the potential to address severe infections in large, underserved chronic-care markets, such as CF and COPD.

We believe that our solution has the potential for a number of additional benefits and opportunities, as follows:
 

● | The antimicrobial and multiple other properties of the NO molecule delivered to the lungs suggest the potential for application in a wide range of respiratory diseases. In contrast to the often arduous and slow drug discovery process for small molecules, proteins, peptides, etc., the use of NO in medicine is well-known, and therefore the identification of conditions where NO provides benefits has been, and we expect will continue to be, much simpler, quicker and less costly. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The FDA approved the use of NO as an inhaled drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in newborns in 1999. More than 20 years of clinical experience in the delivery, monitoring and understanding of NO in the clinical environment for vascular uses has been documented. 
● | NO is naturally produced by the immune system and acts as a first line of defense against infectious diseases. We believe therapeutic use of NO for viral and bacterial co-infections would potentially improve the success of antimicrobial and anti-viral treatments by mimicking the body’s natural defense mechanism and thereby directly reduce viral infectivity, as well as antibiotic drug resistant bacteria. 
● | NO is used naturally by the body for vasodilation and we believe that the benefits to patients with various medical conditions will be seen via vasodilation when delivered with our system. 

 
NitricGen License
 
On January 31, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a global, exclusive, perpetual, transferable license to the eNOGenerator and associated critical assets including intellectual property, know-how, trade secrets and confidential information (the “License”) from NitricGen Inc. (“NitricGen”). The eNOGenerator is a novel and precise delivery system that uses NO generated from ambient air with a novel NO generator.
 
The Beyond Air LungFit® system, which incorporates the eNOGenerator, has been designated as a medical device by the FDA. The eNOGenerator can generate NO on demand for delivery to the lungs at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 400 ppm. With the License, we expect that we will be able to target all conditions requiring NO at any concentration, regardless of the need for intermittent or continuous dosing.
 
Under the terms of the License, we agreed to pay NitricGen an aggregate of $2 million in up-front, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments, with the majority pertaining to regulatory milestones, as well as royalties on net sales of the delivery system containing the eNOGenerator at a percentage in the low-single digits. As partial consideration for the License, we issued to NitricGen warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.90 per share. To date, $200 thousand has been paid for milestones that were earned. The next milestone of $1.5 million became due to NitricGen upon approval by the FDA and is now payable within the next six months of the triggering event.
 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Agreement
 
On February 10, 2021 we received a grant for up to $2.17 million from the CFF to advance the clinical development of high concentration NO for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease, which disproportionally affects CF patients. Under the terms of the agreement, the funding will be allocated to the ongoing LungFit® GO NTM pilot study. The Company met the second milestone and received a reimbursement of $425 thousand in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The reimbursement was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2022.

Strategies
 
Our objective is to build a leading medical device and biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes patented and proprietary products for the treatment of respiratory infections and diseases, with an initial focus on the treatment of PPHN, AVP, BRO, NTM and severe infections in COPD patients, among others. Additionally, we are exploring the effects of NO on solid tumors. If our clinical trials for our product candidates are successful, we expect to seek certification or marketing approval from the FDA and other worldwide authorities and notified regulatory bodies.
Our Clinical Results to Date
 
We have conducted several clinical trials to assess our ≥ 150 ppm NO inhalation-treatment in various indications. These trials include:

Cystic Fibrosis and NTM Clinical Development
 
In 2011, a prospective, open label, controlled, single-center pilot safety study was conducted on ten healthy adults between 20 and 62 years of age. The data were published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis in 2012. Subjects received 160 ppm NO for 30 minutes, five times a day, for five consecutive days via direct inhalation to the lungs using a prototype delivery system. The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of inhaled 160 ppm NO on pulmonary function tests and characterize the relationship between high-concentration NO administration and MetHb – a form of hemoglobin that is a biproduct of NO and hemoglobin that cannot bind oxygen – and establish a MetHb safety threshold level to assess adverse events associated with the treatment. Secondary objectives of the study were to assess the changes in cytokine levels. Multiple safety markers were continuously monitored including: NO levels, NO2 (a biproduct of NO and O2 that can be toxic at high concentrations), FiO2, as well as MetHb and oxygen saturation (“SaO2”). Vital signs, lung function, blood chemistry (including nitrite/nitrates), hematology, prothrombin time, inflammatory cytokine/chemokines levels and endothelial activation (angiopoietin ratio) were also closely monitored. All individuals tolerated the NO formulation treatment courses well. No significant adverse events occurred. The maximum amount of air one can forcefully exhale in one second, known as forced expiratory volume in one second (“FEV1”) and other lung function parameters, serum nitrites/nitrates, prothrombin, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels did not differ between baseline and day five, while MetHb increased during the study period by an average of 0.9%, as expected. These data suggest that inhalation of 160 ppm NO for 30 minutes, five times a day, for five consecutive days is well tolerated in healthy individuals.
 
In 2014, we completed a pilot open label, multi-center study in nine CF patients (≥10 years old). Patients received intermittent (30 minutes, three times a day) inhalation of 160 ppm NO formulation, five days a week, over a two-week period. The study was performed in two centers, Soroka Medical Center and Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel. The primary endpoints of the study were to determine the MetHb percentage, adverse events associated with inhaled NO and the percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study due to adverse events (“AEs”) and/or severe adverse events (“SAEs”), or for any other reason. AEs were reported by five (55.5%) subjects. There were no SAEs related to NO therapy, no treatment-related withdrawals due to AEs, and no deaths. AEs considered by the investigator as possibly or probably related to treatment were reported for two (22.2%) subjects. There were no AEs of MetHb elevation >5% or NO 2 elevation >5 ppm (study safety threshold of MetHb and NO2, respectively). In total, seven cases of hemoptysis were reported in two subjects and all events were mild in severity. There was no cumulative effect of MetHb exposure during the study. The maximum MetHb level reported was 4.6%. Several secondary efficacy analyses were conducted in this study, and though the study was not powered for efficacy, results show various positive effects of the treatment regime. Bacterial and fungal sputum load analysis results were highly variable, though marked reductions of MSSA, Achromabacter, P. aeruginosa, and Aspergillus were seen in several subjects. These results suggest non-specific targeting of bacteria and fungi that commonly manifest in CF patients. In subjects with systemic inflammation (CRP >5 mg/mL) at baseline, CRP levels decreased over the treatment period, showing the effect of NO in the reduction of systemic inflammation. There were no statistically significant or clinically relevant changes in FEV1 over time, and lung function indices also remained relatively constant throughout the study duration.
 
In 2016, Rambam healthcare campus in Israel conducted a compassionate use treatment for two patients with CF who suffer from M, abscessus lung infections. The data were published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal in 2017. The NO treatment regime, as well as the device for this treatment, was supplied by BA Ltd. our wholly owned subsidiary. Patients received intermittent 30-minute treatments of 160 ppm NO, with two different regimes including hospitalization (5 times a day) and ambulatory treatment (2-3 inhalations a day). Treatment was well tolerated with no evidence of any serious side effects. We observed significant improvement in sputum production (up to 5-10 time more sputum), and subjective improvement in the well-being of both patients. Significant reduction in systemic inflammation was observed in the first patient, as observed by reduction of CRP (C-reactive protein, a systemic inflammation marker that rises in response to inflammation) levels during treatment. In addition, the first patient had a 2 log (100-fold) reduction in M. abscessus during treatment (an effect that was lost after the treatment regime changed to ambulatory). The second patient showed a significant increase in the 6-minute walk (“6MW”) test and the sputum culture became negative, which is consistent with eradication of M. abscessus. Further information is needed, but we believe these results suggest that the treatment of M. abscessus with high-concentration inhaled NO is effective.

In 2017, we treated one patient with CF who suffered from NTM infections (specifically, M. abscessus) under compassionate use in the United Sates at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute with our generator based NO delivery system. The patient saw improvements in 6MW, FEV1, most Quality of Life measures and had no SAEs. The bacteria was not eradicated. The patient requested to be treated again and this treatment was commenced in February 2018. A total of 38 treatments were administered over 8 days, 29 of them at a concentration of 240 ppm, with no SAEs believed to be related to NO reported.
 
Additionally in 2017, we completed a single-arm, open-label Pilot trial in nine patients with M. abcessus lung disease, who were refractory to standard-of-care. The patients were treated with inhaled NO at a concentration of 160 ppm for 30 minutes, in addition to treatment with standard-of-care. Our inhaled NO treatment was administered intermittently five times per day over a 14-day period, followed by a seven-day period with three treatments per day. The primary endpoint of safety, as measured by NO-related SAEs, over the 21-day treatment period was met with no SAEs reported. Secondary endpoints of a 6MW test FEV1, Quality of Life and M. abscessus load in sputum all trended positively. 6MW showed an increase of >40 meters at the end of treatment at day 21 versus baseline and an increase of >25 meters on day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy). The mean percentage change in FEV1 at day 21 and day 51 (30 days after the cessation of treatment) was > 3.5% with FEV1 returning to baseline at day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy). At day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy) bacterial load was 65% lower than baseline. 1 of 9 patients saw culture conversion. This study was published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis in 2019.
 
In 2018, an additional CF patient infected with M. abscessus was treated over a 4-week period with 76 of 84 treatments at 250 ppm NO in Israel at Soroka Medical Center. The patient saw improvements in 6MW, FEV1 and most Quality of Life measures. The bacteria was not eradicated. Importantly, there were no SAE’s reported and all treatments were completed without incident.
 
CAVP and BRO Clinical Development
 
In 2014, we completed a double blind, randomized Pilot study for infants with bronchiolitis (n=43) for which the data were published in the Pediatric Pulmonology Journal in 2017. The study was performed at Soroka University Medical Center in Israel. Forty-three infants between the ages of two to 12 months diagnosed with bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group comprised 21 subjects who received intermittent (30 minutes, five times a day) inhalation of 160 ppm NO formulation, in addition to supportive O2 treatment for up to five days. The control group, 22 subjects, received ongoing inhalation of the supportive O2 treatment. Primary endpoints included determination of the MetHb levels, adverse events associated with the inhaled NO formulation and proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study. Baseline clinical score, indicating disease severity at screening, was similar between treatment groups (~8). Results were encouraging, with similar overall incidence of AEs between the treatment groups. Out of 43 patients, 39 (~90%) completed the study per protocol (“PP”), with similar percentages (90%) for both the control and the treatment groups, individually. Only one subject from the treatment group discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, namely – repeated MetHb levels above 5%. Adverse events were reported by 23 (53.5%) subjects overall, with ten (47.6%) subjects in the NO group reporting a total of 22 AEs, and 13 (59.1%) subjects in the control group reporting a total of 22 AEs. Serious adverse events were reported by four (19.0%) subjects in the NO group and four (18.2%) in the standard treatment group. There were no treatment-related SAEs in the NO treatment group.
 
In the NO group, six (28.6%) subjects had any MetHb measurement >5% during the study treatment period, and three of these subjects had more than one MetHb >5%. The maximum MetHb level was 5.6% in one subject in the NO group. There was no cumulative effect of MetHb exposure during the study. The MetHb levels in this study were defined to <5% as a safety measure, though previous findings have shown that higher levels (6.4%) are non-toxic in children. Secondary and exploratory analyses were performed, and results show positive impact of the treatment regime. In a subgroup of subjects that stayed at the hospital at least 24 hours (Length of Stay (“LOS”) >24 hours), a statistically significant treatment benefit of NO versus standard treatment was demonstrated. Mean results for subjects with LOS > 24 hours show that LOS was shortened by approximately 34% in the NO group compared to the standard treatment group, with a one-day difference between the groups (PP, N=24). Time to normal oxygenation ((SaO2 of 92%) was shortened by approximately 44% (27.75 hours) in the NO group compared to the standard treatment group (PP, N=24). An 80% improvement in time to clinical score (indicating improvement in disease severity) and time to normal oxygenation (92%) was observed in favor of the NO group (PP, N=24).

In 2018 we completed a second pilot study in bronchiolitis in 6 centers in Israel. The data were published in Nature in 2020. The prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled pilot study enrolled 67 patients, aged 0-12 months, who were hospitalized due to bronchiolitis. The patients received either standard of care (“SOC”) (typically oxygen and hydration) or SOC plus inhaled NO at a concentration of 160 ppm for 30 minutes 5 times per day for up to 5 days. The primary endpoint of hospital LOS was met with a 26.7-hour reduction in hospital length of stay demonstrated (p=0.04). Secondary endpoints of time required to achieve a clinical score of 5 or less on the modified Tal score and time required to achieve oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92% or greater showed improvement versus the standard-of-care. There were no issues with NO2 or MetHb and no SAEs were recorded.
 
In 2020 we completed a third pilot study in bronchiolitis in 8 centers in Israel and presented the data at CHEST Annual Meeting 2020. The prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled pilot study enrolled 89 patients (ITT n=87), aged 0-12 months, who were hospitalized due to bronchiolitis. The patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either SOC (typically oxygen and hydration) or SOC plus inhaled NO at 85 ppm or SOC plus inhaled NO at 150 ppm for 40 minutes 4 times per day for up to 5 days. There were no SAEs related to NO therapy. Efficacy results are shown in the table below.
 

 | 150 ppm vs. 85 ppm Hazard Ratio (p-value) | 150 ppm vs. SST Hazard Ratio (p-value) 
----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fit for Discharge | 2.11 (0.041) | 2.32 (0.049) 
Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) | 2.01 (0.046) | 2.28 (0.043) 
Oxygen Saturation of > 92% | 2.15 (0.056) | 2.62 (0.039) 

 
We plan to seek certification or regulatory approval for our remaining current product candidates and, if approved, we expect they will be marketed as medical devices.
 
If we reach the commercialization stage for any of our remaining product candidates, we expect that we will collaborate with companies outside the U.S. for all indications. We are still determining whether to attempt to collaborate for any indication in the U.S. We are commercializing LungFit® PH for PPHN in the U.S. ourselves and expect to partner with third-parties to commercialize LungFit® PH outside the U.S.
 
Our Pre-Clinical Results to Date
 
We have completed 4 separate toxicology studies in animals.
 

● | Rats: 30 days of intermittent treatments with LungFit® at 400 ppm NO showed no observations (differences) between control rats and treated rats on observation during the treatment period prior to sacrifice and no observations on histopathology 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
The biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our approved product or product candidates. We are aware of several companies currently developing and selling NO therapies for various indications such as pulmonary hypertension. For example, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (“Mallinckrodt”) commercializes INOMAX® (nitric oxide) for inhalation, which is approved for use to treat newborns suffering from HRF-PPHN, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Mexico and Japan. Praxair markets a generic version of the Mallinckrodt offering with their delivery system called NOxBOX®, acquired from Bedfont, in the United States. The Linde Group has marketing rights to INOMAX® in Europe. Air Liquide sells a similar product in Europe, called VasoKINOX™, together with their delivery platform called OptiKINOX™, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension that occurs during or after heart surgery. In Europe, Bedfont Scientific Ltd. has a delivery system called NOxBOX® and Air Products PLC has a gas product called NOXAP®, each used in delivering inhaled NO formulations. Bellerophon Therapeutics is developing NO-based products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) and pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD. VERO Biotech LLC (formerly known as Geno LLC) received FDA approval for their delivery system GENOSYL DS for PPHN in 2019. In addition, other companies may be developing generic NO formulation delivery systems for various dosages. Ceretec, Inc., a company affiliated with 12th Man Technologies Inc., recently obtained clearance from the FDA to market a NO gas product for use in membrane diffusing capacity testing in pulmonary function laboratories in the U.S. Novoteris, LLC previously received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the use of inhaled NO-based treatments in treating CF. SaNOtize has an NO nasal spray that has received approval in India for preventing COVID-19 after high-risk exposure. Third Pole has reported that they are developing a NO generator and delivery system for use in PPHN and PAH, but we are not aware of any display of any product at any medical/scientific conference in recent years. Our patents surrounding LungFit® have priority date over those of Third Pole.
 
Some of our competitors, either alone or through their strategic partners, might have substantially greater name recognition and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we do and greater experience and infrastructure in the research and clinical development of pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of those products and commercializing those products around the world.
 
We have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers, Spartronics LLC (“Spartronics”), and Medisize Ireland Limited (“Medisize”) who have completed a substantial portion of the commercial manufacturing process for our LungFit® PH system. In addition, we will be reliant on our partners for commercial manufacture of our systems for both clinical studies and commercial supply.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own or have exclusively licensed patents, pending patent applications, know-how and trade secrets that relate to our NO generator, NO2 filtration, delivery systems, devices configured for delivering NO to patients by inhalation, methods of exposing patients to inhalation of NO, and methods for treating subjects in need of NO inhalation.
 
In particular, we are party to a global, exclusive, transferable license agreement with NitricGen, Inc. for the eNOGenerator, its components, and all associated patents and know how related thereto. Additionally, we have a broad intellectual property portfolio directed to our product candidates and mode of delivery, monitoring parameters and methods of treating specific disease indications. Our intellectual property portfolio consists of issued patents and pending applications, which includes patents we acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option in 2017 granted to us by Pulmonox Technologies Corporation (“Pulmonox”).
 
CareFusion Non-Exclusive License Agreement. In October 2013, we entered into a non-exclusive worldwide license agreement with CareFusion, whereby we licensed seven issued U.S. patents and corresponding foreign counterparts. Our intellectual property licensed from CareFusion, for which the earliest expiring patent term was 2019 and the last to expire is 2025. The term of the agreement extends through the life of the patents and may be terminated by either party with 60 days’ prior written notice in the event of a breach of the agreement, and may be terminated unilaterally by CareFusion with 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that we do not meet certain milestones. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay CareFusion royalty payments of 5% of the net sales of a covered licensed product by the Company and an annual fee of $50 thousand, which is creditable against the royalty payments for the respective year.

Pulmonox Patents and Assets - Option to Acquire. On August 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Pulmonox (the “Option Agreement”) whereby we acquired the option to purchase certain intellectual property assets, including Pulmonox’s rights in 17 issued U.S. patents, including eight patents jointly owned with CareFusion which are directed to:
 

● | devices and methods for delivering NO formulations to a patient at steady and alternating concentrations (80-400 ppm), including intermittent delivery of NO; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a device and methods for treatment of surface infections; and 
● | use of NO as a mucolytic agent and for treatment and disinfection of biofilms. 

 
We exercised the Option in January 2017, acquiring Pulmonox’s rights in the patents described above. Upon exercise of the Option, we became obligated to make certain one-time development and sales milestone payments to Pulmonox, commencing with the date on which we receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of the first product candidate qualifying under the agreement. These milestone payments are almost entirely sales-related and are capped at a total of $87 million across three separate and distinct indications that fall under the agreement with the majority of them, approximately $83 million, being sales-related based on cumulative sales milestones for each of the three products. In addition, the Company issued a fully vested warrant to purchase up to 178,570 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.80 per share for each share of common stock. On May 10, 2018, we issued to Pulmonox, an additional fully vested warrant to purchase up to 29,763 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.80 per share.
 
Patent Applications. We have filed over 35 US and foreign patents and patent applications, including Patent Corporation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications.
 
A PCT patent application is a filing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty to which the U.S. and a number of other countries are a party. It provides a unified procedure for filing a single patent application to protect inventions in those countries. A search with respect to the application is conducted by the International Searching Authority, accompanied by a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention. A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, and the grant of patent is a prerogative of each national or regional authority where the PCT application is filed during national phase filings.
 
Settlement Agreement
 
On January 23, 2019, we entered into an agreement for commercial rights (the “Circassia Agreement”) with Circassia Limited and its affiliates (collectively, “Circassia”) for PPHN and future related indications at concentrations of < 80 ppm in the hospital setting in the United States and China. On December 18, 2019, we terminated the Circassia Agreement. Circassia contended that the termination was wrongful.
 
On May 25, 2021, we and Circassia Limited entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving all claims by and between both parties and mutually terminating the Circassia agreement disclosed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to pay Circassia $10.5 million in three installments, the first being a payment of $2.5 million to Circassia within fifteen (15) days following FDA approval of the LungFit® PH (the “Initial Payment Due Date”). Thereafter, we shall pay $3.5 million to Circassia on the first anniversary of the Initial Payment Due Date and $4.5 million on the second anniversary of the Initial Payment Due Date. Additionally, beginning in year three post-approval, Circassia will receive a quarterly royalty payment equal to 5% of LungFit® PH net sales in the U.S. This royalty will terminate once the aggregate payment reaches $6 million. $10.5 million was accrued as a liability as of March 31, 2022 when management deemed the approval of LungFit® PH by the FDA was probable. FDA approval was received on June 28, 2022.

Government Regulation
 
U.S. Regulation. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug and medical device products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act - The Act”), and its implementing regulations. Our products have been designated as devices by the FDA and will be regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Given that currently approved NO products and delivery systems were approved either separately (NO drug approval and NO delivery systems cleared as devices) or as drug-device combinations in the United States, we expect our device to not only be reviewed by CDRH, but also have input from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”).
 
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements for Medical Devices. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a de novo application, or approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application. Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
 
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
 
510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.
 
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

PMA Approval Pathway. Class III devices require approval of a PMA before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA application, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA application must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FFDCA to complete its review of a PMA application, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA devices are also subject to the payment of user fees.
 
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). A PMA may include post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported the PMA or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. None of our products are currently marketed pursuant to a PMA.
 
On November 10, 2020 we submitted a PMA application to the FDA for the use of LungFit® PH in PPHN and subsequently received PMA approval in June 2022.
 
De-Novo Pathway. Another pathway, known as de-novo down-classification also can be used for lower risk devices for which there is no existing product code or predicate device. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established the de-novo down-classification procedure as a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that automatically require a PMA due to the absence of a predicate device. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device automatically requires a PMA to request down-classification of its medical device (to allow clearance through the 510(k) pathway) on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Manufacturers can request de-novo down-classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a “not substantially equivalent” determination. Under this pathway, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de-novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.

Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE study, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 
Post-market Regulation. After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products; 
● | requirements related to promotional activities; 


23
--


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | medical device reporting regulations which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur. 
● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health; 
● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

 
The manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. These requirements impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers related to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, medical devices. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Following these inspections, the FDA may assert noncompliance with QSR requirements on a Form 483, which is a report of observations from an inspection, or by way of “untitled letters” or “warning letters” that could cause us or any third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities. A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated QSR or other FDA requirements. We cannot be certain that we or our present or any future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with QSR or other FDA regulatory requirements to the agency’s satisfaction. Failure to comply with these obligations may lead to possible legal or regulatory enforcement action by the FDA.
 
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 

● | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
● | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products; 
● | withdrawing a PMA that has already been granted; 
● | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
● | criminal prosecution. 

 
Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of medical devices, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications about unapproved uses, industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Devices may be marketed only for the approved or cleared indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved or cleared label.
 
Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe approved devices for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Thus, we may market our products, if approved by the FDA, only for their approved indications, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject us to adverse publicity and a variety of sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition.

Combination Products. A combination product is the combination of two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; packaged together in a single package or as a unit; or a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
 
To determine which FDA center or centers will review a combination product candidate submission, companies may submit a request for assignment to the FDA. Those requests may be handled formally or informally. In some cases, jurisdiction may be determined informally based on FDA experience with similar products. However, informal jurisdictional determinations are not binding on the FDA. Companies also may submit a formal Request for Designation to the FDA Office of Combination Products. The Office of Combination Products will review the request and make its jurisdictional determination within 60 days of receiving a Request for Designation.
 
FDA will determine which center or centers within the FDA will review the product candidate and under what legal authority the product candidate will be reviewed. Depending on how the FDA views the product candidates that are developed, the FDA may have aspects of the product candidate reviewed by CBER, CDRH, or CDER, though one center will be designated as the center with primary jurisdiction, based on the product candidate’s primary mode of action. The FDA determines the primary mode of action based on the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product candidate – the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product candidate. The review of such combination product candidates is often complex and time consuming, as the FDA may select the combination product candidate to be reviewed and regulated by one or multiple of the FDA centers identified above, which could affect the path to regulatory clearance or approval. Furthermore, the FDA may also require submission of separate applications to multiple centers.
 
The post-market requirements that apply to the cleared or approved product will largely be aligned with the agency center determined to have primary jurisdiction over the product candidate and that provided marketing authorization, but manufacturers must also comply with certain post-market requirements with respect to the constituent parts of combination products. In April 2019, FDA published a final guidance document entitled Compliance Policy for Combination Product Post-Marketing Safety Reporting, which is intended to assist manufacturers of combination products comply with reporting requirements applicable to such products.
 
After issuing marketing authorizations, the FDA has discretion in determining post-approval compliance requirements for combination products. The FDA has also promulgated regulations pertaining to compliance with certain current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements for drug components as well as QSR requirements for device constituents of a combination product. Other post-market requirements in the same vein as those described above for medical devices and drugs will also apply, depending on the application type and center overseeing regulation of the combination product, including:
 

● | Other record-keeping requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Post-market adverse event and Medical Device Reporting requirements; 
● | Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
● | Advertising and promotion requirements; 
● | Restrictions on sale, distribution or use of the product; 
● | Requirements for recalls being conducted and recall reporting; 
● | An order of repair, replacement or refund; 
● | Product tracking requirements; and 
● | Post-market surveillance or clinical trials.

Coverage and Reimbursement. Coverage and reimbursement for medical devices in the U.S. is determined by third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations. Each payor has a unique process for determining whether to cover a device for a particular indication and how to set reimbursement rates for the device. A payor can decide to cover a device yet not provide adequate reimbursement to ensure access to the device. New devices often face significant uncertainty about coverage and reimbursement. Payors may require additional evidence, beyond the data required for FDA approval, to demonstrate that a device should be covered for a particular indication or that it should be reimbursed at a higher rate than other technologies. In addition, health care spending continues to be a concern for federal and state governments, as well as for commercial payors. Governments continue to debate methods of controlling health care costs, including reductions in reimbursement or additional controls on utilization of new technologies in Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors may similarly seek to limit spending on new devices. Restrictions on coverage and reimbursement could harm our future revenues and ability to realize an appropriate return on our investment.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to products that are intended to treat rare diseases or conditions (i.e., those affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.), or diseases or conditions that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug product would be recovered from sales in the U.S. Although orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process, it can provide certain tax benefits and access to certain grants. Additionally, FDA user fees, which can be substantial, are waived for products that obtain orphan drug designation. Further, if a product with orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the designated disease or condition, the product is generally granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which (with certain limited exceptions) blocks for seven years FDA approval of another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. In addition to the FDA’s ongoing post-approval regulation of devices discussed above, manufacturers are also subject to several other types of laws and regulations, subject to differing enforcement regimes. In recent years, marketing and promotional activities regarding FDA-regulated products have come under intense scrutiny and have been the subject of enforcement action brought by the Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities and even private individuals.
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
 

● | The federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical or device manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers and others on the other. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to apply to anything of value including, for example, gifts, cash payments, donations, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical device products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational grants and reimbursement support programs. Violations are punishable by up to 10 years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Any sales or marketing practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny under the AKS;

● | the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent, claims for payment of government funds, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government, who may also share in any monetary recovery. Qui tam actions are filed under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Manufacturers have faced liability under the FCA for providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs;

● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPA”), imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; 
● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided (in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit certain sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to health care providers. 

 
Additionally, other laws such as the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws allow competitors and others to initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If we sell our device outside the United States, it must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and local laws of other countries. FCPA is a complex patchwork of laws can change rapidly with relatively short notice.

Environmental Laws. Elements of our potential products may be classified as hazardous materials, subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Association, the International Maritime Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which may impose various requirements pertaining to the way we manufacture, transport, store, handle and dispose of our products.
 
European Regulation of Medical Devices. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we expect our products to be regulated as a medical device product falling within the scope of EU MDR.
 
In the EEA, medical devices must currently comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU MDR. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark on products, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the EU MDR and obtain the right to affix the CE mark, medical devices manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), in relation to which the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body, which is an organization designated by a Competent Authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would audit and examine the technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The notified body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements. This Certificate and the related conformity assessment process entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. Notified bodies must be accredited by the EEA countries’ accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices in accordance with the EU MDR. There are currently a relatively small number of notified bodies that have been accredited to conduct these assessments. This may delay conformity assessment procedures in the future in the EU.
 
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the General Safety and Performance Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the Competent Authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.
 
The EU MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA countries, the regulations is directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA country laws implementing them, in all countries and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The EU MDR, among other things, establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensures a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU MDR entered into application on May 26, 2020, and among others things:
 

● | strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
● | improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
● | sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; 
● | strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.

Continuing Regulation. As in the U.S., manufacturers of medical devices are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by notified bodies and the competent authorities of the EEA countries. This oversight applies both before and after certification. It includes control of compliance with the EU MDR General Safety and Performance Requirements and post-market surveillance.
 
In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EEA countries national laws implementing Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation of individual EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EEA countries’ legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medical devices in the EEA could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.
 
Data Privacy Regulation. The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the data protection laws and regulations adopted by the EEA countries and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018 and repealed the EU Data Protection Directive. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EEA country and imposes several requirements on companies that process personal data, strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the U.S., and fines and penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EAA countries. The GDPR confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR may result in fines of up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
 
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity. In the European Union, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 
In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval. Orphan medicinal product or products for unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life- threatening diseases or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled.

Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually .
 
Other Regulations. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 
Regulation in Israel. In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in the State of Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations require authorization by the institutional ethics committee and general manager as well as from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and complex clinical trials, an additional authorization of the Ministry of Health’s overseeing ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since we perform a portion of the clinical studies on certain of our therapeutic candidates in Israel, we are required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we were an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted on April 5, 2012, referred to as the JOBS Act. For as long as were are an emerging growth company, we were able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” and “say-when-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.
 
The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may utilize the extended transition period provided for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We had irrevocably elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Because we were not required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with the effective dates of those accounting standards.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we remained an emerging growth company until March 31, 2022.

Human Capital
 
As of June 15, 2022, we had 70 employees globally, all of whom were full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
 
Our workforce is highly educated and diverse, which we believe is important for our continued success as a leading innovator in the medical device market. We employ a number of strategies to best enable us to attract, retain, and engage our team members. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and our clinical, scientific and other employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants.
