     Item 1 - Business
 Our Initial Public Offering and Reorganization Transactions
 PetIQ, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in February 2016. PetIQ Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PETQ.”  
     On July 26, 2017, we closed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 7,187,500 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, which includes 937,500 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option.  We received gross proceeds of approximately $115 million, part of which we used to purchase newly issued LLC interests from HoldCo  (“LLC Interests”) at a price per interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock of $16.00.  
     PetIQ is a holding company with no direct operations and our principal asset is the equity interest in PetIQ Holdings, LLC (“HoldCo”). In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of recapitalization transactions (collectively the “Reorganization Transactions”) including the following:       
· | We entered into the 6th Amended and Restated LLC agreement for HoldCo (the “HoldCo LLC Agreement”), to, among other things, modifiy the capital structure of HoldCo to (i) create a new single class LLC Interests, (ii) exchange all of the then existing LLC Interests of the holders of HoldCo’s LLC interests (“Continuing LLC Owners”) for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint PetIQ as the sole managing member of HoldCo.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The PetIQ certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) provide for Class A common stock and Class B common stock and (ii) issue shares of Class B common stock to the Continung LLC Owners on a one-to-one basis with the number of LLC Interests they own. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuant to a contribution agreement, each of ECP IV TS Investor Co., Eos TS Investor Co., and HCP-TS Blocker Corp (collectively, the “Sponsor Corps”) were contributed by their owners to PetIQ in exchange for 5,615,981 shares of Class A common stock and $30.5 million aggregate principal amount of preference notes payable by us. The contribution resulted in PetIQ acquiring 1,907,858 LLC Interests for the preference notes and 5,615,981 LLC Interests for the shares of Class A common stock. PetIQ also acquired the tax attributes of the Sponsor Corps, which were recorded generally as deferred tax assets at the time of the IPO. Following the contribution, each of the Sponsor Corps became a wholly owned subsidiary of PetIQ.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We exchanged 419,102 shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for 419,102 LLC Interests held by certain employee owners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We purchased 1,589,643 LLC Interests from Continuing LLC Owners in exchange for $25.4 million in preference notes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | We purchased 133,334 LLC Interests from certain Continuing LLC Owners for $2.1 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All preference notes were paid in full upon the closing of the IPO.  Following the completion of the Reorganization Transactions and IPO, PetIQ owned 61.5% of HoldCo. The remaining 38.5% of HoldCo was held by the Continuing LLC Owners, whom the Company defines as all remaining direct and indirect owners of HoldCo except for PetIQ.  As the sole managing member of HoldCo, PetIQ and has the sole voting power in, and controls the management of, HoldCo. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial results of HoldCo and reported a non-controlling interest in its consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about the above-mentioned transactions as well as the other transactions completed in connection with the IPO.  
 Business Overview
 PetIQ is a rapidly growing provider of veterinarian services and veterinarian-grade pet products, including prescription (“Rx”) medications, over-the-counter (“OTC”) flea and tick preventatives and health and wellness products for dogs and cats. We pioneered and are the leading seller to the retail channel of pet products that were previously available for purchase primarily from veterinary clinics. We enable our customers to offer pet owners choice, affordability and convenience in connection with products from leading national brands as well as our proprietary value-branded alternatives. Consumer behavior supports our continuing growth: pet owners are increasingly making purchases  from the channels we serve. In addition, pet owners are shifting their retail purchases from non-veterinarian-grade products, previously the only products available in the retail channel, to the premium veterinarian-grade products that we sell. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these changes in consumer behavior because of our category leadership, broad product portfolio, value proposition and strong customer relationships. The end markets we serve are large and growing.        On January 17, 2018, we acquired Community Veterinary Clinics, LLC d/b/a VIP Petcare (“VIP,” and such acquisition, the “VIP Acquisition”). The aggregate consideration was comprised of $100 million of cash, 4,200,000 LLC Interests, 4,200,000 shares of our Class B common stock, a $10 million note payable due to sellers, and two $10 million earn-outs based on achievement of 2018 and 2019 combined company Adjusted EBITDA targets.  VIP provides a comprehensive suite of services at community clinics and wellness centers hosted at pet retailers across 31 states, which includes diagnostic tests, vaccinations, prescription medications, microchipping and wellness checks. VIP’s veterinary services and products align with PetIQ’s corporate strategy and mission to improve pet health by providing consumers convenient access and affordable choices to a broad portfolio of pet health and wellness solutions. In 2017, VIP saw approximately one million pets through its network of community clinics. Today, PetIQ and VIP serve more than 40 retail partners representing more than 60,000 locations.

 Our product portfolio spans a wide range of veterinarian-grade Rx medications and leading OTC medications as well as other health and wellness products. We offer our customers a comprehensive category management solution and sell products under multiple brands to address channel-specific requirements.         We rapidly develop, manufacture and introduce innovative new products to retailers and consumers. Our current product portfolio and pipeline of future products have been developed through a combination of in-house specialists and animal health research and development experts. In addition, we specialize in market analysis, product development, packaging, marketing, industry licensing and managing both the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulated products. These internal and external resources enable us to expand our portfolio of proprietary value-branded products and develop next-generation versions of our existing products. We believe that our retail expertise and strong market position makes us an attractive partner for scientists and entrepreneurs developing new products in the pet health and wellness field. A combination of our internal expertise and strategic relationships has produced several of our top selling products and brands, including VetIQ, PetAction Plus, Advecta, PetLock Plus and TruProfen.

 Our Industry
 Attractive Pet Industry Trends. In 2016, approximately 63.4 million U.S. households (52% of total U.S. households) owned a dog or a cat, compared to 57.0 million households (50% of total U.S. households) in 2008, according to Packaged Facts. Demographic trends in pet ownership and changing attitudes toward pets support our continuing growth, through the following:
 ∎ Pet Humanization: According to Packaged Facts, in the United States, an estimated 79% of dog owners and 77% of cat owners view their pets as family members. With pets increasingly viewed as companions, friends and family members, pet owners behave like “pet parents” with a strong inclination for spending disposable income to meet all of their pets’ needs during all economic cycles. Pets have become a financial priority.
 ∎ Increasing Consumer Focus on Pet Health and Wellness: Consumers are exhibiting greater interest in improved health for their pets and, as a result, are increasing their spending on veterinary care as well as purchases of the most effective veterinarian-grade pet products and supplies. Pet owners of all demographic and income levels aspire to purchase leading veterinarian-grade treatments.
 ∎ Increasing Pet Age and Incidents of Pet Disease: Pets are living longer and, as a result, have increasing medical needs. In 2016, Packaged Facts reported that 53.9% of dogs and 58.9% of cats are overweight, and in 2015, Packaged Facts reported that approximately 75% of older dogs and predisposed breeds have heart disease.
 ∎ Increasing Market Size and Consumer Spending: Pet spending in the United States has steadily increased every year since 1994, with Americans spending approximately $80 billion on their pets in 2017.  Forecasters expect this trend to contue into the future.
     Strong Growth in Pet Products. According to Packaged Facts and the American Pet Products Association (the “APPA”), Americans spent $81.4 billion on pet products and services in 2016, nearly triple their 2001 spending of $28.5 billion. U.S. sales of pet medications for dogs and cats have grown from $5.8 billion in 2011 to an estimated $7.4 billion in 2016 and are estimated to reach $8.9 billion by 2019, representing a CAGR of 6% between 2016 and 2019, according to Packaged Facts. Additionally, our innovative pet treats compete in the U.S. dog and cat treat market, which has grown every year since 2010. According to Packaged Facts, the U.S. dog and cat treat market has grown to an estimated $6.1 billion in 2016 and is estimated to reach $7.3 billion of retail sales by 2019, representing a CAGR of 6% between 2016 and 2019.
     Growth of Pet Medication Purchases from Retail Channel. We believe the market for pet medication and health and wellness products in the retail channel is likely to outpace growth in the broader pet industry. The pet owner has increasingly purchased veterinarian grade pet products from the retail channel as the estimated mass market share of the U.S. pet medication industry increased from 12% in 2011 to 21% in 2015 while the estimated veterinarian share declined from 63% in 2011 to 59% in 2015. We believe that migration will continue in the future as more consumers take advantage of the convenience of their local retail store, become aware of the significant cost savings that retail channels can deliver, and our product penetration at retail increases. Additionally there is a significant segment of pet owners who have not sought pet health care for a variety of reasons.  Our affordable high-quality products will help unlock demand and provide cost sensitive customers the leading treatments they want at prices they can afford. In addition, we believe our acquisition of VIP makes us uniquely positioned to provide veterinarian services within the retail channel, and continue to benefit from this channel expansion.
 Our Business Strategy
 There are significant opportunities to grow our brand awareness, increase our net sales and profitability and deliver shareholder value by executing on the following initiatives:
 Grow Consumer Awareness of Our Products in the Retail Channel. We are an established category creator in the pet health and wellness and medication market with strong penetration of the retail channel and high awareness among retailers. With our broad retail network that includes the top U.S. retailers, we are increasingly focused on building consumer awareness and converting more pet owners to use our products. As pet owners learn that our proprietary value-

 
  5

 
branded products offer the same active ingredients as leading brands at lower prices, we believe they will shift their purchasing habits to our products and our share of the overall pet Rx and OTC medications and health and wellness products market will continue to grow.
 Increase Volume of Products with Existing Retailers. We conduct business with the majority of leading U.S. retailers with our core product offerings. We believe our net sales will continue to grow as we expand the number of products we have available for sale at each retailer. We also plan to creatively expand SKU placement within existing accounts through our in-house merchandising capabilities. Additionally, following the VIP Acquisition, we believe we are positioned to expand our presence within leading retailers. 
 Provide Veterinarian Services in Conjunction with our Retail Partners. As a result of the VIP Acquisition, we now provide a comprehensive suite of services at community clinics and wellness centers hosted at pet retailers across 31 states, which includes diagnostic tests, vaccinations, prescription medications, microchipping and wellness checks.  We believe we have the ability to expand those offerings within our existing retail footprint, which will provide an additional earnings stream, as well as drive pet parent traffic to our retail partners for the purchase of pet medication and health and wellness products, thereby expanding the sales of our product offerings through our retail partners.      Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 225 employees. Our employees are not represented by any labor union or any collective bargaining arrangement with respect to their employment with us. We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We believe that our employee relations are good.
 We acquired an additional 1,087 full-time and part-time employees and an estimated 980 independent contractors as a result of the consummation of the VIP Acquisition.
 Seasonality
 While many of our products are sold consistently throughout the year, we do experience seasonality in the form of increased demand for our flea and tick product offerings in the first half of the year, both leading up to and throughout the spring and summer seasons. Additionally we may experience fluctuations in net sales related to the inventory management strategies of our retail customers.
 The practice of veterinary medicine is subject to seasonal fluctuation.  In particular, demand for veterinary services is significantly higher during the warmer months as there are more fleas, ticks, and mosquitos during these months and products and services sold to prevent or treat illness or diseases related to these insects.
 Our Products
 We are a manufacturer and distributor of pet medication and health and wellness products to the retail channel. We focus our product offerings on innovative, proprietary value-branded products, and leading third-party branded products for dogs and cats, including pet Rx medications, OTC medications, and wellness products. We offer and supply these products to customers primarily in the United States. Rx Medications
 Our Rx pet medications include heartworm preventatives, arthritis, thyroid, diabetes and pain treatments, antibiotics and other specialty medications, all of which require a prescription from a veterinarian. We co-develop and manufacture our own proprietary value-branded products and distribute well-known leading third-party branded medications. 
 Our proprietary value-branded Rx medications allow consumers to care for their pets with the same quality of branded medications at a much lower cost. Currently, we manufacture Heart Shield Plus, our proprietary value-branded version of Heartgard® Plus, which prevents heartworm infection in dogs. We also manufacture TruProfen, our proprietary value-branded version of Rimadyl®, which treats arthritis in dogs. We plan to develop, and bring to retail customers, proprietary value-branded versions of other popular pet Rx medications currently available only in branded versions at premium prices.

 
  6

 

 We also sell to retailers more than 240 SKUs of the most popular pet Rx medications that previously had been available primarily through the veterinarian channel. These retailers then sell these pet Rx medications to pet owners who have a prescription. We source these pet Rx medications directly from manufacturers or through licensed distributors. Several of the top-selling Rx medications that we distribute include  Rimadyl®; Heartgard® Plus and Vetmedin®.
 OTC Medications and Supplies
 Our OTC medications are primarily comprised of flea and tick control products, which are available in multiple forms, such as spot on (topical) treatments, chewables, and collars. 
 We sell to the retail channel more than 110 SKUs of the most popular leading OTC-branded and value-branded medications consisting primarily of flea and tick control medications. We source OTC medications directly from manufacturers or through licensed distributors.
 Health and Wellness Products
 Our health and wellness products include specialty treats and other pet products such as dental treats and nutritional supplements (including hip and joint, vitamins and skin and coat products). We manufacture and distribute more than 219 SKUs of proprietary wellness products for dogs and cats, mainly under our VetIQ, Betsy Farms and Delightibles product lines. 
 Specific products in this category include dental treats, such as Minties dental treats; nutritional supplements, such as our VetIQ products, skin and coat chews, vitamin chews and treats that disguise medication to aid in pets’ pill ingestion; and treats, such as our Betsy Farms dog treats and Delightibles cat treats.
 Product Innovation
 We offer a broad portfolio of pet medications and health and wellness products to our retail customers, including an array of products that we develop, manufacture and distribute. To continue to grow our pet Rx medication, OTC medications and other health and wellness product offerings, we invest in research and development on an ongoing basis. We use a combination of in-house specialists, third-party consultants and animal health research and development experts to expand our proprietary value-branded portfolio and develop next-generation versions of our current pet products.
 In addition, we have leveraged our market position to emerge as an attractive partner for outside research and development researchers and entrepreneurs developing new products and technologies in the strategic pet health and wellness field. We believe these scientists and entrepreneurs seek out our partnership on innovative products given our experience in proprietary value-branded manufacturing and relationships with key retail channel contacts. Our process of assessing partnerships with any outside research and development opportunity includes performing our own internal research and development review, testing and quality control procedures.
 Channels
 Traditional industry sales channels for pet Rx medications, OTC medications, and other health and wellness products include sales through the veterinarian, retail and e-commerce channels, depending primarily on the product involved.
 Historically, pet Rx and flea and tick medications have been sold through veterinarian offices and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce. We have focused on making these products, as well as our proprietary value-branded products, available directly to consumers through retail outlets, which offer consumers access to these products at lower prices and in more convenient locations. Our retail channel sales are primarily concentrated in five sub-channels of retail: (i) food, drug and mass market sales (e.g., Walmart, Target and Kroger); (ii) club stores (e.g., Sam’s Club, Costco Wholesale and BJ’s Wholesale Club); (iii) pet specialty stores (e.g., PetSmart, Petco and independent pet stores); (iv) e-commerce; and (v) independent pharmacies. E-commerce grew by over 300% in 2017 when compared to 2016.  The Company will continue 

 
  7

 
to grow its e-commerce business in line with total market growth in this channel by supporting its retail partners’ channel strategies and partnering with leading online retailers. 
 We believe we are a key participant in the sales growth of pet medication products to the retail channel. 
 Customers
 As of December 31, 2017, approximately 98% of 2017 and 2016 net sales were generated from customers located in the United States and Canada, with the remaining 2% from foreign locations during each period. Our customers are primarily national superstore chains and national pet superstore chains, such as Walmart, Sam’s Club, Costco, PetSmart, Petco, Kroger, Target, and BJ’s Wholesale Club. We supply each of these customers on a national basis. Our largest retail customers are Walmart and Sam’s Club, which represented 30% and 16%, respectively of our net sales in 2017 and 33% and 21%, respectively, of our net sales in 2016. In addition, Anda Inc. (“Anda”), which distributes our products to pharmacies, accounted for 15% of our net sales in 2017 and 2016. Anda only purchases products that are actively being sold through to retailers. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2017 or 2016.
 At each of our top customers, we sell to several individual departments represented by different buying groups, such as pharmacy, treats, and pet supplies.
 Additionally, we develop strong and lasting relationships with our pharmacy customers by leveraging our product breadth and expertise, superb customer care and support. Pharmacy customers have a higher barrier to entry than other retail customers as they are a highly regulated segment of the retail channel. We believe that, because of such regulation, our pharmacy customers appreciate our focus on integrating our systems with theirs, including interfacing delivery schedules and traceability, which is a key requirement for any major pharmacy retailer. In addition, we try to continually strengthen our pharmacy relationships by providing a variety of value-added services to the pharmacies. These services may include computer programs, training opportunities and web-based customer support.
 Finally, we believe that our level of customer care is critical in retaining and expanding our relationships with our key customers. Our in-house customer care representatives participate in ongoing training programs under the supervision of our training managers. These training sessions include a variety of topics such as product knowledge, computer usage and customer service tips. Our customer care representatives promptly respond to customer inquiries related to products, order status, prices and shipping. We believe that our customer care representatives are a valuable source of feedback regarding customer satisfaction.
 Supply Chain
 Proprietary Value-Branded Products
 None of our suppliers for proprietary value-branded products are individually significant. Our proprietary value-branded products are currently manufactured by us at our facilities in Daytona Beach, Florida and Springville, Utah and through a network of manufacturing facilities owned and operated by contract manufacturing partners across the United States and in Europe. We expect that the combined capacities of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturing partners will meet our forecasted needs for our proprietary value-branded products for the foreseeable future. Distributed Products
 We purchase branded and other products that we distribute, but do not manufacture, from a variety of sources in the United States and Europe, including certain manufacturers and licensed distributors. We believe that having strong relationships with our suppliers will ensure the availability of an adequate volume of products ordered by our retail customers and will enable us to provide more and better product information.

 Fulfillment, Warehousing and Shipping
 To accomplish efficient fulfillment for Rx medication products across the United States, we utilize our established medication distribution channels with our distribution partner, Anda. We have entered into a five-year contract with Anda, which automatically renews for successive two year terms.
 For most products, our in-house fulfillment and distribution operations manage the entire supply chain, beginning with the placement of the order, continuing through order processing and then fulfilling and shipping of the product to the customer. All customer orders are processed by our customer service team. We inventory our products at, and fill most customer orders from, our distribution centers in Daytona Beach, Florida and Springville, Utah. We also use third-party warehouse providers to fulfill a small amount of our orders. We ship our products using common carriers.
 For products sold into local and regional pet specialty retailers, we work with our distribution partner, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies (“Phillips”), one of the largest distributors to independent pet stores in the country. Phillips buys our products directly and resells them to independent pet specialty retailers.
 Product Quality and Safety
 We believe that product safety and quality are critical. We have developed, implemented and enforced a robust product safety and quality program. We have established critical control points throughout the entire supply chain from ingredient sourcing to finished goods to ensure compliance with our quality program.
 The food safety program at our Utah plant, where our pet treats are made, is certified at Safe Quality Food Level II under the Global Food Safety Initiative Benchmarks. To achieve this qualification level, our Utah facility has been built to comply with particular food safety specifications and allows for correct airflow to prevent cross-contamination, among other things. This qualification level also requires us to have certain standard operating procedures in place written to Safe Quality Food code specifications, hold regular training seminars for manufacturing employees and maintain reporting documentation evidencing compliance with such standard operating procedures.
 In addition, our safety and quality program includes strict guidelines for incoming ingredients, batching, processing, packaging and finished goods. As part of our focus on safety and quality, we have implemented batch and lot traceability controls across our manufacturing network, including at our manufacturing facilities, where such controls have been implemented into our enterprise resource planning system. These controls allow us to track and tie discreet, inbound raw material components through the manufacturing process to the ultimate finished product, allowing us to maintain and control all finished product lot details and quickly access process manufacturing details.
 At the Florida facility where our Rx and OTC medications are held for distribution, we maintain a Veterinary Prescription Drug Wholesale Distributor license with the State of Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which is the same government entity that regulates distribution facilities for human medications. In connection with our maintenance of this license, the State of Florida conducts random inspections of our facility. To pass these inspections, we must demonstrate safety compliance at the highest standard, including maintaining correct plant temperatures and environmental controls.
 As described above, we use contract manufacturers to produce certain of our proprietary value-branded products. To ensure product quality, consistency and safety standards, we actively monitor each contract manufacturer’s operations through the standard operating procedures and facility audits described above.
 All of our contract manufacturing facilities are required to have quality control standard operating procedures in place. We require our contract manufacturing facilities to maintain third-party certifications and pass our own quality system and safety audits, and for FDA-regulated products, to comply with the Good Manufacturing Practices of the FDA. Third-party certifications provide an independent and external assessment that a product and/or process complies with applicable safety regulations and standards, though a regulatory authority may disagree with that assessment. In addition, our quality control 

 
  9

 
team conducts reviews of all aspects of our supply chain to ensure that ingredients, finished goods and manufacturing processes meet our strict safety and quality requirements and that all of our ingredients are rigorously tested prior to being used in our products.
 Any consumer may call our customer service line, where we have trained representatives on staff. Any call reporting an adverse event relating to our products is further addressed by our third-party vendor, SafetyCall, through its own on-site veterinarians. On a quarterly basis, we submit filings in accordance with the EPA specifications reporting any adverse event associated with our flea and tick products.
 Marketing and Advertising
 Our marketing strategy largely focuses on building awareness and educating pet owners about our various brands and products. To accomplish this goal, we use a combination of television, digital marketing (e.g. digital coupons, display ads, pay per click, email), social media marketing and in-store displays and promotions. Our marketing message highlights the quality and cost-savings our products offer customers such as our proprietary, value-branded flea and tick products that contain the same active ingredients as leading brands at affordable prices.  Competition
 The pet medication and health and wellness industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of product quality, product availability, quality, palatability, brand awareness, loyalty and trust, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and design, shelf space, reputation, price point and promotional efforts. We compete directly and indirectly with both manufacturers and distributors of pet medication and health and wellness products and online distributors, as well as with veterinarians. We directly face competition from companies that distribute various pet medications and pet health and wellness products to traditional retailers such as Perrigo, Unicharm Company and Central Garden and Pet Company, all of which are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. We also face competition in our other pet health and wellness products category from companies such as Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlè”), Mars, Inc (“Mars”), Perrigo Company plc (“Perrigo”), and The J.M. Smucker Company (“Smucker”), all of which are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
 Our retail customers compete with online retailers and veterinarians for the sale of Rx and OTC pet medications and other health and wellness products. Many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications or other health products during a veterinarian visit. In order to effectively compete with veterinarians, we and retail partners must continue to educate pet owners about the product availability, service and savings offered by purchasing pet medications and other health products in their retail stores.
 With our acquisition of VIP, we will now compete directly with veterinarians. Our primary competitors for our veterinary clinics in most markets are individual practitioners or small, regional multi-clinic practices. In addition, some national companies such as Banfield Pet Hospitals, VCA Animal Hospitals, or Petco are developing or have developed networks of veterinary clinics in markets in which VIP currently operates.
 Our Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “PetIQ,” “PetAction,” “Advecta,” “PetLock,” “Heart Shield Plus,” “TruProfen,” “Betsy Farms,” “Minties,” “Vera,” “Delightibles” and “VetIQ,” all of which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also have numerous other trademark registrations and pending applications, in the U.S., Canada and Europe, for product names that are central to our branding. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce our brand, our sub-brands and our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with the goods or services identified in the applicable 

 
  10

 
registrations. In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous URL designations, including www.vetiq.com, www.advecta.com, www.delightibles.com and www.mintiestreats.com, that are important to the successful implementation of our marketing and advertising strategy. We also have patents and pending patent applications for products, formulas and packaging that we consider important to our business. We rely on and carefully protect unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 Government Regulation
 Along with our contract manufacturers, ingredient and packaging suppliers and third-party shipping providers, we are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, intended to protect public health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Our operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EPA, the Florida Department of Health and the USDA and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including drug and food safety standards.
 All Rx animal drugs are required to be approved by the FDA through either a New Animal Drug Application or, in the case of generic Rx animal drugs, an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (“ANADA”). Two of our proprietary value-branded products, TruProfen and Heart Shield Plus, have been approved by the FDA under ANADAs submitted to the FDA by third parties. We have agreements with these third parties that hold approved ANADAs to private label or proprietary value-branded products under such ANADAs, However, the third parties that hold the ANADAs are ultimately responsible for compliance with regulatory obligations associated with these products.
 In addition, our foreign subsidiaries are subject to the laws of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union, as well as provincial and local regulations.
 Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies and authorities, among other things, (i) prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety, (ii) regulate our marketing, advertising and sales to consumers and (iii) control the importing and exporting of our products. Certain of these agencies, in certain circumstances, must not only approve our products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States and elsewhere. In particular, certain of our pet medication products require FDA approval prior to marketing. To market such an FDA-regulated pet medicine, the FDA must approve a new animal drug application, or NADA, supported by data from animal safety and effectiveness studies that adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of that product in the target animal for the intended indication; or, in the case of generic versions of previously approved reference-listed pet medicines, the FDA an ANADA, supported by data to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic product has the same active ingredients in the same concentration as the reference-listed product and is bioequivalent to the reference listed product. After approval, manufacturers are required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to the FDA. Some of the products we distribute are marketed pursuant to approved ANADAs held by third parties with whom we contract to distribute those ANADA-approved products under our own label.
 We are subject to labor and employment laws, safety and health regulations and other laws, including those promulgated by the EPA and the National Labor Relations Board. Our operations, and those of our contract manufacturers, ingredient and packaging suppliers and third-party shipping providers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety matters as well as environmental and natural resource protection, including the availability and use of pesticides, emissions and discharges to the environment, and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and wastes. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. No assurance can be given, however, that material costs and liabilities will not arise in the future, such as due to a change in the law or the discovery of currently unknown conditions.
 Certain states have laws, rules and regulations which require that veterinary medical practices be either wholly-owned or majority-owned by licensed veterinarians and that corporations which are not wholly-owned or majority-owned by licensed veterinarians refrain from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, veterinary medical care. In these states and provinces, we provide management and other administrative services to veterinary practices rather than 

 
  11

 
owning such practices or providing such care. In some cases, in addition to providing management and administrative services we may lease the veterinary facility and equipment to the veterinary practice. Although we have structured our operations to comply with our understanding of the veterinary medicine laws of each state and province in which we operate, interpretive legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed.
     In addition, all of the states in which we operate impose various registration permit and/or licensing requirements. To fulfill these requirements, we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and, where required, have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility. All veterinarians practicing in our animal wellness centers are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice.
