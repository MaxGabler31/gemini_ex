Our Business Objectives and Strategies
 
Our business objectives include providing sports media content to national broadcasters, internet streaming services and other content distributors and leveraging those arrangements to attract major brand sponsorships. We also plan to enhance the scope of our fighter management and ticketing platforms. To achieve these objectives, we intend to employ the following strategies:
Securing Premier Venues
 
We intend to continue migrating our promotional events from paid venue arrangements to venues that will compensate the promotions for hosting events, such as community sponsored civic auditoriums and casinos. We expect that the relocation of our events to higher quality venues will enable us more easily to obtain content distribution arrangements with national broadcasters and others.
Distribution and Licensing our Original Content
 
We produce high quality MMA programming at the events we promote, and monetize our content through distribution and licensing arrangements. A number of our promotions have established live and delayed television arrangements with national networks, including CBS Sports Network and Comcast Sports Net.
Obtaining National Sponsorships
 
In addition to local and regional sponsors for live events, we anticipate identifying, negotiating and establishing sponsorship and advertising arrangements with larger nationally-recognized brands. SuckerPunch actively pursues local, regional and national sponsorships for fighters under management, under which management commissions are earned.
 
Enhancing the CageTix Ticketing Platform
 
Currently, the majority of paid tickets for our events is sold by the fighters appearing on the event fight card. Referred to as “fighter consigned” tickets, sales are generally made in face-to-face cash transactions. We continue to expand the utilization of CageTix to help control the ticketing sales chain across our promotions. We believe that greater use of CageTix by our promotions will allow us to increase the profitability of our live events, while capturing valuable demographic customer information that will facilitate subsequent sales and marketing efforts. The CageTix platform can provide significant benefits to the promotions, including the security of credit/debit card sales processing; immediate revenue recognition; real time sales reporting; and sales audit and compliance tracking for tax and regulatory authorities.
 
Identifying and Signing Top Prospects
 
We intend to continue signing highly-regarded professional fighters, which we believe enhances our brand recognition and the value of our live MMA programming content. We believe that by providing fighters with a large number of events in which to participate, and by televising or streaming these events, we will be able to provide prospects with multi-fight opportunities and the visibility they seek when affiliating with a promotion.

Competition
 
The market for live and televised MMA events and for MMA video content is extremely competitive. The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
 

· | The ability to attract and retain successful professional fighters in order to promote events that are appealing to fans and sponsors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ability to produce high-quality media content on a consistent basis to secure television and other media distribution arrangements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ability to command the attention of the UFC and other premier MMA promotions seeking professional fighters to promote on a national and/or international platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ability to generate brand awareness in the relevant geographic market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Despite the competition we face, we believe that our approach of combining multiple regional MMA promotions under one umbrella organization enables us to leverage their collective resources and relationships to address competition more effectively than a single regional promotion on its own. In addition, our multi-regional presence enables us to offer sponsors and media outlets a broad geographic footprint in which to market products, services and content.


Government Regulation
 
Our MMA events are regulated at the state level by the athletic commission in each state where our promotions are conducted. The commissions are concerned primarily with the introduction and enforcement of safety rules and oversee MMA in much the same way as they do boxing.

Intellectual Property
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and work for hire agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use.
 
 We maintain a catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights to television programming and photographs. We also own a number of domain names including, alliancemma.com, the domain names of each of our promotions, CageTix.com and Suckerpunchent.com.
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.
 
Seasonality
 
We have historically experienced a negative seasonal impact on revenues during the months of June, July and August when attendance is lower at scheduled events than during the balance of the year. As a result, we generally schedule fewer events during this period, which is likely to result in less revenue during these periods compared to other periods during the year.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 34 employees.
 
Facilities
 
The Company does not own any real property. The principal executive offices are located at an office complex in New York, New York, consisting of shared office space that we are leasing. The lease had an original one-year term that commenced on December 1, 2015, which was renewed until November 30, 2018. The lease allows for the limited use of private offices, conference rooms, mail handling, videoconferencing, and certain other business services.
 
In November 2016, the Company entered a sublease agreement for office and video production space in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The lease expires on June 30, 2019.
 
With the acquisition of Fight Club OC, the Company assumed a lease for office space in Orange County, California. The lease expires in September 2018.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
In conducting our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.
 
In April and May 2017, respectively, two purported securities class action complaints—Shapiro v. Alliance MMA, Inc., No. 1:17-cv-2583 (D.N.J.), and Shulman v. Alliance MMA, Inc., No. 1:17-cv-3282 (S.D.N.Y.)—were filed against the Company and certain of its officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, respectively. The complaints alleged that the defendants violated certain provisions of the federal securities laws, and purported to seek damages in an amount to be alleged on behalf of a class of shareholders who purchased the Company’s common stock pursuant or traceable to the Company’s initial public offering. In July 2017, the plaintiffs in the New York action voluntarily dismissed their claim and, on March 8, 2018, the parties reached a settlement to the New Jersey action in which the carrier for our directors and officers liability insurance policy has agreed to cover Alliance’s financial obligations, including legal fees, under the settlement arrangement, less a deductible of $250,000.
 
In October 2017, a shareholder derivative claim based on the same facts that were alleged in the class action complaints was filed against the directors of the Company in the District Court for the District New Jersey; however, a complaint was not served on the defendants and, on February 2, 2018, the claim was dismissed by the District Court.
