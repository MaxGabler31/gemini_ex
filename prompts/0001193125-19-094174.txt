 BUSINESS OF PYRAMAX BANK, FSB 
 General 
 PyraMax Bank, FSB is a federally chartered mutual savings bank headquartered in Greenfield, Wisconsin. PyraMax Bank, FSB was established in 1895 as South Milwaukee Savings and Loan Association and has operated continuously in the Milwaukee metropolitan area since that time. In 1993, the bank changed its name to South Milwaukee Savings Bank, S.A. In May 2000, a merger between South Milwaukee Savings Bank and Mitchell Savings Bank officially formed PyraMax Bank, SSB. The bank changed to a federal savings bank charter in 2003, changing its name to PyraMax Bank, FSB. 
 From our founding in 1895, we operated as a traditional thrift institution, offering primarily residential mortgage loans and savings accounts, supplemented with multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In 2007, Richard Hurd was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer of PyraMax Bank, FSB. Mr. Hurd began shifting PyraMax Bank, FSBs focus to include more business-oriented products and services. In 2010, PyraMax Bank, FSB hired Charles Mauer as its Chief Credit Officer, continuing our increased focus on business-oriented lending. 
 Commercial real estate growth has been the primary source of recent loan growth, and commercial business loan originations have also been emphasized. 
 We conduct our operations from our five full-service banking offices in Milwaukee County, our two full-service banking offices in Waukesha County and our full-service banking office in Ozaukee County Wisconsin. We sold our branch located at 1605 West Mitchell Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in January 2019. We consider our primary lending market area to be Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee Counties, however, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market. 
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans (which includes non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied commercial real estate and one- to four-family non-owner occupied loans), commercial loans (which includes commercial and industrial loans) and consumer loans. 
 Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase our focus on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans in an effort to continue to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises, state and municipal securities, asset-backed securities and corporate collateralized mortgage-backed securities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. Additionally, we have used borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, to fund our operations. 
 Reflecting our focus on our community, in connection with the offering, we established a charitable foundation called 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin Community Foundation and funded it with $100,000 in cash and 48,767 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate contribution of $587,670 (based on the $10.00 per share offering price). The purpose of this foundation will be to make contributions to support various charitable organizations operating in our community now and in the future. 
 Our website address is www.pyramaxbank.com. Information on this website should not be considered a part of this report. 
 Market Area 
 We conduct our operations from our five full-service banking offices in Milwaukee County, our two full-service banking offices in Waukesha County and our full-service banking office in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. We consider our primary lending market area to be southeastern Wisconsin, however, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market.

 Milwaukee County contains a diverse cross section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, federal and local government, health care facilities and finance-related employment. Milwaukee County had an estimated population of 952,085 in 2017. 
 Milwaukee County is primarily an urban community and is the fortieth wealthiest county in Wisconsin. Our banking office in downtown Milwaukee is located in the historic Third Ward district, a mixed-use neighborhood that includes over 450 businesses. Our other Milwaukee County banking offices are located in more suburban areas, but are still in proximity to downtown Milwaukee. PyraMax Bank, FSB works with the City of Milwaukee and neighborhood housing agencies to support home ownership in all markets in which we operate. 
 Waukesha County is primarily a suburban community and is the second wealthiest county in Wisconsin, with a median household income of $78,268 from 2011 to 2017. Waukesha County had an estimated population of 400,621 in 2017. Waukesha County has a diversified economy, including numerous educational institutions and a wide-ranging hospitality industry. 
 Ozaukee County is the wealthiest county in Wisconsin, with a median household income of $78,415 from 2011 to 2017. Ozaukee County had an estimated population of 88,429 in 2017. Ozaukee Countys economy includes manufacturing, agricultural, healthcare, governmental and trade sectors. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
 As of June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share was 0.68% of total deposits in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, making us the 29th largest out of 47 banks in Milwaukee County. 
 Lending Activities 
 Our principal lending activity is in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial and commercial real estate loans, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We compete by focusing on personalized service for consumers as well as businesses. Due to our structure, we are able to move quickly on client requests and are able to price competitively compared to our competitors. Our responsiveness has enabled us to grow and retain our customer base. Additionally, the Milwaukee market has demonstrated strong growth and diversity in the commercial segment. Our focus on Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties enables us to utilize a limited sales force for maximum results. Our reputation for strong credit underwriting has also allowed us to build a network of smaller banks that purchase participations of loans which exceed our legal lending limit.

Total | $ | 251,325 | | $ | 94,343 | | $ | 345,668

 One- to four-family Residential Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2018, we had $108.1 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 29.0% of our total loan portfolio. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, 73.1% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 26.9% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. 
 Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Fannie Mae, which as of December 31, 2018 was generally $453,100 for single-family homes in our market area. The maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Fannie Mae will increase to $484,350 for the year ended December 31, 2019. We sell, on both a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis, our conforming and eligible jumbo fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming 
 
7 


  loans, which are referred to as jumbo loans that we may retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%. At December 31, 2018, we had $7.8 million in jumbo loans, which represented 7.1% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was approximately $600,000 at December 31, 2018. Generally, all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in southeastern Wisconsin. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made in excess of this limit. 
 Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years, although we also offer initial terms of three or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the applicable treasury rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan and a rate floor. We typically hold in our loan portfolio our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments. 
 Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to five years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. 
 We do not offer interest only mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not have a subprime lending program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories). 
 Generally, residential mortgage loans that we originate include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of PyraMax Bank, FSB. We also require homeowners insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. 
 Residential Real Estate Construction Lending. We originate loans to finance the construction of owner occupied one- to four-family residential properties to the prospective homeowners. At December 31, 2018, residential construction loan balances were $2.1 million, or 0.6% of our total loan portfolio, with an additional $3.4 million available to borrowers. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 Our owner occupied one- to four-family residential construction loans are generally structured as interest-only for 12 months. Construction loan values for one-to four-family residential properties generally will not exceed 80% during the construction phase of the mortgage, however, if private mortgage insurance is obtained we will consider loan-to-value limits up to 95%. 
 Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, generally within 12 months, the loan will convert to an amortizing loan for the remaining term of the loan. Upon completion the loan will be evaluated for sale on the secondary market. The interest rate is generally a fixed rate for up to 30 years, or a five- to seven-year adjustable rate mortgage. 
 
8 


 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Commercial Real Estate Lending. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $193.8 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 52.0% of our total loan portfolio. Of this aggregate amount, we had $72.5 million in non-owner occupied non-residential real estate, $61.8 million in multi-family residential real estate, $36.7 million in owner occupied non-residential real estate, $10.4 million in non-owner occupied residential real estate loans, $10.2 million in commercial real estate construction loans, and $2.2 million in commercial land development loans. 
 Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail facilities and restaurants and other special purpose commercial properties, primarily in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee Counties, Wisconsin. Our multi-family loans, which are classified as commercial real estate loans in the tabular presentation, are generally secured by properties consisting of five or more rental units in our market area. We also purchase and participate in commercial real estate loans from other financial institutions. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies. 
 Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five to ten years and amortization terms of 15 to 30 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term, and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the prime rate or the applicable treasury rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan. 
 We originate a variety of adjustable-rate multi-family residential real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 30 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every five, seven or ten years and generally are indexed to the prime rate or the corresponding Treasury rate, plus a margin. We generally include pre-payment penalties on multi-family residential real estate loans we originate. 
 At December 31, 2018, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was approximately $655,000, and the largest of such loans was a $6.1 million loan consisting of an outstanding balance of $5.6 million, with approximately $500,000 available, for a commercial construction project secured by a first mortgage on an industrial property. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2018. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrowers payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.20x. All commercial real estate loans, with the exception of owner occupied real estate, of $500,000 or more are appraised by outside independent appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. We require property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 
 In underwriting multi-family and non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loans debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property

  securing the loan, whichever is lower. When circumstances warrant, guarantees are obtained from multi-family and one-to four-family residential real estate customers. In addition, the borrowers and guarantors financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. 
 Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 We also originate loans to finance the construction of commercial properties, multi-family residential projects (including non-owner occupied one- to four-family residences) and professional complexes. At December 31, 2018, commercial construction loan balances were $10.2 million, or 2.8% of our total loan portfolio. Under these loans, an additional $2.0 million remains available to borrowers. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 Our commercial real estate construction loans are generally structured as interest-only payments during the anticipated construction time. The interest rate is generally fixed for five years at the five-year Treasury rate plus a margin of 1.9% to 2.4%. We generally offer commercial construction loans with a value up to 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. 
 Construction loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development or improvements, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale or rental of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Land Development Loans. We originate loans to finance the development of land for agricultural purposes and for the development of commercial and residential properties. Land development loans are generally secured by vacant land and/or property that is in the process of improvement. At December 31, 2018, land development loans were $2.2 million, or 0.6% of our total loan portfolio, with no additional funds available to borrowers. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 Our land development loans may be structured as interest-only loans or amortizing. The interest rate generally floats, at the prime rate or prime rate plus 1%. We offer financing to purchase or refinance land for agricultural purposes or development with a maximum loan to value ratio of 65%. However, if we are providing financing to improve the land, the maximum loan to value ratio will generally be 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less.

 Before making a commitment to fund a land development loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We will monitor the land loan in a similar fashion to any other commercial real estate loan. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest land development loan had an outstanding balance of $1.7 million and was secured by agricultural land. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 Commercial Lending. At December 31, 2018, we had $30.5 million of commercial loans, representing 8.2% of our total loan portfolio. We originate commercial loans and lines of credit secured by non-real estate business assets. These loans are made based primarily on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not behave as forecasted, and collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value because of economic or individual performance factors. Financial information is obtained from the borrowers to evaluate cash flow sufficiency to service debt and is periodically updated during the life of the loan. These loans are generally originated to small businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial loans are generally used by the borrowers for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. Our commercial loans are generally term loans with terms of three to seven years and lines of credit with terms of one to two years, with a target loan size of $250,000 to $5.0 million. Our commercial and industrial lines of credit are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis tied to the prime rate. Term loans are generally priced at a spread over the applicable treasury rate. We generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial loans. 
 At December 31, 2018, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial loans was approximately $94,000, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan commitment was a $5.75 million loan to a financial/leasing company, which provides equipment financing, through leases and loans, to their customers in the technology, office, medical, manufacturing, construction and communication industries, among others. When the financial/leasing company enters into a loan or lease with their customer, they obtain the necessary funding from the Bank to fulfill their lease or loan commitment to their customer. The term of our advances are generally the same as the term the financial/leasing company provider to their customer. The Banks funding is secured by an assignment of the relevant lease or loan documents between the financial/leasing company and its customer. This commitment was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2018. 
 We typically originate commercial loans on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business, the experience and stability of the borrowers management team, earnings projections and their underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. In addition, commercial loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.

 Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including home equity lines of credit, new and used automobile loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2018, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $38.1 million, or 10.2% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, $36.2 million of that amount, or 9.7% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit, which lines of credit had $31.1 million available to draw. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $17,000 of unsecured consumer loans. 
 Generally, our home equity lines of credit are underwritten with a maximum loan to value of 85%, a minimum credit score of 640 and a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%. 
 Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
 Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans 
 Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. 
 We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such residential loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, on both a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis, with limited or no recourse, while retaining some non-eligible fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold $56.0 million and $63.0 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 The loans that we originate to sell are closed in our name, and are subsequently sold to our investors who provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conventional products as well as FHA and VA government loans. We recognize, at the time of sale, the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale income. 
 From time to time, we may purchase commercial real estate and commercial loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2018, we had seven loans totaling $7.8 million in which we were not the lead lender, all of which were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. We also have participated out portions of a loan that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. Historically, we have not purchased whole loans, however, pursuant to our growth strategy, we may purchase whole loans in the future. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that PyraMax Bank, FSB is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of PyraMax Bank, FSBs unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by readily marketable collateral or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2018, based on the 15% limitation, PyraMax Bank, FSBs loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $5.7 million. On the same date, PyraMax Bank, FSB had one borrower with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. At the time the loan was originated the borrower was within PyraMax Bank, FSBs legal lending limit, and only exceeded this limit based on a subsequent decrease in PyraMax Bank, FSBs capital levels. At December 31, 2018, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for $6.1 million, consisting of an outstanding balance of $5.6 million, with approximately $500,000 available, for a commercial construction loan project secured by a first 
 
12 


  mortgage on an industrial property. The loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms on that date. Our loans-to-one borrower regulatory limitation increased to approximately $7.5 million following the completion of our stock offering in January 2019 due to the additional capital PyraMax Bank, FSB received, however, the Board of Directors has set an internal loan to one borrower limit of $6.0 million. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed information submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan information is primarily designed to determine the borrowers ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. 
 All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to $2.0 million. Our Chief Credit Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to $1.0 million. Our Vice President-Credit Administration has individual authorization to approve loans up to $250,000. Our Officers Loan Committee, which consists of our President, Chief Brand Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Vice President-Credit Administration and all commercial lenders, can approve loans up to $2.0 million in the aggregate. Loans in excess of $2.0 million require the approval of our Board of Directors, or, if exigent circumstances exist, the President and Chief Credit Officer may approve such loans if the Board of Directors is unavailable and such approval is based on a recommendation of the Chief Credit Officer and is subsequently approved by the Board of Directors. 
 In addition, the following individuals have retail consumer loan authority: our Chief Brand Officer can approve loans up to $200,000; our Vice President-Retail Operations and Senior Underwriters can approve loans up to $150,000; our Junior Underwriters can approve loans up to $100,000; our Vice President-Retail Banking, Sales Manager can approve loans up to $100,000; and one Branch Executive Officer can approve loans up to $75,000 while all other Branch Executive Officers can approve loans up to $1,000. 
 Our Chief Brand Officer, Vice President-Retail Loan Operations, and Senior Underwriters and Underwriters have authority to approve conforming mortgage loans up to the secondary market limit. 
 Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. 
 From time to time, a loan applicant may not meet one or more of the loan policy or loan program requirements, resulting in a denial of the loan application. The loan officer may seek an exception, by providing detailed information to explain the policy/program exception along with other pertinent information. The following individuals have the authority to approve these requests with the indicated loan limits for commercial mortgage loans and consumer loans: the Board of Directors may approve loans with exceptions up to the legal lending limit of PyraMax Bank, FSB; the Officers Loan Committee and our President and Chief Executive Officers may approve loans with exceptions up to $2.0 million; and our Chief Credit Officer may approve loans with exceptions up to $1.0 million. Our Chief Brand Officer has the authority to approve exceptions on conforming mortgage loans up to the secondary market limits, however, the loan would still need to qualify for sale in the secondary market after granting the exception. Our Chief Brand Officer and Resolution Officer have exception authority for consumer loans with limits of $200,000 and $100,000, respectively. 
 Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets 
 Delinquency Procedures for Owner Occupied One- to Four-Family Residential and Consumer Loans. When an owner-occupied residential real estate or consumer loan payment becomes 16 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice, and loan officers and/or members of our loan collection department may contact the customer. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail an additional late notice, and we also place telephone calls to the borrower. These loan collection efforts continue until a loan becomes 90-120 days past due, at which point we would generally refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings unless management determines that it is in the best interest of PyraMax Bank, FSB to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. The foreclosure process generally would begin when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent. From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure. 
 
13 


 Delinquency Procedures for Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans. When a commercial loan or commercial real estate loan becomes 10 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice. The loan officer assigned to the account may also contact the borrower. If the loan continues to run past due, the loan officer will continue to contact the borrower to determine the cause of the past due payment(s) and arrange for payments. This information will be discussed with the Chief Credit Officer to determine the nature of the past due payment and, if necessary, to develop a plan to bring the past due payment(s) current and determine if the likelihood of repayment is in question. The loan will also be evaluated for a change to the risk rating. Depending on the circumstances, the lender and Chief Credit Officer may develop a plan to protect PyraMax Bank, FSBs interest in the loan. If necessary, PyraMax Bank, FSB will engage an attorney to pursue further collection efforts. 
 Our High Risk Loan Committee, which consists of our President, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Lending Officer provides oversight of stressed commercial and retail loans to mitigate identified risks. 
 Loans Past Due and Nonperforming Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or nonperforming when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.
   When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal, or evaluation when acceptable, to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

 Nonperforming Loans. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Nonperforming loans decreased to $1.6 million, or 0.42% of total loans, at December 31, 2018 from $1.9 million, or 0.57% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 and $3.0 million, or 0.95% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming loans was due to decreases in nonperforming loans in all loan categories. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and PyraMax Bank, FSB grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. Troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired loans. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at December 31, 2018. 
 Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $649,000 in non-accrual troubled debt restructurings, none of which were in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2018. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $459,000 in accruing troubled debt restructurings.

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Interest income that would have been recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 had non-accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to approximately $108,000. In addition, there was an immaterial amount of interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 had accruing troubled debt restructurings been current according to their original terms. 
 Foreclosed Assets. Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, no loans were transferred into foreclosed assets. We had no foreclosed assets at December 31, 2017. 
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the OCC to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. 
 
17 


 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses in the loan portfolio. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institutions determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the watch/special mention list where management has some concern that the collateral or debt service ability may not be adequate, although the collectability of the contractual loan payments is still probable. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to substandard, doubtful or loss depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. For commercial loans, substandard ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability such that collectability of the contractual loan payments is no longer probable. For commercial loans, doubtful ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability, and collectability of the contractual loan payments is unlikely. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified substandard. Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis. 
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified assets at the dates indicated were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in managements judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on managements evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, managements ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 
18 


 As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

 At December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.88% of total loans and 209.77% of non-performing loans, and at December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.93% of total loans and 163.9% of non-performing loans. There were $(169,000), $(85,000) and $79,000 in net loan charge-offs (recoveries) during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Investment Activities 
 General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. All of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale.
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. 
 The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our investment securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago common stock) at the dates indicated. At the dates indicated, all of our investment securities were held as available-for-sale.

 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2018. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a combined federal and state marginal tax rate of 27.2%. Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investment securities available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity.

 Obligations of State and Political Subdivision (Municipal) Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had municipal securities totaling $11.2 million, which constituted 17.0% of our securities portfolio. Our current municipal securities have a weighted average maturity of 4.06 years. These securities often provide slightly higher after-tax yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid as other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio. 
 Government-sponsored Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities totaling $50.4 million, which constituted 76.6% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as pass-through certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is passed through to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. All of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency, the Small Business Administration, or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Corporate Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. At December 31, 2018, we had corporate collateralized mortgage obligations totaling approximately $410,000, which constituted 0.6% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection. 
 Asset-backed Securities. At December 31, 2018 we had asset-backed securities comprised of pools of student loans totaling $3.5 million, which constituted 5.4% of our securities portfolio. All of our asset-backed securities are investment grade and have interest rates tied to an index (LIBOR). 
 Certificates of Deposit. At December 31, 2018, we had certificates of deposit totaling approximately $246,000, which constituted 0.4% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. We held common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $1.3 million at December 31, 2018. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago common stock is carried at cost. We may be required to purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock if we increase borrowings in the future. 
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for certain of our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us non-interest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2018, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $13.4 million and was issued by two insurance companies, each of which was rated AA+ by Standard & Poors. 
Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances, to supplement cash flow needs, 
 
23 


  lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings, health savings and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. At December 31, 2018, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $223.9 million, representing 55.1% of total deposits. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue our effort to increase our core deposits. 
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. 
 Our strategy is to not be the market leader in overall pricing for deposits. We find it more profitable to concentrate on specific special rate and term accounts, which allows us to add accounts without impacting our overall liability costs for existing accounts. We concentrate on odd-month, longer term certificates and larger minimum balance non-maturity deposits to generate new funds. Additionally, in 2018, we established a Treasury Management department, which concentrates on gathering deposits from both existing commercial loan clients and new commercial prospects. We anticipate that Treasury Management activities will have a positive impact on lower cost deposits and will aid in retaining full service clients.

 Borrowed Funds. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. We use such advances to provide funding as a supplement to our deposits. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2018, we had $30.0 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2018, due to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicagos repurchase of its stock, we had $800,000 in additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances available, although we may access additional advances if we purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago capital stock. 
 Additionally, at December 31, 2018 we had a $10.0 million federal funds rate line of credit with the BMO Harris Bank, none of which was drawn at December 31, 2018, as well as a line of credit at the Federal Reserve.

 TAXATION 
 PyraMax Bank, FSB, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC (as of on January 8, 2019) and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. (as of on January 8, 2019) are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and PyraMax Bank, FSB. 
 Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 Federal Taxation 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, PyraMax Bank, FSB currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and PyraMax Bank, FSB will file a consolidated federal income tax return beginning in 2019. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, PyraMax Bank, FSB has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. It currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code). 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry net operating losses forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB had a federal net operating loss carryover of $12.5 million that will begin to expire in 2029. 
 Capital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB had no capital loss carryovers. 
 Corporate Dividends. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from PyraMax Bank, FSB as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
State Taxation 
 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. are subject to the Wisconsin corporate franchise (income) tax. Wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of 7.9% on the combined taxable incomes of the members of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc.s consolidated income tax group, which will include PyraMax Bank, FSB. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Wisconsin law allows financial institutions to carry forward a Wisconsin net operating loss to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB had Wisconsin net operating loss carryover of $22.6 million that will begin to expire in 2021.

 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 General 
 As a federal savings bank, PyraMax Bank, FSB is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and, secondarily, by the FDIC as deposits insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which PyraMax Bank, FSB may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. That includes with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 PyraMax Bank, FSB is also regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, PyraMax Bank, FSB is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. PyraMax Bank, FSBs relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of PyraMax Bank, FSBs loan documents. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to PyraMax Bank, FSB and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on PyraMax Bank, FSB and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc., PyraMax Bank, FSB and their operations. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, PyraMax Bank, FSB may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts. PyraMax Bank, FSB may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for PyraMax Bank, FSB, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 Examinations and Assessments. PyraMax Bank, FSB is primarily supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. PyraMax Bank, FSB is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. PyraMax Bank, FSB is required to pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund the agencys operations. 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital 
 
29 


  to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% of Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised a one-time opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). PyraMax Bank, FSB did exercise the opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institutions assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators. 
 At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSBs capital exceeded all applicable requirements including the applicable capital conservation buffer. See Historical and Pro Forma Regulatory Capital Compliance. 
 
30 


 Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institutions level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% is considered to be undercapitalized. A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be significantly undercapitalized. A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be critically undercapitalized. 
 Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes critically undercapitalized within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings associations assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB met the criteria for being considered well capitalized, which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%. 
 
31 


 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, PyraMax Bank, FSB must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or QTL, test. Under the QTL test, PyraMax Bank, FSB must maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. Portfolio assets generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings associations business. 
 Alternatively, PyraMax Bank, FSB may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 
 A savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB satisfied the QTL test. 
 Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings associations capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if: 

 | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings associations net income for that year to date plus the savings associations retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as PyraMax Bank, FSB, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend. 
 An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
 

 | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings associations record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings associations failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at 
 
32 


  a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. PyraMax Bank, FSB received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal evaluation. 
 Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings associations authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as PyraMax Bank, FSB. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. is an affiliate of PyraMax Bank, FSB because of its control of PyraMax Bank, FSB. In general, certain transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets from an affiliate and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
PyraMax Bank, FSBs authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 

 | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of PyraMax Bank, FSBs capital.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by PyraMax Bank, FSBs board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 
33 


 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as PyraMax Bank, FSB. Deposit accounts in PyraMax Bank, FSB are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institutions rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institutions total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. 
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (FICO) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0.32 basis points of assets less tangible equity. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by 2019. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of PyraMax Bank, FSB. PyraMax Bank, FSB cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. PyraMax Bank, FSB is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, PyraMax Bank, FSB is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2018, PyraMax Bank, FSB was in compliance with this requirement. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by PyraMax Bank, FSB are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. PyraMax Bank, FSBs operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

 | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
34 


 
 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Truth in Savings Act, governing disclosures with respect to deposit accounts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The operations of PyraMax Bank, FSB also are subject to the: 
 

 | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings associations to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institutions privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holding Company Regulation 
 General. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC are savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act. As such, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc., 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 
 
35 


 Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, and for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC have not elected financial holding company status. 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings association or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
 The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 
 

 | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of the Small Bank Holding Company exception to its consolidated capital requirements and increased the threshold for the exception from $500 million of consolidated assets to $1.0 billion, effective May 15, 2015. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. Recent legislation directed the Federal Reserve Board to expand the applicability of the exception to holding companies of up to $3.0 billion of consolidated assets. 
 Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. 
 Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends

  should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the companys net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the companys overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the companys capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Waivers of Dividends by 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, unless 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding companys members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a non-grandfathered mutual holding company such as 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, each officer or director of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. and PyraMax Bank, FSB, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form. 
 Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect control of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the companys outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the companys outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
