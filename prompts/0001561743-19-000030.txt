ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

Overview 
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify compounds and targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated compounds and targets for pets, primarily dogs, cats and horses. We believe that this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated compounds and targets. Our current portfolio includes one approved product and over 20 product candidates in development, consisting of both small molecules and biologics.
We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2012. The address of our principal executive offices is 1555 Bayshore Highway, Suite 200, Burlingame, CA 94010. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “KindredBio,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”) refer to Kindred Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
Product Highlight


Mirataz® (mirtazapine transdermal ointment), our transdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in May 2018. Mirtazapine, the active ingredient in Mirataz, is a an a2-adrenergic receptor antagonist nor-adrenergic and serotonergic antidepressant drug. Mirtazapine is known to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 serotonin receptors in the central nervous system ("CNS"), and a potent inhibitor of histamine H1 receptors. Because mirtazapine blocks 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, only 5-HT1A- mediated serotonergic transmission is enhanced. Inhibition of 5-HT2 receptors may account for the orexigenic effects of mirtazapine, resulting in weight gain in cats experience unintended weight loss. Mirataz, classified as a weight gain drug by the FDA, became commercially available to U.S. veterinarians on July 9, 2018. 
Mirataz is the first and only FDA approved transdermal medication specifically developed for the management of weight loss in cats. Unintended weight loss is a serious unmet medical need in cats, and may be caused by multiple factors, including chronic illness, like chronic kidney disease, or behavioral issues, such as stress. If untreated, it may lead to hepatic failure, which can be a life-threatening condition. 
Weight loss in cats represents a leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats and a veterinarian will see on average 7 or more cats per week with this condition. Our research estimates that as many as 9,000,000 cats each year are diagnosed with unintended weight loss caused by varying underlying conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cancer or diabetes, with approximately 3,000,000 cats being treated for unintended weight loss each year. Mirataz, which is formulated with our proprietary Accusorb™ technology, is applied topically to the cat’s inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. 74% of veterinarians report that ease of administering medication is a primary factor in selecting medication for feline 
1

weight loss. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.
Clinical Data
The pivotal field study, KB105, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal field study that enrolled 230 cats to assess the effectiveness of Mirataz in managing weight loss in cats. The primary endpoint was percentage change in body weight from Day 1 to Week 2. At Week 2, the mean percent increase in body weight from Day 1 was 3.94% in the KIND-010 group (n=83), versus 0.41% in the placebo group (n=94) (p<0.0001). In the target animal safety study, Mirataz was generally well-tolerated and no significant safety concerns were identified. At the proposed label dose, topical administration of mirtazapine ointment was associated with mild, reversible skin changes at the site of dose application (ear).
Commercialization and Distribution
Mirataz is marketed through our commercial team in conjunction with third-party national and regional distributors, who in turn warehouse, ship, and sell Mirataz to companion animal veterinarians. Our commercial team promotes our product through direct field contact with veterinarians and their staff. We generally grant our third-party distributors, which comprise more than 800 sales representatives, the right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. 

We currently sell and distribute Mirataz in the United States through the wholesale channel. Our combined sales to four large distributors, namely MWI, Henry Schein (now Covetrus), Patterson and Midwest, each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for approximately 91% of our product sales in 2018, with regional and home delivery partners making up the remainder. Mirataz was included in the two largest U.S. corporately owned veterinary groups of pet hospitals (VCA and Banfield Pet Hospital) within six months of launch. The commercial team comes from the top veterinary companies and has on average more than 15 years of experience with over 10 launches per team member. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we recorded $2.0 million in Mirataz net product revenues. In the third quarter of 2018 (the first partial quarter of launch), net product sales were $0.6 million. This result represented initial stocking orders to distribution and subsequent move-out from distribution to clinics to satisfy orders. We took a judicious approach to distribution’s initial stocking orders, preferring smaller initial orders and faster reorders that accurately reflect underlying customer demand, rather than large initial stocking orders that could take time to work through and result in an uneven launch profile. 
 Mirataz had strong uptake in the fourth quarter (the second quarter of launch), with net product revenues more than doubling quarter-over-quarter to $1.3 million. Approximately 33% of the approximate 25,000 veterinary clinics in the U.S. purchased Mirataz in the second half of 2018, which is consistent with our stated goal. During this same period, approximately 56% of veterinary clinics placed re-orders. Customer feedback to date has been uniformly positive. 
As of the date of the filing of this 2018 Annual Report, we continue to see subsequent move-out of Mirataz from distribution into the clinics at an increased rate from what we saw in the first few months of the launch as the sales, distribution, and marketing team’s efforts reach veterinary customers. Having achieved strong uptake to date, 
2

our focus is on driving re-orders and further increasing re-order size. As veterinarians have gained experience and are becoming familiar with the product and its potential uses, our average order sizes have increased quarter over quarter. Throughout the year 2019, we expect continued revenue growth.
In December 2017, the EMA accepted our Mirataz submission for review. We responded to the EMA’s list of questions and expect that Mirataz will be approved by the EMA in 2019. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.
Product Candidates
ZimetaTM (dipyrone injection) (Zimeta IV) 
The FDA has approved the safety and effectiveness technical sections for Zimeta IV for the control of pyrexia (fever) in horses. The FDA has indicated it does not have any additional questions or requests from us regarding the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) technical section. We have filed a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) for Zimeta IV with the FDA.  Pending a positive inspection of the contract manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) dipyrone, FDA approval of Zimeta IV is expected in mid-May 2019. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process. Preparations for the commercial launch remain on track.
Zimeta (dipyrone oral gel) (Zimeta Oral)
The pivotal field effectiveness study for Zimeta Oral has been completed with positive results. The target animal safety study is also complete, and Zimeta Oral was found to be well-tolerated. We have transferred the product to the commercial manufacturer and are in discussions with the FDA and EMA regarding the data required to show bioequivalence to the previously manufactured product. Zimeta Oral, which is a proprietary oral gel, is expected to expand use of the drug and build upon the success of Zimeta IV.
KIND-016 
In October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot effectiveness study of KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Atopic dermatitis is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian, and the current market size is almost $600 million annually and growing rapidly. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.
 The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot laboratory study that enrolled 32 dogs to assess the effectiveness of KIND-016 at three doses. A single dose of KIND-016 was administered on day 0 and itching was induced at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 with an injection of canine IL-31.
 KindredBio's IL-31 antibody resulted in statistically significant reductions in pruritus (p<0.0001 to p<0.05) across all dose groups and was sustained for 6 to 8 weeks, with a clear dose response. The reduction in the itching score was as high as 86.1%. Based on a preliminary review of the safety data, the drug appears to be well tolerated.
We are also currently conducting a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody. 
KIND-014
In May 2018, we announced positive results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. This study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study that enrolled 53 horses (40 horses in three KIND-014 groups with different doses and dosing schedules, 13 horses in the placebo group). The objective was to determine the effective dose of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. At Week 3, the gastric ulcer resolution (gastric ulcer score=0) rates in all three KIND-014 groups were statistically significantly higher than the placebo group (p-values < 0.05). We have selected a formulation for development and anticipate moving into a pivotal field study in 2019. 
epoCatTM (KIND-510a)
3

In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of epoCat (KIND-510a), a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin that is being developed for the management of anemia in cats. 
Anemia is a common condition that is estimated to afflict millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.
epoCat is a recombinant feline erythropoietin that has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life. Erythropoietin is an endogenous protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells.
In the study, which enrolled 23 cats with anemia, epoCat rapidly increased mean hematocrit (a measure of red blood cell count), with statistically significant improvement seen as early as Week 1 (p<0.0001). The effect was sustained, with continued statistically significant improvement at Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (p<0.0001 at each visit). Compared to baseline, the mean peak improvement in hematocrit was 55.4%.
In addition, 95.5% of the 22 evaluable patients achieved treatment success over the 6-week treatment period, defined prospectively as either a 30% increase in hematocrit value over baseline or the hematocrit value reaching normal range. Furthermore, cats treated with epoCat demonstrated statistically significant improvements over baseline (p<0.01 to p<0.05) across all three health-related quality of life (QoL) domains, Vitality, Comfort, and Emotional Wellbeing, as measured by a validated QoL instrument. Based on a preliminary review of the safety data, the drug appears to be well tolerated. We plan to commence a pivotal study this year and are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding study design. The FDA has agreed to accept hematocrit as the primary endpoint for the pivotal study.
KIND-011
The pilot field effectiveness study of our anti-TNF monoclonal antibody targeting sick or septic foals has been completed with positive results. We are now in discussions with the FDA regarding the pivotal study design. Sepsis in foals can cause up to 50% mortality and is an important unmet medical need. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. We intend to continue field studies during the 2020 foaling season, following discussion with the FDA regarding the development plan.
KIND-509
The pilot field efficacy study for our anti-TNF antibody for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been initiated and is currently enrolling. IBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs.
In addition, we have multiple other product candidates, including several biologics, in various stages of development, with the potential to launch one or more products annually.
Market Overview
We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets. We plan to commercialize our feline, equine and canine products in the United States through a direct sales force complemented by selected distributor relationships, and in the European Union (the “EU”) through distributors and other third parties. 
Relative to human drug development, the development of pet therapeutics is generally faster and less expensive, since it requires fewer clinical studies involving fewer subjects and can be conducted directly in the target species. For example, studies that are typically required for approval of human drugs such as QTC studies, 
4

which detect cardiac irregularities, elderly patient studies, renal impairment studies, hepatic impairment studies or costly, long-term genotoxicity studies are not required for pet therapeutics. Based on our progress since inception in September 2012, we believe we can develop small molecule pet therapeutics from the Investigational New Animal Drug (the “INAD”) filing with the FDA to marketing approval in three to five years at an average cost of approximately $5 million per product candidate. The lower cost associated with the development of pet therapeutics permits us to pursue multiple product candidates simultaneously and avoid the binary outcome associated with the development of a single lead therapy by some human biotechnology companies. Because we typically develop drugs that have successfully been developed for humans, the active ingredients in many of our small molecule product candidates also have established Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, which are important gating factors in the regulatory approval process. As a result, we usually do not need to invest in an active pharmaceutical ingredient, process development to comply with good manufacturing practices (“GMP”), standards for our small molecule product candidates, and we can often advance our programs more rapidly than if we were pursuing new chemical entities.
Our biologics program, from INAD to marketing approval, is expected to take four to six years at an average cost of approximately $8 million per product candidate.
We estimate that the total U.S. market for veterinary care was approximately $72.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 67% from 2008. In 2016, 68% of households owned a pet, which translates to an estimated 89.7 million dogs and 94.2 million cats currently living in the United States. We believe there are many unmet or underserved medical needs and that the pet therapeutics portion of the market can grow significantly as new, safe and effective therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed. We expect continued market growth as new pet therapeutics are developed and owners grow more familiar with the treatment of pets with such therapeutics.
We are also targeting the equine market because we have promising products for the equine sector and because we believe that it shares many similarities with the orphan human market. There are fewer horses than dogs or cats, but the willingness to pay is substantially higher. In addition, the cost of building a commercial infrastructure is much less for the equine market. We believe that a dozen or fewer sales representatives are sufficient to launch and support an equine product nationally.
Management Team
Our management team’s extensive experience in both human and animal drug development has enabled us to quickly establish our product pipeline and should continue to enable us to promptly obtain Protocol Concurrences from the FDA for our product candidates and to conduct the clinical trials. Our management team also has extensive experience in biologics, including in the development of antibodies such as Lucentis, Tysabri, Xolair, and Rituxan.

Richard Chin, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer, was previously Head of Clinical Research for the Biotherapeutics Unit at Genentech, Inc., where he oversaw Phase I through Phase IV clinical programs for all products except oncology. Denise Bevers, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has over 20 years of experience in clinical operations and medical affairs. She previously held leadership positions at Elan Pharmaceuticals, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, Quintiles, and SkyePharma. Wendy Wee, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 30 years of experience and most recently was Vice President of Finance and Principal Accounting Officer at Telik, Inc. Hangjun Zhan, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer, is a well-established protein biochemist and biophysicist with over 20 years of drug discovery experience in the biotechnology industry.
Product Pipeline 
Our current product pipeline consists of small molecules and biologics for a range of indications in dogs, cats and horses, with near-term focus on equine small molecule products and canine and feline biologics products.
The US Department of Agriculture’s (the “USDA”) Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding under which animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics, if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not 
5

immunological or is undefined. Although we believe that most of our current animal biologics will be regulated by the USDA based on their mechanisms of action, certain of our animal biologics will be regulated by the FDA instead of the USDA.
We are currently pursuing over 20 indications with various small molecule and biologics product candidates. The following table illustrates some of the product candidates that we are developing.

Product Selection and Development
We utilize a rigorous screening and review process to identify compounds and targets that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans. Where possible, we try to identify compounds that have already demonstrated efficacy in the target companion animal species and address unmet medical needs in veterinary medicine. In some cases, we identify a chemical or functional equivalent of a validated human drug that addresses the same biological target or pathway. We review these compounds and targets with a view to differentiating them from existing treatments, including human products used extra-label in animals, based on ease of administration, method of delivery, dosing regimen, and other similar factors. Previously approved drugs that are found to have an idiosyncratic side effect in humans fit well with our target criteria, since such drugs are often no longer available for human use and could potentially be well suited for companion animals. We then develop these compounds for dogs, cats or horses for regulatory approval in the United States and the EU. 
For our small molecule product candidates, we customize the dosage, formulation, flavor and other characteristics of the product candidate before initiating pivotal clinical trials. In some cases, we reformulate the drug to have a longer half-life or into a form that is easier to administer for certain species. Pet therapeutics that are palatable to animals can command premium prices and significant market share, as evidenced by the still-dominant position of Rimadyl compared to generics. Usually, the active ingredients in our small molecule product candidates are already available as a GMP-quality API. We target small molecule product candidates for which the active ingredient has not been previously approved for use in animals. If we are the first to gain approval for the use of such an active ingredient in animals, our small molecule product will enjoy five years of marketing exclusivity in the United States and ten years in the EU for the approved indication. Where appropriate, we also will seek patents and trademarks to provide added intellectual property protection in addition to the five or ten-year marketing 
6

exclusivity. In addition, we plan to introduce improved formulations, combination products and other product improvements in order to extend the lifecycle of our products.
Biologic therapies are typically derived from living organisms. A biologic can be defined as a large complex molecule (nucleic acid and protein platforms) produced from or extracted from a biological or living system. They are made by genetically engineering living cells, and a high level of precision is required in the manufacturing process to produce a consistent biologic product each time. A biologic product can be a monoclonal antibody, a vaccine, a tissue, or various proteins such as cytokines, enzymes, fusion proteins, whole cells, and viral and non-viral gene therapies. Our biologic product candidates are usually based on therapies and targets for which products have been successfully commercialized for humans. Human antibody therapies are expensive and are often ineffective in other species since they are usually immunogenic or recognized as foreign bodies and rejected by the immune systems of dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. We identify or create biologics, including antibodies, that are fully or mostly canine, feline, or equine. We are developing a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin. We are also developing antibodies that target canine IL-31, IL-4/IL-13, IL-17a, TNF, CD-20, IgE, and other validated targets. We generally intend to seek composition-of-matter and other patents for these new biologics.
KIND-Bodies, a unique biologics scaffold with certain advantages over traditional monoclonal antibodies, including bispecific binding, is also under development.
We have an in-house laboratory capable of protein engineering, cell line development, analytics, and other activities necessary for advancing a world-class biologics pipeline. We believe that we have one of the best biologics teams in the pharmaceutical industry, drawn from some of the top biotechnology companies.
We have constructed a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Burlingame, California for our initial biologic product candidates, which we believe is one of the first GMP biologics plants for veterinary products. We started GMP manufacturing in January 2018 and believe that the plant will position us as a leader in the veterinary biologics field, and potentially afford us an advantage in cost of goods for our products. We acquired a second manufacturing plant in August 2017 in Elwood, Kansas and construction to support our initial production lines is expected to be completed by mid-2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for small molecule and biologics manufacturing.
Our small molecule product candidates, if approved, may eventually face generic competition in the United States and in the EU. In the United States, a generic animal drug may be approved pursuant to an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application ("ANADA"). Instead of demonstrating the drug’s safety and effectiveness in the target species as required in a NADA, a generic applicant must only show that the proposed generic product is the same as, and bioequivalent to, the approved brand name product. However, if our product candidates are the first approved by the FDA or the EMA as applicable for use in animals, they will be eligible for five years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States and ten years in the EU. There is no comparable pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.

Business Strategy 
Key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on the long-term success of Mirataz
Having achieved strong uptake to date, our focus is on driving re-orders and further increasing re-order size. As veterinarians have gained trial experience and are becoming familiar with the product and the potential uses, our average order sizes have increased quarter over quarter.
Obtain FDA approval for Zimeta IV and EMA approval for Mirataz and launch products in the second half of 2019
In November 2015, we announced positive topline results from a pivotal trial of Zimeta (dipyrone injection), also known as KIND-012, for the control of pyrexia (fever) in horses. The FDA has approved the safety 
7

and effectiveness technical sections for Zimeta IV and has indicated it does not have any additional questions or requests from us regarding the CMC technical section. We have filed a NADA for Zimeta IV with the FDA.  Pending a positive inspection of the contract manufacturer of the API, dipyrone, FDA approval of Zimeta IV is expected in mid-2019. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process. Preparations for the commercial launch remain on track.
The EMA has accepted our European marketing authorization application for the review of Mirataz with the official acceptance date of December 21, 2017. We responded to the EMA’s list of questions or LOQ and expect that Mirataz will be approved by the EMA in 2019. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.
Continue to focus on the development of our pipeline
We expect to initiate pivotal field studies for epoCat, IL-31 antibody and KIND-014 in 2019. We are currently developing KIND-015 for the management of clinical signs associated with equine metabolic syndrome and anti-TNF in septic foals. In addition to early stage pilot efficacy studies of IL-4/IL-13 antibodies for atopic dermatitis in dogs and KIND-509 for inflammatory bowel disease in dogs, we are also developing multiple other products, including interleukin antibodies and canine checkpoint inhibitors. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications for dogs, cats, and horses.
Continue to focus on cost-effective research and development execution
In order to execute our studies rapidly and efficiently, we have built an experienced team drawn from both the veterinary and human pharmaceutical industries. We rely primarily on our own personnel or independent contractors, rather than on contract research organizations (“CROs”), for many business-critical tasks, including protocol designs, regulatory interactions, statistics, data management and clinical operations. By doing so, we believe we can maintain higher quality, achieve lower costs and seek regulatory approval more quickly. Since our inception in September 2012, we have been able to quickly and efficiently build and advance our pipeline.
Leverage our antibody and biologics experience
Members of our team have extensive experience developing biologics such as antibodies. We are leveraging their expertise to identify and develop antibody-based therapies for pets based on approved human therapies, and to identify appropriate manufacturing technologies for these product candidates.
Leverage our current product pipeline in additional animal species
We intend to develop our product candidates primarily for approval in one or more indications in dogs, cats and horses. We believe the market for horse therapeutics may be particularly attractive, as it can be targeted by a limited sales force and has potentially less price sensitivity than therapeutic treatments for dogs and cats, because horse owners are willing to spend more on treatments for these more expensive companion animals. As an example, a one-month supply of omeprazole for a horse can cost over a thousand dollars. We may consider the development of our current or future product candidates for additional species in the future, but our pipeline currently is focused on dogs, cats and horses only.
Expand our pipeline with additional product candidates
We actively seek to identify small molecule and biologic therapeutics, or in some cases therapeutic targets, that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans, focusing on small molecules that are already marketed for humans or biologics for which there are no animal counterparts. These therapeutics typically have been tested in animals such as dogs as part of standard toxicology studies in human clinical development. We have identified over 30 additional product candidates in the pre-INAD stage that we may potentially pursue. We will seek to protect our product candidates through a combination of regulatory exclusivity periods in the United States and in the EU, patents, know-how and other customary means.
8

Commercialize our equine products with our own direct sales force in the United States and with distributors in other regions
In conjunction with FDA approval of one or more of our lead equine product candidates, we intend to utilize a direct sales organization, complimented by select distributor relationships, to market our products directly to veterinarians in the United States. For our equine products, we believe we can accomplish this with a sales force of 4 to 12 sales representatives and reach most of the prescribing equine veterinarians in the United States. We also intend to establish collaborations with distributors to commercialize any of our products that may be approved by the EMA.
Commercialize our canine and feline products with our own direct sales force in the United States and with distributors in other regions
We currently utilize a direct sales organization, complimented by select distributor relationships, to market our first approved product directly to veterinarians in the United States. With Mirataz’s FDA approval, we established a 37-person direct sales force, (equivalent to a sales force with 25 field territories also supported by Inside Sales, Strategic Account Sales and Sales Management) supplemented by sales support from our distributors. We intend to grow our direct sales force incrementally if and as additional product candidates are approved for marketing or as our current products can support, and to utilize national and regional distributors to augment our sales force. 

Pet Therapeutics Market
Overview 
U.S. consumers spent an estimated $72.1 billion on their pets in 2018, according to the American Pet Products Association (“APPA”) an increase of 67% from 2008. The veterinary care segment has been among the fastest growing segments of the overall U.S. pet market. This segment accounted for an estimated $18.3 billion spent on veterinary care in 2018, an increase of 65% from 2008.
We believe several factors will contribute to an increase in spending on pet therapeutics. Pets are generally living longer, with the average lifespan for dogs increasing by nearly a year to 12 years and 13.1 years for cats between 2012 and 2016 according to a study by Banfield Pet Hospitals. As a result, pets are increasingly exhibiting many of the same diseases associated with aging in humans such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes. For example, the incidence of diabetes in dogs has increased by 79.7% since 2006, while in felines, the prevalence of diabetes in cats has increased 18.1% over the same timeframe. The incidence of osteoarthritis in dogs has increased by 82% since 2006 according to the same study. As it is with human health, obesity is a growing concern for pets. The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention estimates that in 2017, 56% of dogs and 60% of cats are overweight or obese, which translates to 50.2 million dogs and 65.5 million cats. According to a 2016 study, in the past 10 years Banfield Pet Hospitals witnessed a 169 percent increase in overweight cats and a 158 percent increase in overweight dogs. Banfield further reports that obesity in cats and dogs has been linked to more than 20 ailments. Not surprisingly then, Banfield’s records indicate dog owners spend 17% more on healthcare costs and nearly 25% more on medications versus owners of healthy-weight dogs. In addition, pet ownership numbers may increase as more people become aware of the myriad health benefits of pet ownership. According to the Human Animal Bond Research Institute, studies show that some of the benefits of having a dog include helping to lower your blood pressure, decrease your risk of heart disease, and preventing allergies in children.
Among pet owners, there is growing familiarity in treating these pet diseases with medications. According to the APPA, approximately 77% of U.S. dog owners treated their dogs with medications in 2015, an increase of over 50% from the level reported in 2004. In a 2010 poll by the Associated Press, 35% of pet owners are willing to spend $2,000 to treat their pet for a serious medical condition. More recently, a 2017 Harris Poll by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants indicated that 76% of the U.S. adults (1,004, of which 526 identified as pet owners) surveyed would make financial sacrifices for their pets to pay for an emergency expense such as medical care. Additionally, 79% said they would stop eating at restaurants and 67% would give up a vacation to pay for pet-related expenses if they were in a difficult financial situation. Respondents also indicated that they would cancel cable and TV streaming services (61%), sacrifice contributions to their retirement account (37%), cancel a cell 
9

phone plan (35%), or forego paying a credit card bill (27%) to pay for their pet’s expenses. We expect pet owners to spend more on their pets’ health and welfare as new therapeutics are developed specifically for pets, particularly as 95% of pet owners considered their pet to be a member of their family, according to a 2015 survey by the Harris Poll of Harris Interactive.
Pet Therapeutics Market Dynamics
The respective businesses of developing and commercializing therapeutics for pets and for humans share a number of characteristics, including the need to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for marketing, manufacture the therapeutics in facilities compliant with GMP requirements and market the therapeutics only for their intended indication based on claims permitted in the product label, and not for other uses, which is referred to as extra-label use.
Despite their similarities, there are a number of important differences between the pet therapeutics and human therapeutics businesses, including:

• | Faster, less expensive and more predictable development. The development of pet therapeutics requires fewer clinical studies in fewer subject animals than the development of human therapeutics and, unlike human therapeutics, is conducted directly in the target animals. We believe our strategy of selecting compounds and targets with demonstrated efficacy and safety in humans enhances the predictability of results and probability of success of our pivotal trials relative to compounds and targets that have not been previously validated.


• | Role and incentives for veterinary practices. In the United States, veterinarians generally serve the dual role of doctor and pharmacist, and pet owners typically purchase medicines directly from their veterinarians. Therapeutics specifically developed for pets enable veterinarians to provide potentially superior treatment options, while also increasing revenue from the sale of these therapeutics.


• | Primarily private-pay nature of veterinary market. Pet owners in the United States generally pay for pet therapeutics out-of-pocket, and 10% of dog owners and 5% of cat owners have health insurance for their pets. As a result, pet owners must make decisions primarily on their veterinarians’ advice regarding available treatment options, rather than on the treatment options’ eligibility for reimbursement by insurance companies or government payers. We believe this results in less pricing pressure than in human healthcare, although the limited adoption of insurance may also reduce pet owners’ ability to pay for therapeutics recommended by their veterinarians.


• | Less generic competition and strong brand loyalty. There is less generic competition in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human healthcare industry. Approximately 14% of veterinary drugs face generic competition, and the percentage of generic prescriptions in the veterinary space is only 7% as compared to approximately 81% for human drugs. For example, Rimadyl, the leading U.S. pet NSAID, lost regulatory exclusivity in 2001, but its sales continued to grow since generic competition was introduced in 2005. We believe that stronger brand loyalty and lack of mandatory generic drug substitution, as in human pharmaceuticals, partially explains the low penetration of generics in veterinary medicine.

Unmet Medical Needs in the Pet Therapeutics Market
Despite the growing market for pet therapeutics, there are relatively few treatment options approved for use in pets as compared to human therapeutic treatments. As a result, veterinarians often must resort to prescribing products approved for use in humans but not approved, formulated or even formally studied in pets. Veterinarians must then rely upon trial and error or untested rules of thumb to assess the proper dosage needed to be effective in the particular species without undue risk of side effects. The veterinarian must also find a way to administer the human product in animals and determine the appropriate dose to treat the disease in the species, which are important and potentially overlooked practical considerations in the treatment of pets.
Even in disease categories with approved pet therapeutics, significant unmet medical needs remain. For example, the NSAID class of products, commonly prescribed for pain, have potentially serious side effects in dogs 
10

that limit their long-term use and may require ongoing monitoring by veterinarians. The treatment of pain in cats is further complicated as a result of their differing biology, which makes NSAIDs toxic.
Animal health companies have been relatively slow to develop new therapeutics for pets and have tended to focus primarily on the larger market for the treatment of livestock and other farm animals. In 2018 in the United States, for every 19 NDAs approved for human therapeutics, one NADA was approved for animal therapeutics. Human pharmaceutical companies received FDA approval for 59 novel drugs (non-generic), while pet therapeutic companies received only three novel FDA drug approvals. In the EU, human pharmaceutical companies received EMA approval for 42 novel drugs in 2018, compared to only 3 novel drug approvals for pet therapeutic companies. 
We believe that therapeutics specifically developed for pets can extend and improve pets’ quality of life, help veterinarians achieve improved medical outcomes and make the process of administering therapeutics to pets much more convenient. Advances in human medicines have created new therapeutics for managing chronic diseases associated with aging, such as osteoarthritis, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Pets often suffer from the same disease as humans, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease (canine cognitive dysfunction), lupus, Crohn’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease (degenerative myelopathy) and others. In most cases, the biologies of the diseases in pets are very similar to those in humans. Because of the similarity of the diseases, many human drugs, when formulated properly and administered in proper doses, are effective in pets. However, most human drugs are neither formulated nor approved for animals.
Products in Development
Zimeta (dipyrone injection)
Overview
Zimeta IV, also known as KIND-012, is a pyrazolone anti-inflammatory drug, with a mechanism of action unlike traditional NSAIDs. The active ingredient in Zimeta, dipyrone, is widely used both for horses and humans as an antipyretic outside of the United States. It is also considered to be an anti-spasmodic that can be used in horses without masking the surgical signs of colic.
In humans, the active ingredient in Zimeta can, in very rare cases, cause bone marrow suppression. In some countries, it is still available as prescription or over the counter medication, while in other countries, it has been withdrawn from market. However, the side effects are not seen in horses, and the product is widely used outside the U.S. by many equine veterinarians.
We are developing Zimeta for the control of pyrexia (fever) in horses. The FDA has approved the safety and effectiveness technical sections for Zimeta IV and has indicated it does not have any additional questions or requests from us regarding the CMC technical section. We have filed a NADA for Zimeta IV with the FDA. Pending a positive inspection of the contract manufacturer of the API dipyrone, FDA approval of Zimeta IV is expected in mid-2019. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process. Preparations for the commercial launch remain on track.
The active ingredient in Zimeta IV is available as GMP-grade material from two suppliers, and we believe our current manufacturer or other suppliers will be able to provide sufficient quantities for commercialization. In addition, we executed a commercial manufacturing agreement with Corden Pharma SPA for the manufacture of Zimeta IV. The agreement provides for production to supply KindredBio’s initial launch and future commercial campaigns upon regulatory approval, with capabilities to meet excess demand.
Clinical Data
The pivotal field study was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 138 horses to assess the effectiveness of Zimeta IV. The primary endpoint was improvement (a 2°F or greater decrease in temperature from baseline) or resolution of fever (a return to normothermia (≤101.0°F)) at hour 6 following treatment. The success rate was approximately 75% in the KIND-012 group vs. approximately 20% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).  
11

We have also completed the pivotal field effectiveness study of ZimetaTM Oral (dipyrone oral gel) for the treatment of fever in horses and announced positive topline results in December 2017. This study was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 139 horses to assess the effectiveness of Zimeta Oral. The primary endpoint was improvement or resolution of fever 6 hours after treatment. The success rate was approximately 78% in the Zimeta Oral group vs. approximately 18% in the placebo group (p = 0.0026). The target animal safety study is also complete, and Zimeta Oral was found to be well-tolerated. We have transferred the product to the commercial manufacturer and are in discussions with the FDA and EMA regarding the data required to show bioequivalence to the previously manufactured product. Zimeta Oral, which is a proprietary oral gel, is expected to expand use of the drug and build upon the success of Zimeta IV.
Other Product Candidates
epoCat, or KIND-510a, is a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin that is being developed for the management of anemia in cats. Anemia is a common condition that is estimated to afflict millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.
epoCat is a recombinant feline erythropoietin that has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life. Erythropoietin is an endogenous protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells.
In January 2019, we reported positive topline results from the pilot field effectiveness study of our enhanced version of epoCat. In the study, which enrolled 23 cats with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease, epoCat rapidly increased mean hematocrit, with statistically significant improvement as early as Week 1 (p<0.0001). The effect was sustained, with continued statistically significant improvement at Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (p<0.0001 at each visit). Compared to baseline, the mean of peak percent improvement in hematocrit by Week 6 was 55.4%.
Canine atopic dermatitis (“CAD”) is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling close to $600 million per year. 
In October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot effectiveness study of KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. 
The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot laboratory study that enrolled 32 dogs to assess the effectiveness of KIND-016 at three doses. A single dose of KIND-016 was administered on day 0 and itching was induced at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 with an injection of canine IL-31.
KindredBio's IL-31 antibody resulted in statistically significant reductions in pruritus (p<0.0001 to p<0.05) across all dose groups and was sustained for 6 to 8 weeks, with a clear dose response. The reduction in the itching score was as high as 86.1%. Based on a preliminary review of the safety data, the drug appears to be well tolerated.
We are also currently conducting a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody. We continue to expect pilot efficacy results for our canine anti-IL-4/IL-13 SINK molecule in 2019 and are advancing other programs for atopic dermatitis. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics.
In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.
KIND-011 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (“anti-TNF”) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score ≥ 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging and difficult to treat and result in approximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in 
12

survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). We intend to continue field studies during the 2020 foaling season. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy and we are now in discussions with the FDA regarding the pivotal study design for KIND-011. 
KIND-509 is an antibody that targets the canine TNF. The pilot field efficacy study for our anti-TNF antibody for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been initiated and is currently enrolling. The group of gastrointestinal diseases known as IBD results in the inflammation of the intestines and chronic symptoms related to gastrointestinal system, in particular diarrhea, chronic intermittent vomiting and weight loss. IBD can affect dogs at any age but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs. 
Our other promising biologic product candidates in our pipeline with key focus areas of atopic dermatitis and cancer include: KIND-502, an IgE antibody that targets the canine counterpart of the human target for Xolair, for allergic and immune-mediated diseases; KIND-0888, an antibody that targets CD20; and several antibodies that target cytokines involved in atopic dermatitis.
In addition to biologics, we have the following small molecule programs:
KIND-014 is a small molecule product candidate we are developing for treatment of equine gastric ulcers in horses. In May 2018, we announced positive results from the pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. The study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study that enrolled 53 horses (40 horses in three KIND-014 groups with different doses and dosing schedules, 13 horses in the placebo group). The objective was to determine the effective dose of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. At Week 3, the gastric ulcer resolution (gastric ulcer score=0) rates in all three KIND-014 groups were statistically significantly higher than the placebo group (p-values < 0.05). We have selected a formulation for development and anticipate moving into a pivotal field study in 2019. 
Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is a common condition in horses which encompasses primary and secondary erosive and ulcerative diseases of both the squamous and glandular parts of the stomach. It affects approximately half of all horses. A variety of clinical signs are associated with EGUS, including poor appetite, poor condition, colic, and behavioral issues. 
KIND-015 is a small molecule product we are developing for the management of clinical signs associated with equine metabolic syndrome (“EMS”). EMS is an endocrinopathy affecting horses and ponies. It is of primary concern due to its link to obesity, insulin resistance, and subsequent laminitis which is a painful and debilitating disease of the digital laminae (the tissue inter-connection between the coffin bone and hoof wall).  Often by the time clinical signs are recognized, crippling body changes such as sinking and rotation of the coffin bone have occurred. KIND-015 delays absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, increases insulin sensitivity (enhancing peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin) and glucose uptake into cells, and inhibits synthesis of glucose by the liver. We have initiated a pilot field effectiveness study. 
Product Launches and Commercialization
Our executive management team has extensive experience with product launches. Richard Chin, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer, and Denise Bevers, our President and Chief Operating Officer, have each been involved in the launch of numerous products in humans, including such drugs as Tysabri and Xolair. Other members of the KindredBio team have experience with multiple product launches for companion animals.
If our equine product candidates are approved by the FDA, we intend to establish a direct sales organization to market our products directly to veterinarians in the United States. For our equine products, we believe we can do this with a sales force of 4 to 12 sales representatives and reach most of the prescribing equine veterinarians in the United States. We also intend to establish collaborations with distributors to commercialize any of our products that may be approved with the EMA.
Our direct sales force sells products directly to veterinarians, who typically mark up the pet therapeutics they prescribe for pet owners. According to industry sources, approximately one-third of pet veterinary practice revenue comes from prescription drug sales, vaccinations and non-prescription medicines. We believe veterinarians 
13

are self-motivated to prescribe innovative therapeutics that are safe, effective, and supported by reliable clinical data and regulatory approval in order to improve the health of pets, while also generating additional revenue.
Animal health companies commonly use wholesale veterinary distributors to inventory, sell, bill and ship products to independent veterinarians. We estimate that the top three national distributors are responsible for fulfillment of over 70% of U.S. pet sales by veterinarians. Each of these distributor organizations has a sales team of approximately 281 field sales representatives, 147 telesales representatives and a dozen distribution centers geographically placed throughout the United States. We intend to grow our direct sales force incrementally if and as our product candidates are approved for marketing, and to utilize national and regional distributors to augment our sales force.
Manufacturing
We have no internal manufacturing capabilities for small molecule drug products. To ensure dependable and high-quality supply of the API in our toxicology studies and pivotal trials, we rely on GMP-compliant contract manufacturers for small molecules rather than devote capital and resources toward developing or acquiring our own manufacturing facilities. Our selection process for small molecule products takes into account the availability of established and cost-effective GMP manufacturing before proceeding to an INAD filing. We believe that contract manufacturers can manufacture these supplies more cheaply than we could on our own.
We have a sufficient supply of formulated drugs for Mirataz and expect to have a sufficient supply for our potential launch of Zimeta. We also have identified multiple potential contract manufacturers to provide commercial supplies of future formulated drug product candidates if they are approved for marketing. We have or intend to secure contract manufacturers with established track records of quality product supply and significant experience with regulatory requirements of the FDA and the EMA.
For biologics, we have established our own GMP manufacturing capabilities in Burlingame, California and proceeded to GMP manufacturing in January 2018. In August 2017, we acquired a manufacturing facility in Elwood, Kansas and expect to complete construction to support initial production lines in mid-2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing. The USDA regulates the manufacture of pet biologics under standards that are less stringent than those for human biologics, which may reduce the cost of goods of our biologic product candidates relative to human biologics.
While we and our contract manufacturers have historically been able to obtain supplies of the API for development of our small molecule product candidates, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply agreements with the API manufacturers. We also have no agreements for commercial-scale supply of the API or manufacture of any of our product candidates. As a result, we and our contract manufacturers may be unable to procure API in a timely manner on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
Competition
While there are fewer competitors in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human pharmaceutical industry, the development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies.
Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, which currently derive the majority of their revenue from livestock medications. For example, in 2018 livestock accounted for 54%, and pets 45%, of sales for Zoetis, a large company focused on animal health. Within the pet therapeutics market, vaccines and parasiticides are currently the greatest sources of revenue.
Large animal health companies include Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Elanco Animal Health Incorporated; and Zoetis, Inc. We will also compete against several animal health companies in Europe, such as the Virbac Group, Ceva Animal 
14

Health and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of smaller companies that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market, including Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.
At the product level, we will face competition for Mirataz from Entyce, if used off-label or eventually approved for cats, for Zimeta from Banamine and Butazolidin even though they are not approved for control of fever in horses, for KIND-014 from GastroGard and UlcerGard and potentially from additional products in development. In addition, we may face competition from various products including additional products in development. Our products may also face competition from generic medicines and products approved for use in humans that are used extra-label for pets. Some of our other products also may face competition from their human generic equivalents in countries where such equivalents are available.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines, including pet therapeutics. In addition, these and other potential competing products may benefit from greater brand recognition and brand loyalty than any that our product candidates may achieve. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we and our products can compete effectively.
Intellectual Property
We intend to rely primarily upon a combination of regulatory exclusivity, patents, trade secret protection, proprietary know-how, license agreements, and confidentiality agreements to protect our product formulations, biologics, processes, therapeutic methods and other technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We currently have numerous provisional, nonprovisional, and international patent applications pending, and two issued patents, for our IL-31 antibody compositions-of-matter and corresponding methods of use. Because our first approved product and our other small molecule product candidates are based on generic human drugs, there is little, if any, composition-of-matter patent protection available for the API in such product candidates. Where feasible, however, we are pursuing the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our small molecule products, such as patent protection of enhanced formulations of our products and associated methods of use, both in the United States and abroad. For example, we are developing slow release oral formulations or transdermal formulations of some of our products. We also intend to develop combination therapies and slow release parenteral formulations of some of our products. In addition, we have filed patent applications on many of our biologic products. However, even intellectual property protection, if available to us, may not afford us with complete protection against competitors. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our management personnel, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into customary confidentiality and inventions agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Regulatory 
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to sell our products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development and launch of our products and their maintenance in the market. 
United States 
15

Three federal regulatory agencies regulate the health aspects of animal health products in the United States: the FDA; the USDA; and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. 
The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (the “CVM”), regulates animal pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (the “CVB”), regulates veterinary vaccines and certain biologics pursuant to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs (the “OPP”) regulates veterinary pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Many topical products used for treatment of flea and tick infestations are regulated by the EPA.

All of our current product candidates are animal pharmaceuticals or biologics regulated by the CVM or the CVB, respectively. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals and biologics, including us, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. We are also required to conduct post-approval monitoring of products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results, and are subject to regulatory inspection from time to time. In addition, for our controlled substance product candidates, we are required to comply with the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and related state laws regarding manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. 
Requirements for Approval of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals for Pets 
As a condition to regulatory approval for the sale of animal products, regulatory agencies worldwide generally require that a product to be used for pets be demonstrated to: 
•    be safe for the intended use in the intended species;

• | have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use;


• | have a defined manufacturing process that ensures the product can be made with high quality consistency; and


• | be safe for humans handling the product and for the environment.

Safety. To determine that a new veterinary drug is safe for use, most regulatory authorities will require us to provide data from a safety study generated in laboratory cats, dogs, and horses tested at doses higher than the intended label dose, over a period of time determined by the intended length of dosing of the product. In the case of the FDA, the design and review of the safety study and the study protocol can be completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including GLP, to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. In addition, safety data from pivotal field studies conducted under GCP standards are evaluated to assure that the product will be safe in the target population. Furthermore, because safety and effectiveness studies must conform to VICH guidelines, which are established under an international program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration, they can be utilized by regulatory bodies in the European Union, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

Effectiveness. Early pilot studies may be conducted in laboratory cats, dogs, or horses to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. Data on how well the drug is absorbed when dosed by different routes of administration and the relationship of the dose to the effectiveness are studied. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. In the case of the FDA, the pivotal effectiveness field study protocol can be submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet requirements. 
The pivotal field effectiveness study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, generally with a placebo control. To reduce bias in the study, individuals doing the assessment are not told whether the subject is in the group receiving the treatment being tested or the placebo group. In both the United States and the European Union, the number of 
16

subjects enrolled in pivotal field effectiveness studies is required to be approximately 100 to 150 animal subjects treated with the test product and a comparable number of subjects in the control group that receive the placebo. In many cases, a pivotal field study may be designed with clinical sites in both the European Union and the United States, and this single study may satisfy regulatory requirements in both jurisdictions. 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC"). To assure that the product can be manufactured consistently, regulatory agencies will require us to provide documentation of the process by which the API is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the API and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including quality, purity and stability. After a product is approved, we will be required to communicate with the regulatory bodies any changes in the procedures or manufacturing site. Both API and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice pharmaceutical GMP.
Environmental and Human Safety. We will not be required under United States law to provide an environmental impact statement for products currently in development if the products are given at the home of the pet’s owner or in a veterinary hospital. If products might result in some type of environmental exposure or release, the environmental impact must be assessed. For approval in the EU, a risk assessment for potential human exposure will be required.
Labeling, All Other Information, and Freedom of Information Summary. We also will be required to submit the intended label for the product, and also any information regarding additional research that has been conducted with the drug, to the CVM and other regulatory bodies for review. We will draft, and submit for regulatory review, the Freedom of Information Summary for use in the United States. This summary outlines the studies and provides substantial information that the FDA uses to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and then publishes on its website.
Regulatory Process at the FDA 
To begin the development process for products in the United States, we must file an Investigational New Animal Drug ("INAD") submission with the FDA. We will then usually hold a pre-development meeting with the FDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an NADA. During development, we will usually submit pivotal protocols to the FDA for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We will gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the FDA for review, and this review will be conducted according to timelines specified in the Animal Drug User Fee Act. These are called technical sections, which collectively form the basis of the NADA. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical section - safety, effectiveness and CMC - the FDA will issue us a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed, and when the three letters have been issued, we will compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these for FDA review. An administrative NADA is a NADA that is submitted after all of the technical sections that fulfill the requirements for the approval of the new animal drug have been reviewed by the CVM and the CVM has issued a technical section complete letter for each of those technical sections. Although this process is not required and submission of a non-administrative NADA is also acceptable, we plan to take advantage of the administrative NADA process to obtain a more timely, phased review. Because the CVM has already reviewed the individual technical sections before the administrative NADA is filed, the CVM is committed under its user fee agreements to reviewing and acting on 90% of administrative NADAs within 60 days after submission. The CVM user fee goal is to review and act on 90% of non-administrative NADAs within 180 days after submission. After approval, we will be required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to the FDA. 
Regulatory Process at the USDA 
To begin the development process for veterinary biologics products in the United States, we typically file an Application for United States Veterinary Biological Product License with the USDA. For the biologics products that we develop, we may then meet with the USDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an approval. During development, we gather and submit data on manufacturing, purity and potency to the USDA for review. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed, the USDA will issue its decision. Unlike the FDA, there are no timelines specified by law for the USDA’s review. 
17

In some cases, it may be unclear whether our product candidates meet the definition of a biological product subject to regulation by the USDA or a drug subject to regulation by the FDA. The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding concerning their joint responsibilities for resolving jurisdictional issues over products of this nature. Under the memorandum of understanding, animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not immunological or is undefined. 
Regulatory Process at the EMA 
The EMA is responsible for coordinating scientific evaluation of applications for marketing approval for pet therapeutics in the EU. Its veterinary review section is distinct from the review section for human drugs. To perform these evaluations the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ("CVMP"). The CVMP considers applications submitted by companies for the marketing approval of individual pet therapeutics and evaluates whether or not the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in the pet population for which they are intended. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the EMA, which allows the product to be marketed in any of the EU states, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. 
To obtain authorization from the EMA, we must submit a marketing authorization application called a dossier. The dossier is the EMA’s equivalent of the FDA’s NADA and includes data from studies showing the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. The CVMP reviews and evaluates the dossier. For any dossier, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the members of the CVMP. Their role is to lead the scientific evaluation and prepare the assessment report. The rapporteur can utilize experts to assist it in performing its assessment. The report is critiqued by the co-rapporteur and other members of the CVMP before the CVMP makes its determination. The final opinion of the CVMP is generally given within 210 days of the submission of a dossier, but the EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. In general, the requirements for regulatory approval of an animal health product in the EU are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes. 
Alternatively, product approval applications may be submitted directly to the regulatory authority in each country rather than by centralized approval by the EMA. 
Regulatory Processes at the DEA 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. An animal drug may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Certain of our product candidates are likely to be scheduled as controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use will be subject to a high degree of regulation. 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for 
18

example, distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. 
Other Regulatory Considerations 
Regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our products are not intended for use in food animals or food production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada. 
Advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in the United States and other countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and authorized by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell pet therapeutics.

Our small molecule product candidates, if approved, may eventually face generic competition in the United States and in the EU. In the United States, a generic animal drug may be approved pursuant to an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application ("ANADA"). Instead of demonstrating the drug’s safety and effectiveness in the target species as required in a NADA, a generic applicant must only show that the proposed generic product is the same as, and bioequivalent to, the approved brand name product. However, if our product candidates are the first approved by the FDA or the EMA as applicable for use in animals, they will be eligible for five years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States and ten years in the EU. There is no comparable pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.

Available Information 
We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All of our filings with the SEC (including documents that we “furnish” with the SEC rather than “file” with the SEC) are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Our filings with the SEC are also available free of charge on our website at www.kindredbio.com as soon as reasonably practicable after each document is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained in, or accessible through, our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference into any other filings that we make with the SEC.
