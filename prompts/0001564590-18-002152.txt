--------+---------

Overview
 We are a global biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene expression. We are harnessing the RNAi pathway to develop a potential new class of innovative medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics. RNAi therapeutics are comprised of small interfering RNA, or siRNA, and function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
 Our research and development strategy is to target genetically validated liver-expressed genes that have been implicated in the cause or pathway of human disease. We utilize a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, or N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNAc, conjugate approach to enable hepatic delivery of siRNAs. Our focus is on clinical indications where there is a high unmet need, early biomarkers for the assessment of clinical activity in Phase 1 clinical studies, and a definable path for drug development, regulatory approval, patient access and commercialization.
 Specifically, our broad pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in three Strategic Therapeutic Areas, or “STArs:” Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases. We are committed to the advancement of our Alnylam 2020 strategy, which is to achieve a company profile with three marketed products and ten RNAi therapeutic clinical programs, including four in late stages of development, across our three STArs by the end of 2020. In December 2017, we filed our first new drug application, or NDA, and marketing authorisation application, or MAA, for patisiran. In January 2018, we announced that the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has accepted the MAA and initiated its review. Patisiran was previously granted an accelerated assessment by the EMA.  In early February 2018, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has accepted our NDA and granted our request for priority review, with an action date of August 11, 2018. If approved, we expect to launch patisiran and begin generating product revenues in 2018.
 Finally, based on our expertise in RNAi therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate, we have formed alliances with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to support our development and commercialization efforts, including Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, The Medicines Company, or MDCO, and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.

Recent Developments 
 Sanofi Genzyme Restructuring
 On January 6, 2018, we and Sanofi Genzyme entered into an amendment to our 2014 collaboration, which is structured as an exclusive relationship for the worldwide development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics in the field of Genetic Medicines. In connection and simultaneously with entering into the 2018 amendment to the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, we and Sanofi Genzyme also entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with respect to all TTR products, including patisiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and any back-up products, referred to as the Exclusive TTR License, and the ALN-AT3 Global License Terms with respect to fitusiran and any back-up products, referred to as the AT3 License Terms.  
 Under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, Sanofi Genzyme has certain rights to our current and future Genetic Medicine programs that reach human proof-of-principal study completion, or Human POP, by the end of 2019, subject to extension to the end of 2021 in various circumstances.  Under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, we were leading development and commercialization of patisiran in the United States, Canada and Western Europe (Alnylam Territory), while Sanofi Genzyme had rights to develop and commercialize the product in the rest of the world (Sanofi Genzyme Territory). Sanofi Genzyme also had a right to opt in to co-develop and co-promote ALN-TTRsc02 in the Alnylam Territory along with its regional opt-in rights.  In addition, Sanofi Genzyme had opted in to co-develop and co-promote fitusiran in the Alnylam Territory, as well as develop and commercialize fitusiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory.
 The 2018 amendment, together with the Exclusive TTR License and the AT3 License Terms, revise the terms and conditions of the 2014 collaboration to (i) provide us with the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of all TTR products, including patisiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and any back-up products, (ii) provide Sanofi Genzyme the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of fitusiran and any back-up products and (iii) terminate the previous co-development and co-commercialization rights related to revusiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and fitusiran under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration. 
 Sanofi Genzyme continues to have the right to opt into our other rare genetic disease programs for development and commercialization in territories outside of the Alnylam Territory as contemplated in the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as well as one right to a global license.
 The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and clearances, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.  We expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of 2018.
 The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, as well as the Exclusive TTR License and the AT3 License Terms, are described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”

UK Biobank Consortium
 In December 2017, we entered into a 'pre-competitive' consortium together with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Biogen Inc. and Pfizer Inc., to fund the generation of exome sequence data from the 500,000 volunteer participants who make up the UK Biobank health resource by the end of 2019. We and each of the other collaborators agreed to commit $10.0 million to enable an acceleration of sequencing timelines.  Regeneron will conduct the sequencing effort and the data will be paired with detailed, de-identified medical and health records within the UK Biobank resource, to create a comprehensive resource for linking human genetic variations to human biology and disease.  All consortium members will have a limited period of exclusive access to the sequencing data, before the data will be made available to other health researchers by UK Biobank. Consortium members have committed to make all significant research findings public. We believe that the broad and ongoing access to detailed health and full exome sequencing data for the 500,000 UK Biobank participants will greatly enhance our target identification and validation efforts, contributing to the sustainability of our RNAi therapeutics product engine.
RNAi Therapeutics – A Potential New Class of Innovative Medicines
 RNAi is a natural cellular process that was discovered in 1998 and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine to Dr. Andrew Fire and Dr. Craig Mello.
 RNAi therapeutics harness the natural RNAi pathway to silence disease-associated genes and knock down production of disease-causing proteins, representing the opportunity to create a potential new class of innovative medicines. RNAi therapeutics exert their biological effects through a highly potent, catalytic mechanism.  This unique mechanism of action confers a number of attributes that we believe have the potential to provide meaningful differentiation and distinct value for our investigational RNAi therapeutics relative to other drug classes.
 
 
 | Key Features of Alnylam Investigational RNAi Therapeutics Potential Attributes for Differentiation and Value 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Potential to silence any disease-associated gene, including so-called “undruggable” targets, where conventional therapeutic modalities (e.g., small molecule drugs and biologics) have not been successful
• | Demonstrated potential in clinical trials to achieve robust clinical activity with up to 99 percent target gene knockdown in some cases 
• | Clamped pharmacodynamic effect that has potential to provide improved and consistent efficacy compared with intermittent and transient effects often achieved with other drug classes 
• | Demonstrated durability of effect in clinical trials that enables once-monthly, once-quarterly and, in some cases, possible bi-annual dose regimens 
• | Ability to be administered via subcutaneous injection when using our proprietary GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform 
• | Potential for room temperature stability, avoiding the inconveniences, costs and global challenges of a cold chain distribution 

 We believe that the combination of these attributes represents a very promising profile for our investigational therapeutics, even in competitive markets, and in December 2017, we filed the first ever regulatory applications with the FDA and the EMA for approval of an RNAi therapeutic.  We have reported on our advances in developing RNAi therapeutics as potential drugs in a large number of peer-reviewed publications and many scientific meetings, including publications by Alnylam scientists in the journals Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet.

Our Product Platform
 We believe that we have created a reproducible and modular platform for drug discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines.
 
 
Alnylam Reproducible and Modular Platform Strategic Framework for Innovative Medicines
1 | Genetically validated, liver-expressed target gene | • High unmet need population • Opportunity for highly competitive profile • Delivery with GalNAc-conjugate platform 
2 | Biomarker for human proof-of-concept in Phase 1 | • Blood- or urine-based • Informative disease correlation • Establish dose/regimen for late stage development 
3 | Definable path to potential approval and market | • Clinical development plans with established endpoints • Demonstrable value for payors 

 Delivery of RNAi Therapeutics
 In recent years, a tremendous amount of progress has been made in effectively delivering RNAi therapeutics to targeted organs and cells, and we believe Alnylam has been the leader of this advancement. This delivery success is now enabling execution on our Alnylam 2020 strategy.
 Early efforts focused on delivery of RNAi therapeutics utilizing LNPs, where siRNA molecules are encapsulated in specific lipid-based formulations. This technology enables systemic delivery with intravenous drug administration. Results with LNP-based investigational RNAi therapeutics demonstrated potent, rapid and durable target gene silencing in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Further, LNP-based investigational RNAi therapeutics have been found to be generally well tolerated in clinical studies conducted to date.  Our lead product, patisiran, is formulated utilizing LNPs.
 More recently, we began advancing proprietary technology that conjugates a sugar molecule called GalNAc to the siRNA molecule. This simpler delivery approach enables more convenient, subcutaneous administration of our drug candidates, a key aspect of our platform. Results from our Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform demonstrated a substantial increase in potency over our earlier standard template chemistry (STC)-GalNAc-conjugate approach in pre-clinical and clinical studies, and a durability of effect that we believe, based on our clinical results, supports once-monthly, once-quarterly, and in some cases, possibly even bi-annual subcutaneous dose regimens. Due to this increased potency and durability, as well as a wide therapeutic index, this conjugate platform has become our primary approach for development of investigational RNAi therapeutics.  During 2017, we continued to invest in the enhancement of this platform and reported pre-clinical results from our ESC Plus (ESC+) GalNAc-conjugates. ESC+ GalNAc-conjugates utilize advanced design features to further improve specificity, including a glycol nucleic acid, or GNA, modification in the antisense seed region of the siRNA, while maintaining potency and durability, further improving our already wide therapeutic index by six-fold.  The ESC+ design is now being applied to all of our pre-clinical programs and has shown successful translation of potency from rodents to non-human primates. We intend to employ our ESC+ GalNAc-conjugate platform in future development programs.
 We have extensive human safety experience with our investigational RNAi therapeutics. Our data demonstrate that to date, RNAi therapeutics have been generally well tolerated with minimal platform-related safety findings. Based on data as of December 2016, in over 1,000 patients or volunteers dosed for over three years in more than ten clinical programs, the safety findings, set forth below, occur at a low incidence and are monitorable. They are also generally asymptomatic and reversible even with continued dosing.  As noted, as of December 2016, these findings include:  
  
• | Low incidence (2.2 percent) of generally mild, asymptomatic, reversible liver function test increases greater than three times the upper limit of normal
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low incidence (15.2 percent) of generally mild, transient injection site reactions, or ISRs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our view, this is an acceptable tolerability profile in the high unmet need indications that we pursue. Continued review of data across our programs since December 2016 has not led to any meaningful change in human safety with respect to our RNAi platform.

In October 2016, we observed an apparent imbalance in mortality in the treatment arm of the ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 study for revusiran, our first generation, subcutaneously administered, investigational therapeutic for the treatment of cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis, which utilized our STC-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform. With patient safety at the forefront, the ENDEAVOUR study was discontinued and a comprehensive investigation into the causality of this imbalance was conducted.
 The investigation revealed no overall baseline imbalance, although there was a greater number of older patients randomized to the revusiran arm. There was no clinical evidence for revusiran-mediated cardiotoxicity or findings that would suggest that the mortality imbalance was the result of revusiran pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects. While our investigation could not fully exclude a possible drug-related cause, there was some evidence for imbalance due to a lower-than-expected mortality rate in the placebo arm at the time of study discontinuation.
 Due to lack of evidence of any broader platform issue, the decision to discontinue development of revusiran did not affect patisiran, which utilizes our LNP delivery platform, or any of our other investigational RNAi therapeutic programs in development, which utilize our ESC-GalNAc-conjugate or ESC+ GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform.
 We believe RNAi therapeutics represent a simplified and efficient potential new class of innovative medicines. We have achieved human proof of concept in multiple clinical trials of our investigational candidates, providing strong support for our approach to drug development.  Moreover, we believe that our reproducible and modular platform will support the achievement of our 2020 goals, such that by the end of 2020, we can grow into a multi-product commercial stage company with a deep and sustainable pipeline that can fuel continued growth for the future.
 Our Product Pipeline
 Our broad pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in three STArs: Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases. The chart below is a summary of our product development programs as of January 31, 2018. It identifies those programs in which we have achieved human proof-of-concept, or POC, by demonstrating target gene knockdown and/or additional evidence of activity in clinical studies, those programs for which we have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, the development stage of our programs, and our commercial rights to such programs:

We have spent substantial funds over the past three years to develop our product pipeline and expect to continue to do so in the future. We incurred research and development expenses of $390.6 million in 2017, $382.4 million in 2016 and $276.5 million in 2015.
 The investigational therapeutics described below are in various stages of clinical development and the scientific information included about these therapeutics is preliminary and investigative. None of our investigational therapeutics have been approved by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or efficacy of these investigational therapeutics.
 Late Stage Clinical Development Programs
 Patisiran —  Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis 
 Patisiran, our most advanced investigational RNAi therapeutic, is currently under priority regulatory review in the United States and accelerated assessment in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis. If approved, we expect to make patisiran commercially available to patients in the United States in mid-2018 and in the EU in late 2018.  We also plan to file for regulatory approval in Japan in mid-2018 and in one or more additional countries by the end of the year.
 hATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating and often fatal disease affecting approximately 50,000 patients worldwide. It is caused by deposition of wild-type and mutant transthyretin, or TTR, in peripheral tissues, such as the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Thus, polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy are two cardinal manifestations of this disease, with most patients exhibiting a spectrum of both. TTR protein is produced primarily in the liver and is normally a carrier of vitamin A. Patisiran targets wild-type and all known mutant forms of TTR, including the V30M and V122I, the most common disease-causing mutations, and therefore it represents a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis.
 hATTR amyloidosis is a progressive disease, with an overall survival of two to 15 years from symptom onset, but only two to five years in patients presenting with cardiomyopathy. Orthotopic liver transplant, or OLT, and TTR tetramer stabilizers, such as tafamidis (approved in Europe, Japan and certain countries in Latin America, specific indication varies by region), are the only approved treatment options. However, availability is limited and most patients continue to experience significant morbidity and mortality associated with disease progression.  Palliative therapies directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been the mainstay of treatment despite their limited effectiveness. Other investigational drugs in development for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis include the TTR-targeting antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, inotersen, which showed statistically significant slowing of neuropathy progression and improvement in quality of life relative to placebo in a randomized Phase 3 trial and is currently under regulatory review in the United States and the EU, and a fibril-disrupting drug combination of doxycycline and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, which to date has only been tested in small single-arm Phase 2 studies. Thus, there remains a high unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy that can benefit the broad hATTR amyloidosis population.
 APOLLO Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 Trial Design: Initiated in November 2013 and completed in September 2017, APOLLO is the largest pivotal study conducted to date in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy, with 225 patients enrolled, representing 39 TTR genotypes from across 19 countries. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in the modified neuropathy impairment score, or mNIS+7, at 18 months. The mNIS+7 score is an evaluation of muscle weakness, sensory and autonomic function, and nerve conductance across a 304-point scale, where neuropathy progression leads to an increased score over time. A key secondary endpoint was the Norfolk Quality of Life Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QOL-DN, questionnaire, which is a validated instrument that measures clinical benefit. Additional secondary endpoints included: NIS-weakness, the subdomain of mNIS+7 assessing muscle strength; Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale, or R-ODS, a patient reported outcome measure of activities of daily living and disability; timed 10-meter walk test, assessing ambulatory ability and gait speed; modified body mass index, or mBMI, assessing nutritional status; and COMPASS-31, a patient questionnaire assessing autonomic disease symptoms. Exploratory endpoints measured the effects on cardiac structure and function. Patients were randomized 2:1, patisiran-to-placebo, with patisiran administered at 0.30 mg/kg once every three weeks for 18 months by intravenous infusion. 99 percent of patients who completed the APOLLO study rolled over into the Phase 3 OLE study, called the Global OLE.

Trial Results:
 Efficacy: Patisiran met the primary endpoint of mNIS+7 change from baseline at 18 months relative to placebo, and all secondary study endpoints. Specifically:
  
• | Patisiran treatment (N=148) resulted in a negative 6.0-point mean change (improvement) in mNIS+7 score from baseline at 18 months as compared to a 28.0-point mean increase (worsening) reported for the placebo group (N=77), resulting in a 34.0-point mean difference relative to placebo (p=9.26 x 10-24).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Improvement in mNIS+7 from patisiran treatment was also consistently observed across all defined patient subgroups, including age, sex, race, geographic region, baseline neuropathy impairment, genotype, prior TTR stabilizer use, baseline Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy, or FAP, stage, and inclusion in the pre-specified cardiac subpopulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patisiran treatment resulted in a negative 6.7-point mean change (improvement) in Norfolk QoL-DN score from baseline at 18 months as compared to a 14.4-point mean increase (worsening) reported for the placebo group, resulting in a 21.1-point mean difference relative to placebo (p=1.10 x 10-10).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a pre-specified binary analysis of neurological improvement, 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval, or CI: 48.1, 64.1) of patisiran patients had an improvement in mNIS+7 (less than 0-point change compared to baseline at 18 months), while 4 percent (95 percent CI: 0.0, 8.2) of placebo patients had an improvement (p=1.82 x 10-15).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Similarly, 51 percent (95 percent CI: 43.3, 59.4) of patisiran patients had an improvement in Norfolk QoL-DN (less than 0-point change compared to baseline at 18 months), versus 10 percent (95 percent CI: 3.6, 17.2) for placebo (p=1.95 x 10-10).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patisiran also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in all other secondary endpoints at 18 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cardiac Subpopulation Results: Favorable and significant changes in several exploratory cardiac measures, including N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, or NT-proBNP, and certain echocardiographic parameters, were reported in patisiran-treated patients with pre-defined cardiac involvement (baseline left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm with no history of hypertension or aortic valve disease). Specifically:

• | Patisiran treatment resulted in a median decrease (improvement) of 49.9 pg/ml in NT-proBNP levels as compared to a median increase (worsening) of 320 pg/ml reported for the placebo arm at 18 months (nominal p=7.74 x 10-8, based on analysis of log-transformed values).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regarding echocardiographic measures, patisiran treatment resulted in a mean 0.93 mm reduction (improvement) in left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (nominal p=0.0173) and a mean absolute 1.37 percent improvement in longitudinal strain (nominal p=0.0154) relative to placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety and Tolerability: Patisiran showed an encouraging safety and tolerability profile relative to placebo with up to 18 months of dosing. Specifically:
 
 
• | The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, that occurred more frequently in patisiran patients were peripheral edema (29.7 percent versus 22.1 percent in placebo) and infusion-related reactions, or IRRs (18.9 percent versus 9.1 percent in placebo). These were generally mild to moderate in severity and only one patient discontinued due to an IRR (0.7 percent).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compared to placebo, patisiran treatment was associated with fewer treatment discontinuations (4.7 versus 14.3 percent) and fewer study withdrawals (4.7 versus 11.7 percent) due to AEs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The incidence of serious adverse events, or SAEs, across the patisiran (36.5 percent) and placebo (40.3 percent) groups was similar.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SAEs reported in 2 or more patients in the patisiran group included: diarrhea (5.4 percent), cardiac failure, congestive cardiac failure, orthostatic hypotension, pneumonia, and atrioventricular block complete (2 percent each). These were all considered unrelated to patisiran, except for one SAE of diarrhea. SAEs occurred with similar frequency in the placebo group, except for diarrhea (1.3 percent in placebo group).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deaths were recorded with a similar incidence across the patisiran (4.7 percent) and placebo (7.8 percent) treatment groups.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | No deaths were considered related to study drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | There were no safety signals with regard to hepatic or renal function, or evidence of thrombocytopenia, due to patisiran.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Designations
 
Patisiran has been granted the following regulatory designations:
 
 
• | Orphan Medicinal Product Designation (EMA)
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Orphan Drug Designation (FDA)
--+------------------------------


• | Fast Track Designation (FDA)
--+-----------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) Designation (UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA))
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of the 2018 amendment to the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration and the Exclusive TTR License, following the closing of the transaction, we will have global rights for the development and commercialization of patisiran, together with ALN-TTRsc02, discussed below, and all back-up products. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, as well as the Exclusive TTR License, are described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Givosiran — Acute Hepatic Porphyrias 
 Givosiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinate synthase-1, or ALAS1, for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias, or AHPs. It is designed to target and silence the ALAS1 mRNA, blocking the production of ALAS1 protein, the liver-expressed rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Lowering of ALAS1 may reduce the accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates, ALA and porphobilinogen, or PBG, that cause the clinical manifestations of AHPs, including acute debilitating neurovisceral attacks as well as chronic disabling disease symptoms. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 patients in the United States and Europe suffer sporadic AHP attacks annually, and approximately 1,000 patients are afflicted with recurrent, debilitating attacks.  There are no approved therapies for prevention of acute attacks. Intravenous, or IV, hemin is currently approved for the treatment of acute AHP attacks, and is sometimes used prophylactically off-label by some porphyria specialists to prevent attacks, despite its unclear efficacy, short duration of action and association with significant side effects. There is a clear unmet need for novel therapeutics with an enhanced efficacy and safety profile and durable lowering of ALA and PBG, in order to prevent attacks, diminish chronic symptoms in between attacks, and improve patients’ quality of life.
 Givosiran has the potential to be utilized for the chronic treatment of AHPs. In September 2017, we aligned with the FDA on a pivotal Phase 3 trial design that includes an interim analysis based on reduction of urinary ALA as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. This will enable a potential NDA filing at or around year-end 2018, pending FDA review of the program at the time of interim analysis and assuming positive results. The ENVISION Phase 3 pivotal study for givosiran was initiated in November 2017 and we expect to report interim analysis data in mid-2018.
 ENVISION Trial Design:
 The ENVISION Phase 3 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter study in more than 20 countries to evaluate the efficacy and safety of givosiran in approximately 75 patients with a documented diagnosis of AHPs. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 2.5 mg/kg of givosiran or placebo subcutaneously administered monthly, over a six-month treatment period. The primary endpoint is the annualized rate of porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit or IV hemin administration at home over the six-month treatment period. The planned interim analysis will evaluate reduction of a urinary biomarker, ALA, in 30 patients after three months of dosing, as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The interim analysis is also designed to conduct a blinded assessment of the porphyria attack rate for the purpose of a study sample size adjustment from approximately 75 patients to up to approximately 94 patients. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate reductions in the cardinal symptoms of AHPs, such as pain, nausea and fatigue, as well as impact on quality of life. All patients completing the six-month treatment period will be eligible to continue on an OLE study in which they will receive treatment with givosiran for up to 30 months.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial (Part C and OLE)
 During 2017, we reported interim data from Part C of our Phase 1 clinical trial of givosiran, which was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in up to 24 patients with acute intermittent porphyria, or AIP, the most common AHP sub-type, who experienced recurrent porphyria attacks, along with data from the Phase 1 OLE study of givosiran. 
 9


As of the data transfer date of April 21, 2017, givosiran achieved potent silencing of the ALAS1 mRNA, which resulted in robust and durable lowering of ALA and PBG. Data from the OLE study demonstrated that longer-term treatment with givosiran was associated with consistent reductions in the annualized porphyria attack rate, with preliminary evidence suggesting the potential for further reductions in the attack rate with extended dosing. As of the data cutoff date, givosiran administration was generally well tolerated in recurrent attack AIP patients in cohorts 1-3 in Part C of the Phase 1 study and in cohorts 1 and 2 of the ongoing OLE study, with a mean of 169 and 111 days on study, respectively, and up to 12 months on givosiran. As previously reported, one death occurred in a patient in cohort 3 in the givosiran arm due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis complicated by a pulmonary embolism and following a recent hospitalization for bacteremia; the death was considered to be unlikely related to study drug by the investigator and the study's Safety Review Committee. 
 Regulatory Designations
 Givosiran has been granted the following regulatory designations for the treatment of AHPs:
  
• | Orphan Drug Designation (FDA)
--+------------------------------


• | Orphan Medicinal Product Designation (EMA)
--+-------------------------------------------


• | PRIME Designation (EMA)
--+------------------------


• | Breakthrough Therapy Designation (FDA)
--+---------------------------------------

 During 2016, Sanofi Genzyme elected not to opt into the development and commercialization of givosiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory, providing us with full global control of the program for further development and commercialization, if approved. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Fitusiran — Hemophilia and Rare Bleeding Disorders
 Fitusiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin, or AT, for the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors.  Fitusiran also has the potential to be used for rare bleeding disorders, or RBD. Fitusiran is designed to lower levels of AT with the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to prevent bleeding. AT acts by inactivating thrombin and other coagulation factors, and plays a key role in normal hemostasis by helping to limit the process of fibrin clot formation. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by an underlying defect in the ability to generate adequate levels of thrombin needed for effective fibrin clot formation, thereby resulting in recurrent bleeds into joints, muscles, and major internal organs. Lowering AT in the hemophilia setting may promote the generation of sufficient levels of thrombin needed to form an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding. This rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that co-inheritance of thrombophilic mutations, including AT deficiency, may ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia. We believe this approach is a unique and innovative strategy for preventing bleeding in people with hemophilia.
 There are approximately 200,000 people living with hemophilia A and hemophilia B worldwide. Standard treatment for people with hemophilia currently involves replacement of the deficient clotting factor either as prophylaxis or on-demand therapy, which can lead to a temporary restoration of thrombin generation capacity. However, with current factor replacement treatments people with hemophilia are at risk of developing neutralizing antibodies, or inhibitors, to their replacement factor, a very serious complication affecting as many as one third of people with severe hemophilia A and a smaller fraction of people with hemophilia B. People who develop inhibitors become refractory to replacement factor therapy and are twice as likely to be hospitalized for a bleeding episode. 
 
During 2017, we initiated the ATLAS Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in people with hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors. Fitusiran is also currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 OLE study.  In September 2017, we reported a fatal thrombotic event in a patient with hemophilia A without inhibitors in the Phase 2 OLE study of fitusiran.  As a result, we elected to suspend dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies pending review of the safety event and development of a risk mitigation strategy.  In early November 2017, we and the FDA reached alignment on clinical risk mitigation measures, including protocol-specified guidelines and additional investigator and patient education concerning reduced doses of replacement factor or bypassing agent to treat any breakthrough bleeds in fitusiran studies. Based on this, amended protocols were submitted to the regulatory authorities and in December 2017, the FDA lifted the clinical hold.  Dosing has resumed in the Phase 2 OLE study and we expect to begin dosing patients in the ATLAS Phase 3 program in early 2018.

ATLAS Phase 3 Clinical Program 
 
Trial Design: ATLAS is a global, multicenter program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in three separate trials, including patients with hemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors.

• | ATLAS-INH, a nine-month, open-label, randomized, controlled trial designed to enroll approximately 50 patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors receiving prior on-demand therapy with bypassing agents. The study's primary endpoint is the annualized bleeding rate, or ABR, and secondary endpoints include the annualized spontaneous bleeding rate, annualized joint bleeding rate, and quality of life as measured by the Haem-A-QOL score.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ATLAS-A/B, a nine-month, open-label, randomized, controlled trial designed to enroll approximately 120 patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors receiving prior on-demand therapy with factor. The study's primary endpoint is the ABR, and secondary endpoints include the annualized spontaneous bleeding rate, annualized joint bleeding rate, and quality of life as measured by the Haem-A-QOL score.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ATLAS-PPX, an open-label, one-way crossover study designed to enroll approximately 30 patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors receiving prior prophylaxis therapy with bypassing agents. In this study, patients will receive standard of care bypassing agent prophylaxis therapy for six months and then transition to fitusiran treatment for seven months. The ABR will be prospectively measured in both periods. The study's primary endpoint is the ABR in the fitusiran period and in the bypassing agent prophylaxis period. Secondary endpoints include the annualized spontaneous bleeding rate, annualized joint bleeding rate, and quality of life as measured by the Haem-A-QOL score.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2 OLE Clinical Study
 In July 2017, we reported interim results from the ongoing fitusiran Phase 2 OLE study which includes patients with hemophilia A and B, and includes 14 patients with inhibitors, including one with hemophilia B. As of a June 15, 2017 data transfer date, once-monthly subcutaneous administration of fitusiran achieved lowering of AT, increases in thrombin generation, and, in a post-hoc exploratory analysis, reductions in the median estimated ABR in patients with and without inhibitors. With respect to safety, three SAEs were considered possibly related to study drug, including one fatal cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, as noted above, that occurred after the data cutoff date.  The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Regulatory Designations
 Fitusiran has been granted the following regulatory designations for the treatment of hemophilia A and B:
  
• | Orphan Drug Designation (FDA)
--+------------------------------


• | Orphan Medicinal Product Designation (EMA)
--+-------------------------------------------

 
As a result of the January 2018 amendment to the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration and the AT3 License Terms, following the closing of the transaction, Sanofi Genzyme will have global rights to develop and commercialize fitusiran.  We expect to substantially complete the transition of the fitusiran program to Sanofi Genzyme by mid-2018.  The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, as well as the AT3 License Terms, are described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Inclisiran — Hypercholesterolemia
 Inclisiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a protein involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor, or LDL receptor, levels on hepatocytes and the metabolism of LDL cholesterol, or LDL-C, which is commonly referred to as “bad” cholesterol. PCSK9 is produced by the liver and circulates in the bloodstream. Both intracellular and extracellular PCSK9 reduce the liver’s capacity to absorb LDL-C by decreasing LDL receptor levels. 
 Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is the leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually. Eighty percent of all CVD deaths are due to coronary heart disease, or CHD, or strokes. Elevated LDL-C is a major risk factor for the development of CVD and has recently been described as causative. Lowering LDL-C has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart attack, and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk reduction is linearly-proportional to absolute LDL-C reduction.
 11


Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies, predominantly statins, to reduce LDL-C and the associated risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke or associated events. However, residual risk for cardiovascular events remains and statins are associated with well-known limitations. First, not all subjects reach LDL-C levels associated with optimal protection against clinical events. Second, not all subjects tolerate statins or are able to take statins at sufficiently-intensive doses. Third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50 percent of patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than six months. Despite statins alone or in combination with other lipid lowering medications, current therapies for the management of elevated LDL-C remain insufficient in some subjects. This is particularly true in patients with pre-existing CHD and/or diabetes or a history of familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH, who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive management. There is an unmet need for additional treatment options beyond currently-available treatments for lowering of the LDL-C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.
 In February 2013, we and MDCO entered into a license and collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted to MDCO an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, MDCO assumed responsibility for the development and commercialization of inclisiran from Phase 2 forward. A description of our agreement with MDCO is included below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 In 2017, MDCO initiated the ORION Phase 3 program for inclisiran, a comprehensive set of clinical trials to assess LDL-C lowering and safety in a wide range of patients.  The Phase 3 program includes the four pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials described below and represents the largest clinical experience for an investigational RNAi therapeutic to date: 
  
• | ORION-11 – a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in patients (N=1,500) with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, or ASCVD-risk equivalents, and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies, including statins. This pivotal trial was initiated in November 2017. In January 2018, MDCO announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 1,500 patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ORION-10 – a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in ASCVD patients (N=1,500). This pivotal trial was initiated in November 2017 and MDCO expects to complete enrollment during the first half of 2018. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ORION-9 – a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in patients (N=400) with heterozygous FH. This pivotal trial was initiated in November 2017 and MDCO expects to complete enrollment during the first half of 2018. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ORION-5 – a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in patients (N=60) with homozygous FH, or HoFH. MDCO expects to initiate this pivotal trial in 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORION-1 Phase 2 Clinical Trial
During 2017, we and MDCO reported final results from ORION-1, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 study of inclisiran in patients (N=501) with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and FH) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies.  The Phase 2 study, conducted by MDCO, compared the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluated the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day-180. Inclisiran demonstrated significant and sustained reductions in LDL-C of over 50 percent. For all dose groups, at all time points, differences in the primary (LDL-C) and secondary (PCSK9) endpoints between inclisiran and placebo were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Inclisiran represents the largest safety experience for one of our investigational RNAi therapeutics to date.  Inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no significant elevations of liver enzymes considered related to study medication and no neuropathy, change in renal function, thrombocytopenia or anti-drug antibodies.  
 
The results from the Phase 2 study of inclisiran were published in April 2017 in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 Regulatory Designations
 Inclisiran has been granted the following regulatory designation for the treatment of HoFH:
  
• | Orphan Drug Designation (FDA)

Early Stage Clinical Development Programs
 ALN-TTRsc02 —  TTR-Mediated (ATTR) Amyloidosis
 ALN-TTRsc02 is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, representing an extension of our program for ATTR amyloidosis, discussed in more detail above under the heading “Patisiran.”  We believe ALN-TTRsc02 has the potential to offer an attractive option for patients as a once-quarterly, low-volume, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis.
 We are evaluating ALN-TTRsc02 in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and we expect to advance ALN-TTRsc02 into a Phase 3 clinical trial in late 2018.
 As a result of the 2018 amendment to the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration and the Exclusive TTR License, following the closing of the transaction, we will have global rights for the development and commercialization of patisiran, discussed above, together with ALN-TTRsc02 and all back-up products. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, as well as the Exclusive TTR License, are described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Lumasiran (ALN-GO1) — Primary Hyperoxaluria 1
 Lumasiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase, or GO, in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1.  PH1 is an autosomal recessive disorder of glyoxylate metabolism, resulting in excessive oxalate production. Excess oxalate in PH1 patients results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of recurrent kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. Lumasiran is designed to reduce the hepatic levels of the GO enzyme, thereby depleting the substrate necessary for oxalate production, which directly contributes to the pathophysiology of PH1. 
 We are evaluating lumasiran for the treatment of patients with PH1 in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial. 
 Sanofi Genzyme has the right to opt in to develop and commercialize lumasiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory and could elect to exercise its one right to a global license for lumasiran. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Cemdisiran (ALN-CC5) —  Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
Cemdisiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the complement pathway in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. The complement system plays a central role in immunity as a protective mechanism for host defense, but its dysregulation results in life-threatening complications in a broad range of human diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and aHUS, amongst others. Complement component C5, which is predominantly expressed in liver cells, is a genetically and clinically validated target; loss-of-function human mutations are associated with an attenuated immune response against certain infections and intravenous anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, or mAb, therapy has demonstrated clinical activity and tolerability in a number of complement-mediated diseases. A subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic that silences C5 represents a novel approach for the potential treatment of complement-mediated diseases. 
 
We are evaluating cemdisiran for the treatment of patients with aHUS in a Phase 2 clinical trial initiated in September 2017.
 
During 2016, Sanofi Genzyme elected not to opt into the development and commercialization of cemdisiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory, providing us with full global control of the program for further development and commercialization, if approved. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as amended in January 2018, is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 
Additional Early Stage and Pre-clinical Programs
 
In addition to the programs listed above, we are also advancing other earlier-stage clinical pipeline programs and expect multiple data read-outs throughout 2018. We also plan to file one or more new clinical trial applications, or CTAs, in 2018, and to advance our infectious disease collaboration with Vir Biotechnology.

Our Collaboration and Licensing Strategy
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutic products directed towards our three STArs: Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, collaboration and licensing agreements as a means of obtaining resources, capabilities and funding to advance our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
 Our collaboration strategy is to form alliances that create significant value for ourselves and our collaborators in the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a potential new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, with respect to our Genetic Medicine pipeline, we formed a broad strategic alliance with Sanofi Genzyme in 2014 pursuant to which we retain development and commercial rights for our current and future Genetic Medicine products in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, and Sanofi Genzyme will develop and commercialize our current and future Genetic Medicine products for which it elects to opt-in, in the rest of the world, subject to certain broader rights. In January 2018, we and Sanofi Genzyme amended our 2014 collaboration to provide that we would develop and commercialize patisiran globally and Sanofi Genzyme would develop and commercialize fitusiran globally. With respect to our Cardio-Metabolic pipeline, we intend to seek future strategic alliances for these programs, under which we may retain certain product development and commercialization rights, or we may structure as global alliances, as we did in our collaboration with MDCO to advance inclisiran. With respect to our Hepatic Infectious Disease pipeline, in October 2017, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Vir Biotechnology for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
 We also have entered into license agreements to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of RNAi. In addition, because delivery of RNAi therapeutics has historically been an important objective of our research activities, we have entered into various collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies, including various LNP delivery technologies. 
 Strategic Alliances
 We have formed, and intend to continue to form, strategic alliances to gain access to the financial, technical, clinical and commercial resources necessary to develop and market RNAi therapeutics. We expect these alliances to provide us with financial support in the form of upfront cash payments, license fees, equity investments, research, development, and sales and marketing funding, milestone payments and/or royalties or profit sharing based on sales of RNAi therapeutics. Below is a brief description of our key strategic alliance and license agreements. 
Product Alliances.
 Sanofi Genzyme.    In January 2014, we entered into a global, strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics as Genetic Medicines to treat orphan diseases.  On January 6, 2018, we and Sanofi Genzyme entered into an amendment to the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, which is structured as an exclusive relationship for the worldwide development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics in the field of Genetic Medicines. In connection and simultaneously with entering into the 2018 amendment to the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, we and Sanofi Genzyme also entered into the Exclusive TTR License with respect to all TTR products, including patisiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and any back-up products, and the AT3 License Terms with respect to fitusiran and any back-up products.  
 Under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, Sanofi Genzyme has certain rights to our current and future Genetic Medicine programs that reach Human POP by the end of 2019, subject to extension to the end of 2021 in various circumstances.  Under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, we were leading development and commercialization of patisiran in the Alnylam Territory, while Sanofi Genzyme had rights to develop and commercialize the product in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory. Sanofi Genzyme also had a right to opt in to co-develop and co-promote ALN-TTRsc02 in the Alnylam Territory along with its regional opt-in rights.  In addition, Sanofi Genzyme had opted in to co-develop and co-promote fitusiran in the Alnylam Territory, as well as develop and commercialize fitusiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory.
 The 2018 amendment, together with the Exclusive TTR License and the AT3 License Terms, revise the terms and conditions of the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration to (i) provide us with the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of all TTR products, including patisiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and any back-up products, (ii) provide Sanofi Genzyme the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of fitusiran and any back-up products and (iii) terminate the previous co-development and co-commercialization rights related to revusiran, ALN-TTRsc02 and fitusiran under the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration. 
 14


Sanofi Genzyme continues to have the right to opt into our other rare genetic disease programs for development and commercialization in territories outside of the Alnylam Territory as contemplated in the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, as well as one right to a global license.
 The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and clearances, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.  We expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of 2018.

For more information regarding the Takeda agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Other Strategic License Agreements.
 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).    In January 2015, we and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, entered into a second amended and restated strategic collaboration and license agreement, which we further amended in July 2015. The 2015 Ionis agreement provides for certain new exclusive target cross-licenses of intellectual property on eight disease targets, providing each company with exclusive RNA therapeutic license rights for four programs, and extends the parties’ existing non-exclusive technology cross-license, which was originally entered into in 2004 and was amended and restated in 2009, through April 2019.  Under the original agreement, Ionis licensed to us its patent estate related to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi products.  In turn, we non-exclusively licensed to Ionis our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, single stranded RNAi therapeutics and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. Ionis also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi drugs targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a non-exclusive basis. For more information regarding the 2015 Ionis agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Intellectual Property Licenses
 In December 2002, we entered into a co-exclusive license with Max Planck Innovation GmbH (formerly known as Garching Innovation GmbH), or Max Planck Innovation, for the worldwide rights to use and sublicense certain patented technology to develop and commercialize therapeutic products and related applications. We also obtained the rights to use, without the right to sublicense, the technology for all diagnostic uses other than for the purposes of therapeutic monitoring. We were also given the right to acquire the remaining 50 percent exclusive rights, which right we exercised upon our acquisition of Ribopharma AG in July 2003. In June 2005, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Max Planck Innovation that secured our exclusivity to use and sublicense certain patented technology to develop and commercialize therapeutic products and related applications.
 We are not obligated to pay any development or sales milestone payments to Max Planck Innovation, however, we will be required to pay Max Planck Innovation future single-digit royalties on net sales of all therapeutic and prophylactic products developed with the technology, if any.
 Our agreements with Max Planck Innovation generally remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed thereunder. We estimate that the principal issued patents covered under the Max Planck Innovation agreements will expire both in and outside the United States during 2021, subject to any potential patent term extensions, restoration and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. We may terminate the agreements without cause with six months’ prior notice to Max Planck Innovation, and Max Planck Innovation may terminate the agreements in the event that we materially breach our obligations thereunder. Max Planck Innovation also has the right to terminate the agreements in the event that we, independently or through a third party, attack the validity of any of the licensed patents.
 Delivery-Related License Agreements
 Arbutus.    In November 2012, we, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, or ABC (formerly Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and Protiva Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Protiva, a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC, and together with ABC, referred to as Arbutus, agreed to restructure our existing contractual relationship. In connection with this restructuring, the parties entered into a cross-license agreement that superseded the prior license and manufacturing agreements among us.
 Under the 2012 cross-license agreement, the parties consolidated certain intellectual property related to LNP technology for the systemic delivery of RNAi therapeutics. Specifically, certain patents and patent applications, including the MC3 lipid family used with patisiran, were assigned by us to ABC. We retain rights to use this intellectual property for the research, development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutic products, including the rights to sublicense this intellectual property on a product-by-product basis. Arbutus has also granted us a worldwide license to its LNP technology for the research, development and commercialization of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics, which license shall be exclusive for up to eight targets designated by us, and otherwise shall be non-exclusive. We have the right to sublicense on a product-by-product basis.
 In addition, we elected to buy out our manufacturing obligations to ABC with respect to our LNP-based pipeline programs. We made a one-time payment of $30.0 million to ABC for the termination of, and our release from, all of our obligations under the manufacturing agreement. We also have the right to manufacture and have manufactured our LNP-based RNAi therapeutics, which right may be sublicensed to our collaborators.
 Further, pursuant to the 2012 cross-license agreement, we made a one-time payment of $35.0 million to ABC, which amount included a license termination payment, as well as the buy-down of certain milestone payments and the significant reduction of royalty rates for certain LNP-based products, including patisiran. In addition, we agreed to pay ABC an aggregate of $10.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to advancement of ALN-VSP and patisiran, representing the only remaining milestone obligations for these products. In December 2013, we paid to ABC $5.0 million in connection with the initiation of our APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial for patisiran, fulfilling one of these milestone obligations. With respect to the second $5.0 million milestone, in August 2013, we initiated binding arbitration proceedings to resolve a disagreement with ABC regarding the achievement by ABC of this milestone under our cross-license agreement relating to the manufacture of ALN-VSP clinical trial material for use in China. We prevailed in the arbitration proceedings in March 2016 and were not required to pay the second milestone at that time.
 Under the 2012 cross-license agreement, Arbutus has one exclusive and five non-exclusive licenses to research, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics directed to up to six gene targets.  As of November 12, 2017, Arbutus’ right to select up to two additional exclusive targets and up to five additional non-exclusive targets expired. Arbutus may sublicense its rights on a product-by-product basis. We are eligible to receive from Arbutus up to an aggregate of $8.5 million in milestone payments for RNAi therapeutics directed to each of four of the targets for which we have granted licenses to Arbutus, together with single-digit royalties on annual product sales, if any, of RNAi therapeutic products directed to all six of the targets for which we have granted licenses to Arbutus. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from Arbutus.
 16


The term of the 2012 cross-license agreement generally ends upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the first commercial sale of a product in a country and continuing during any period in which (a) in the case of us, a valid claim within the Arbutus Royalty-Bearing Patents (as defined in the 2012 cross-license agreement) covers our applicable product in such country of sale, or (b) in the case of Arbutus products, a valid claim within our patents covers the applicable Arbutus product in such country of sale. We estimate that our fundamental RNAi patents covered under the 2012 cross-license agreement will expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2019 and 2021, and that the Arbutus LNP patents covered under the 2012 cross-license agreement will expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2020 and 2030, subject in each case to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. Either party may terminate a license it granted to the other in the event that the other party fails to cure a material breach of its obligations relating to that license. Furthermore, either party may terminate the 2012 cross-license agreement in the event the other party fails to cure a material breach of an obligation under the agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the 2012 cross-license agreement upon patent-related challenges by the other party.
 UBC and Acuitas.    In July 2009, we entered into a research agreement with The University of British Columbia, or UBC, and Acuitas Therapeutics Inc., or Acuitas (formerly AlCana Technologies, Inc.), that was focused on the discovery of novel lipids, such as the MC3 lipid, which is employed in patisiran. Pursuant to the terms of the research agreement, we funded collaborative research through July 2012, which was conducted by our scientists, together with scientists at UBC and Acuitas. Under the research agreement, UBC and Acuitas are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $1.3 million in milestone payments from us for each licensed product (as defined in the research agreement) directed to a particular target (as defined in the research agreement), together with single-digit royalty payments on annual product sales, if any.
 Concurrent with the execution of the research agreement, we also entered into a supplemental agreement with ABC, Protiva, UBC and Acuitas, which contains additional terms regarding the intellectual property rights arising out of the research agreement. In connection with 2012 cross-license agreement with Arbutus described above, we and Arbutus agreed to supersede the rights and obligations under the supplemental agreement as between ourselves, with the rights and obligations set forth in the 2012 cross-license agreement.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We have devoted considerable effort and resources to establish what we believe to be a strong intellectual property position relevant to RNAi therapeutic products and delivery technologies. In this regard, we have amassed a portfolio of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property covering:

• | fundamental aspects of the structure and uses of siRNAs, including their use as therapeutics, and RNAi-related mechanisms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | chemical modifications to siRNAs that improve their suitability for therapeutic and other uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | siRNAs directed to specific targets as treatments for particular diseases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delivery technologies, such as in the fields of carbohydrate conjugates and cationic liposomes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all aspects of our specific development candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such broad and exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Our intellectual property estate for RNAi therapeutics includes over 3,800 active cases and over 1,700 granted or issued patents, of which over 600 are issued or granted in the United States, the EU, including by the European Patent Office, or EPO, and Japan. Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area.
 Intellectual Property Related to Fundamental Aspects and Uses of siRNA and RNAi-related Mechanisms
 In this category, we include United States and certain foreign patents and patent applications that claim key aspects of siRNA architecture and RNAi-related mechanisms. Specifically included are patents and patent applications covering targeted cleavage of mRNA directed by RNA-like oligonucleotides and double-stranded RNAs of particular lengths and particular structural features, such as blunt and/or overhanging ends, as well as various types and patterns of chemical modifications. Our strategy has been to secure exclusive rights where possible and appropriate to key patents and patent applications that we believe cover fundamental aspects of RNAi.

 We believe that we have a strong portfolio of broad rights to fundamental RNAi patents and patent applications. Many of these rights are exclusive, which we believe prevents potential competitors from commercializing products in the field of RNAi without taking a license from us. In securing these rights, we have focused on obtaining the strongest rights for those intellectual property assets we believe will be most important in providing competitive advantage with respect to RNAi therapeutic products.
 We believe that the Crooke patent series, issued in several countries around the world, covers the use of modified oligonucleotides to achieve enzyme-mediated cleavage of a target mRNA. We have obtained rights to the Crooke patents for use with double-stranded RNA products, through a license agreement with Ionis. Under the terms of our agreement, Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for double-stranded RNA products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role. Our agreement with Ionis was amended and restated in January 2015 to, among other things, extend the license for an additional five years, through April 2019.
 Through our acquisition of Ribopharma AG, now known as Alnylam Europe AG, we own the entire Kreutzer-Limmer patent portfolio, which includes pending applications in the United States and many countries worldwide.
 The Glover patent series has resulted in several patent grants, including in Europe (EP 1230375). We have an exclusive license to the Glover patent for therapeutic uses from Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRT.
 The Tuschl patent applications owned by Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or Whitehead, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, UMass and Max Planck Gesellschaft zur Foerderung der Wissenschaften e.V. on the invention by Dr. Tuschl and his colleagues, which we call the Tuschl I patent series, cover compositions and methods important for RNAi discovery. We are the exclusive licensee of the Tuschl I patent series for RNAi therapeutics. The Tuschl patent applications owned by Max Planck Gesellschaft zur Foerderung der Wissenschaften e.V., Whitehead, MIT and UMass on the invention by Dr. Tuschl and his colleagues, which we call the Tuschl II patent series, cover what we believe are key structural features of siRNAs. Specifically, the Tuschl II patents and patent applications include claims directed to synthetic siRNAs and the use of chemical modifications to stabilize siRNAs. We have obtained an exclusive license to claims in the Tuschl II patent series uniquely covering the use of RNAi for therapeutic purposes. Collectively, the Tuschl I and II patent families cover a wide range of double-stranded RNA molecules between 19-52 nucleotides in length, including those unmodified and those comprising chemical modifications. Examples of those chemical modifications encompassed by the Tuschl claims include those modifications made in the ribose ring, e.g., at the 2’ position such as 2’-OMe, 2’-F or modifications such as those found in locked and unlocked (acyclic) nucleotides.
 The Fire and Mello patent owned by the Carnegie Institution of Washington covers the use of double-stranded RNAs to induce RNAi. The Carnegie Institution has made this patent broadly available for licensing and we, like many companies, have taken a non-exclusive license to the patent for therapeutic purposes. We believe, however, that the claims of the Fire and Mello patent do not cover the structural features of double-stranded RNAs that are important for the biological activity of siRNAs in mammalian cells. We believe that these specific features are the subjects of the Crooke, Kreutzer-Limmer, Glover and Tuschl II patents and patent applications for which we have secured exclusive rights.
 The other pending patent applications listed in the table above either provide further coverage for structural features of siRNAs or relate to the use of siRNAs in mammalian cells. For some of these, we have exclusive rights, and for others, we have non-exclusive rights. In addition, in December 2008, we acquired the intellectual property assets of Nucleonics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company. This acquisition included over 100 active patent filings, including 15 patents that have been granted worldwide, of which five have been granted in the United States and Europe. With this acquisition, we obtained patents and patent applications with early priority dates, notably the “Li & Kirby,” “Pachuk I” and “Giordano” patent families, that cover broad structural features of RNAi therapeutics, thus extending the breadth of our fundamental intellectual property.
 21


Intellectual Property Related to Chemical Modifications
 Our amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Ionis provided us with rights to practice the inventions covered by over 200 issued patents worldwide, as well as rights based on future chemistry patent applications through April 2014 for use with double-stranded RNA products. In January 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated agreement with Ionis to extend our rights to future chemistry applications through April 2019. These patents expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2015 and 2035, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. These inventions cover chemical modifications we may wish to incorporate into double-stranded RNA therapeutic products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism. Under the terms of our agreement, Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for double-stranded RNA products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role.
 In addition to licensing these intellectual property rights from Ionis, we are also working to develop our own proprietary chemical modifications that may be incorporated into siRNAs to endow them with drug-like properties. We have filed a large number of patent applications relating to these novel and proprietary chemical modifications.
 With the combination of the technology we have licensed from Ionis, various patents in the Tuschl II patent series and our own patent application filings, we possess issued claims that cover methods of making siRNAs that incorporate any of various chemical modifications, including the use of phosphorothioates, 2’-O-methyl and/or 2’-fluoro modifications and modifications such as those found in locked and unlocked (acyclic) nucleotides. These modifications are believed to be important for achieving “drug-like” properties for RNAi therapeutics. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to these claims for RNAi therapeutics.
 In addition to the above, in March 2014, we acquired the RNAi assets from Merck, which included intellectual property developed at Sirna and Merck. The acquired patent portfolio includes the “McSwiggen” patent families with issued and pending claims covering highly chemically modified oligonucleotide compositions, both single- and double-stranded and independent of 5’ and 3’ architecture. Several patents have granted in the United States with claims directed to various combinations of chemical modifications to double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides. Notably, U.S. 8,273,866 was granted in September 2012 with significant patent term adjustment extending the expiration of this patent to mid-2028. EP423406 was granted in September 2010 with claims directed to double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides with ten or more chemical modifications on the pyrimidine residues of the sense and/or antisense strand. As indicated in the chart above, additional EP patents have granted with claims to various combinations of chemically modified compositions comprising double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides and methods of making and using such combinations. In November 2015, U.S. 9,181,551 granted with claims directed to highly modified double-stranded RNA molecules comprising a ligand, with dependent claims wherein the ligand is chosen from a ligand for a cellular receptor, a protein localization sequence, an antibody, a nucleic acid aptamer, a vitamin, a co-factor, a phospholipid, a cholesterol, a polyamine, a galactose, a galactosamine, a folate, an N-acetyl-galactosamine (wherein the N-acetylgalactosamine is a mono-antennary, bi-antennary or a tri-antennary galactosamine). Additional dependent claims are directed to highly modified double-stranded RNA with modified nucleotides, including but not limited to unlocked (acyclic) and locked nucleotides. In addition, in August 2017 the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, granted U.S. Patent No. 9,732,344 with claims directed to single-stranded antisense polynucleotide molecules of 18-20 nucleotides, comprising 10 or more phosphorothioates and 10 or more modified pyrimidine molecules.  
 Intellectual Property Related to the Delivery of siRNAs to Cells
 We also pursue internal research and collaborative approaches regarding the delivery of siRNAs to mammalian cells. These approaches include exploring technology that may allow delivery of siRNAs to cells through the use of cholesterol and carbohydrate conjugation, cationic lipids, peptide and antibody-based targeting, and polymer conjugations. Our collaborative efforts have included working with academic and corporate third parties to examine specific embodiments of these various approaches to delivery of siRNAs to appropriate cell tissue, and in-licensing and/or acquiring the most promising technology.
 In September 2014, the USPTO granted U.S. Patent No. 8,828,956 with claims directed to compositions including those comprising a modified RNA agent linked to a biantennary or triantennary ligand. Specifically, the granted patent includes claims that broadly cover single- or double-stranded, chemically modified RNA therapeutic molecules conjugated with a GalNAc ligand independent of length, sequence or disease target.
 22


The acquisition of Sirna also accelerated our overall efforts to develop and commercialize siRNA delivery technologies, including GalNAc-siRNA and GalNAc-single stranded polynucleotide conjugate technology. As part of the Sirna acquisition, we obtained several patent families directed to various conjugate technologies including “tetra-GalNAc” compositions and methods. The tetra-GalNAc cases are pending worldwide and will expire May 1, 2033. Also included were patent families directed to novel lipid compositions and formulations that are pending worldwide and set to expire May 31, 2031.
 In addition to the Sirna delivery technology, we have a license from UBC and Arbutus in the field of RNAi therapeutics to intellectual property covering cationic liposomes and their use to deliver nucleic acid to cells. 
 In addition, in April 2012, the USPTO granted U.S. Patent No. 8,158,601, covering composition of matter and formulations of the MC3 lipid, as well as methods of using these compositions and formulations. MC3 is being utilized in our patisiran development program. We assigned this patent, amongst other patents and patent applications relating to lipids and LNP technology, to Arbutus in connection with our November 2012 restructuring and cross-license agreement. We retain rights to use this intellectual property for the research, development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutic products, including the rights to sublicense this intellectual property on a product-by-product basis. A description of our 2012 restructuring and cross-license agreement with Arbutus is set forth above under “Strategic Alliances — Other Strategic License Agreements — Delivery-Related License Agreements — Arbutus.”
 Intellectual Property Related to siRNAs Directed to Specific Targets
 We have filed a number of patent applications claiming specific siRNAs directed to various gene targets that correlate to specific diseases. While there may be a significant number of competing applications filed by other organizations claiming siRNAs to treat the same gene target, we were among the first companies to focus and file on RNAi therapeutics, and thus, we believe that a number of our patent applications may predate competing applications that others may have filed. Reflecting this, in August 2005, the EPO granted a broad patent, which we call the Kreutzer-Limmer II patent, with 103 allowed claims on therapeutic compositions, methods and uses comprising siRNAs that are complementary to mRNA sequences in over 125 disease target genes. In July 2009, the EPO ruled in our favor in an opposition proceeding related to the Kreutzer-Limmer II patent. The decision had been appealed by Sirna and was subsequently withdrawn upon our acquisition of Sirna. No further appeal before the EPO is available. The Kreutzer-Limmer II patent will expire on January 9, 2022, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. Some of these claimed gene targets are being pursued by our development and pre-clinical programs, such as those expressed by viral pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. In addition, the claimed targets include oncogenes, cytokines, cell adhesion receptors, angiogenesis targets, apoptosis and cell cycle targets, and additional viral disease targets, such as hepatitis C virus and HIV. The Kreutzer-Limmer II patent series is pending in the United States and many foreign countries. Granted U.S. patent 8,618,277 obtained in the Sirna acquisition and set to expire on February 20, 2023, contains claims directed to a highly chemically modified double-stranded siRNA of between 18-24 nucleotides specifically targeting the hepatitis B virus in a sequence independent manner. Moreover, a patent in the Tuschl II patent series, U.S. Patent No. 7,078,196, claims methods of preparing siRNAs that mediate cleavage of an mRNA in mammalian cells and, therefore, covers methods of making siRNAs directed toward any and all target genes. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to these claims for RNAi therapeutics.
 In 2016, we were granted U.S. Patent Nos. 9,370,581, 9,370,582 and 9,352,048 containing claims that broadly cover single- or double-stranded RNA therapeutic molecules conjugated with any biantennary or triantennary ligand (including but not limited to GalNAc) independent of length, specifically inhibiting TTR, PCSK9 or hepatitis b virus, respectively, wherein the HBV-specific RNA molecule is fully chemically modified.
 In August 2017, we were granted U.S. Patent No. 9,738,899 with claims directed to single-stranded antisense polynucleotide molecules, capable of inhibiting expression of the human transthyretin gene, of 18-20 nucleotides, comprising 10 or more phosphorothioates and 10 or more modified pyrimidine molecules, 2’-deoxy,-O-Methyl, -Fluoro, -methoxyethoxy (MOE), pyrimidines, LNA-pyrimidines or a combination, with or without conjugation to a galactosamine or cholesterol.
 Intellectual Property Related to Our Development Candidates
 As our development pipeline matures, we have made and plan to continue to make patent filings that claim all aspects of our development candidates, including dose, method of administration and manufacture.
Intellectual Property Challenges
 As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent applications are being fully processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review 
 23


and opposition proceedings, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. On September 16, 2012, the America Invents Act went into effect and provided for expanded patent challenge, i.e., inter partes review and post-grant review. These provide additional opportunities for third parties to challenge our patents. For example, as noted in the table above, various third parties have initiated oppositions to patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl II series in the EPO, as well as in other jurisdictions. We expect that additional oppositions will be filed in the EPO and elsewhere, and other challenges will be raised relating to other patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area. A description of ongoing legal matters relating to certain aspects of our intellectual property portfolio is set forth in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical marketplace is extremely competitive, with hundreds of companies competing to discover, develop and market new drugs. We face a broad spectrum of current and potential competitors, ranging from very large, global pharmaceutical companies with significant resources, to other biotechnology companies with resources and expertise comparable to our own, to smaller biotechnology companies with fewer resources and expertise than we have. We believe that for most or all of our drug development programs, there will be one or more competing programs under development at other companies. In many cases, the companies with competing programs will have access to greater resources and expertise than we do and may be more advanced in those programs.
Competition for Our Business in General
 The competition we face can be grouped into three broad categories:
  
• | other companies working to develop RNAi and microRNA therapeutic products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies developing technology known as antisense, which, like RNAi, attempts to silence the activity of specific genes by targeting the mRNAs copied from them; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marketed products and development programs for therapeutics that treat the same diseases for which we may also be developing treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. Some of these companies are seeking, as we are, to develop chemically synthesized siRNAs as drugs. Others are following a gene therapy approach, with the goal of treating patients not with synthetic siRNAs but with synthetic, exogenously-introduced genes designed to produce siRNA-like molecules within cells.
 Companies working on chemically synthesized siRNAs include Takeda, Marina Biotech, Inc., or Marina, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, and its subsidiary, Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Calando, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Quark, Silence Therapeutics plc, or Silence, Arbutus, Sylentis, S.A.U., Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Dicerna, WAVE Life Sciences Ltd., or WAVE, and Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc., or Arcturus. Many of these companies have licensed our intellectual property. Benitec Biopharma Ltd., or Benitec, is working on gene therapy approaches to RNAi therapeutics. Companies working on microRNA therapeutics include Regulus Therapeutics, Inc., or Regulus, Rosetta Genomics Ltd., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, through its acquisition in 2014 of Santaris Pharma A/S, miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. and Asuragen, Inc.
 Antisense technology uses short, single-stranded, DNA-like molecules to block mRNAs encoding specific proteins. While we believe that RNAi drugs may potentially have significant advantages over ASOs, including greater potency and specificity, others are developing ASO drugs that are currently at a more advanced stage of development than RNAi drugs. For example, Ionis has developed several ASO drugs that have received regulatory approval. Ionis is also developing antisense drugs using ligand-conjugated GalNAc technology licensed from us, and these drugs have been shown to have increased potency at lower doses in clinical and pre-clinical studies, compared with antisense drugs that do not use such licensed GalNAc technology.  In addition, a number of other companies have ASO-based product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, including Roche, Celgene Corporation, Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea, Antisense Therapeutics, Ltd., WAVE and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. 
 The competitive landscape continues to expand and we expect that additional companies will initiate programs focused on the development of RNAi therapeutic products using the approaches described above as well as potentially new approaches that may result in the more rapid development of RNAi therapeutics or more effective technologies for RNAi drug development or delivery.

Competing Drugs for Our Investigational RNAi Therapeutics in Late Stage Clinical Development
 Hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis.    Until recently, organ transplantation was the only treatment option for patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Only a subset of patients with early stage disease qualify for this costly and invasive procedure, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. Even following liver transplantation, the disease continues to progress for many patients, presumably due to ongoing deposition of wild-type TTR protein. Currently there is only one approved drug for ATTR amyloidosis, as well as several investigational drugs in varying stages of clinical development. We believe that the following approved drugs and if approved, drug candidates, could compete with patisiran:

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing 
----------------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------
Tafamidis | Pfizer | Small molecule drug to stabilize TTR protein | Approved in the EU, Japan and certain countries in Latin America (indication varies by region) | Daily oral capsule 
Inotersen | Ionis | ASO to reduce production of TTR Protein | Registration | Subcutaneous (SC) 
PRX004 | Prothena Corporation plc | Monoclonal antibody to clear amyloid deposits | Preclinical | Unknown 
Ionis-TTR-LRx | Ionis | ASO to reduce production of TTR Protein | Preclinical | SC 
GSK 2398852 + 2315698 | GlaxoSmith Kline plc | Antibody combination to clear amyloid deposits | Phase 2 | Intravenous (IV) 
Diflunisal | N/A (generic) | Non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent | Approved | Daily oral capsule/doses
Tolcapone | SOM Biotech | Small molecule repurposed generic drug | Phase 1/2 | Daily oral dose 
AG10 | Eidos Therapeutics | Small molecule drug to stabilize TTR protein | Phase 1 | Daily oral dose 

 Acute Hepatic Porphyrias.    The only approved treatments for acute attacks are preparations of heme derived from human blood. The global market for AHP is made up of intravenous hemin in the United States and intravenous heme arginate in the EU. Both products are currently manufactured by Recordati S.p.A. Despite the lack of randomized studies demonstrating clinical efficacy, heme has been shown in case studies to hasten recovery from attacks and has been marketed since 1999 in the EU for the treatment of acute attacks of AIP, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria.
 In addition to heme, the AIPGENE consortium, a European collaboration that included industry sponsors uniQure and Digna Biotech, was developing AMT-021, a gene therapy product for the treatment of AIP, but this development program is currently on hold.  We are aware of other companies that have pre-clinical development programs for the treatment of AHPs.     
 Hemophilia.   The global market for treatments of hemophilia and bleeding disorders is valued at more than $10.0 billion. Products on the market include: Factor VIII replacement products; Factor IX replacement products; and more recently, factor replacement products with extended half-lives. For the treatment of persons with inhibitors, there is an approved Factor VIIa replacement product and an activated prothrombin complex concentrate.  In addition, new, innovative molecules are currently in development which may offer new treatments for people with hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors, including one such molecule that was recently approved for use in persons with hemophilia A with inhibitors in the United States. A number of companies are also actively developing gene therapy products that use virus-like particles to deliver a functional section of a particular gene into the liver cells of a person with hemophilia.
 25


We believe that the following approved drugs and, if approved, drug candidates, could compete with fitusiran, along with additional approved drugs and drug candidates:
 
 
Drug (Company) | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/ Dosing 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------

NovoSeven (Novo Nordisk) | Bypassing agent | Approved | IV 
Hemophilia A and B 
Concizumab, anti-TFPI (Novo Nordisk) | anti-TFPI antibody | Phase 2 | IV - Single Administration

 Hypercholesterolemia. The current standard of care for patients with hypercholesterolemia includes the use of dietary changes, lifestyle modification and the use of pharmacologic therapy. Front line therapy consists of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, which block production of cholesterol by the liver and increase clearance of LDL-C from the bloodstream. Several anti-PCSK9 antibodies have also been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe. Other PCSK9-targeted approaches are in development at a number of companies. 
 We believe that the following approved drugs and if approved, drug candidates, could compete with inclisiran:
 
 
Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing
--------------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------+----------------------
Repatha | Amgen | Anti-PSCK9 mAb | Marketed | SC 
Praluent | Sanofi | Anti-PSCK9 mAb | Marketed | SC

Other Competition
 Finally, for many of the diseases that are the subject of our early stage clinical, pre-clinical development and discovery RNAi therapeutic programs, there are already drugs on the market or in development. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe there currently exists sufficient unmet medical need to warrant the advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Regulatory Matters
 U.S. Regulatory Considerations
 The research, testing, manufacture and marketing of drug products and their delivery systems are extensively regulated in the United States and the rest of the world. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, labeling, marketing and distribution of drug products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals to test or market drug products. These sanctions could include, among other things, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, clinical holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 The steps ordinarily required before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States include nonclinical laboratory tests, animal tests and formulation studies, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical testing, approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug product is safe and effective for the indication for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA and FDA review and approval of the NDA. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes several years, but may vary substantially depending upon the complexity of the product and the nature of the disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on a company’s activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities, including but not limited to the data derived from our clinical trials for patisiran, fitusiran, givosiran and inclisiran, are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including new safety risks, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Nonclinical Tests and Clinical Trials.
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal testing to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information, analytical and stability data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information.  Clinical testing in humans may not commence until an IND is in effect.
 An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the proposed investigation(s) are subject to a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the FDA’s concerns must be resolved prior to the commencement of clinical trials. The IND review process can result in substantial delay and expense. We, an IRB, or the FDA may, at any time, suspend, terminate or impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. For example, in October 2016, we decided to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was in development for the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis, due to safety concerns. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.  For example, in September 2017, we temporarily suspended dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies pending further review of a fatal thrombotic SAE and agreement with regulatory authorities on a risk mitigation strategy. We have reached alignment with study investigators and the FDA on safety measures and a risk mitigation strategy to enable resumption of dosing in clinical studies with fitusiran, including our Phase 2 OLE study and the ATLAS Phase 3 program.
 27


Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on human subjects in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and requirements, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to assure data integrity and protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants.  Among other things, GCP requires that all research subjects provide their informed consent prior to participating in any clinical study, and that an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution and conduct continuing review throughout the trial. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to primarily assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and metabolism associated with increasing doses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to assess the optimum dosage and dose regimen, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the drug in the indication being studied.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials further evaluate the drug’s clinical efficacy, side effects and safety in an expanded patient population, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any drug candidates may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States. The FDA may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the subject. An IRB or a clinical trial sponsor also may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about certain ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.
 New Drug Applications.
 We believe that any RNAi product candidate we develop, whether for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, AHPs, hemophilia, hypercholesterolemia or the various indications targeted in our development or nonclinical discovery programs, will be regulated as a non-biological new drug by the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA is required before commercial distribution of a non-biological new drug may begin in the United States. In December 2017, we submitted our first NDA to the FDA for patisiran.  An NDA must include the results of extensive nonclinical, clinical and other testing, as described above, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, proposed labeling and other information. In addition, an NDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration typically must contain data assessing the safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, although deferrals or full or partial waivers may be available in some circumstances.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. For fiscal year 2018, the user fee for each NDA requiring clinical data is approximately $2.4 million. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each approved prescription drug, which is set at approximately $300,000 for fiscal year 2018. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals regarding the timing of its review of NDAs, although the FDA does not always meet these goals. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA normally conducts a pre-approval inspection to gain assurance that the manufacturing facility, methods and controls are 
 28


adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability, and are in compliance with regulations governing current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. In addition, the FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of select clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies to assure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP requirements.
 If the FDA evaluation of the NDA and the various inspections are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or effectiveness and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, such as a Boxed Warning, and/or distribution and use restrictions through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, all of which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be further limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or safety or other problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for registration and listing, AE reporting, submission of periodic reports, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution. Additionally, the FDA also strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, the FDA generally prohibits pharmaceutical companies from promoting their drugs or biologics for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation of any safety or effectiveness claims, including claims that one product is superior in terms of safety or effectiveness to another. Superiority claims generally must be supported by two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials. To the extent that market acceptance of our products depends on their superiority over existing therapies, any restriction on our ability to advertise or otherwise promote claims of superiority, or requirements to conduct additional expensive clinical trials to provide proof of such claims, could negatively affect the sales of our products or our costs. We must also notify the FDA of any change in an approved product beyond variations already allowed in the approval. Certain changes to the product, its labeling or its manufacturing require prior FDA approval and may require the conduct of further clinical investigations to support the change. Such approvals may be expensive and time-consuming and, if not approved, the FDA will not allow the product to be commercially distributed as modified.
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA or issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter describes the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in an application and, when possible, recommends actions that the applicant might take to allow FDA to approve the application. Such actions may include, among other things, conducting additional safety or efficacy studies. Even with the completion of this additional testing or the submission of additional requested information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of an NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor.
 Some of our product candidates may need to be administered using specialized drug delivery systems that are considered to be medical devices. We may rely on drug delivery systems that are already approved to deliver drugs like ours to similar physiological sites or, in some instances, we may need to modify the design or labeling of the legally available device for delivery of our product candidate. The FDA may regulate our product candidate when used with a specialized drug delivery system as a combination product, which could permit the combination to be approved through a single application, such as an NDA.  Alternatively, the FDA could require separate, additional approvals or clearances for the modified device. In addition, to the extent the delivery device is owned by another company, we would need that company’s cooperation to implement the necessary changes to the device and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances. Obtaining such additional approvals or clearances, and cooperation of other companies, when necessary, could significantly delay, and increase the cost of obtaining marketing approval, which could reduce the commercial viability of a product candidate. To the extent that we rely on previously unapproved drug delivery systems, we may be subject to additional testing and approval requirements from the FDA above and beyond those described above.
 Abbreviated Applications.
 Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA generally provides an abbreviated approval pathway for a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown through appropriate testing (unless waived) to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) application is a type of NDA that relies, in part, upon data the applicant does not own and to which it does not have a right of reference. Such applications typically are submitted for changes to previously approved drug products.
 29


The approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications can be delayed by patents and non-patent exclusivity covering the listed drug. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains a previously approved active ingredient if the FDA determines that new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of approval for which the new clinical investigations were essential, such as a new dosage form or indication.  Accordingly, three-year exclusivity generally protects changes to a previously approved drug product that require clinical testing for approval and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. 
 Federal law also provides a five-year period of NCE exclusivity following approval of a drug that contains a new chemical entity, or NCE.  An NCE is a drug that contains an active moiety (the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance) that has never previously been approved by the FDA. If a listed drug has NCE exclusivity, ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing the listed drug cannot be submitted to the FDA for five years unless the application contains a certification challenging a listed patent, i.e., a paragraph IV certification (discussed further below), in which case the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted four years following approval of the listed drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Additionally, applicants submitting an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing a listed drug generally are required to make a certification with respect to each patent listed in the FDA’s publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book, for the listed drug.  The only exception is if the applicant is not seeking approval of a use claimed by a method-of-use patent, in which case the applicant can submit a statement to that effect. These certifications (and statements) determine when the FDA can approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that it does not intend to market its generic product before a listed patent expires (i.e., a paragraph III certification), then the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the relevant patent expires.  If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by its proposed product, and thus that it is seeking approval prior to patent expiration (i.e., a paragraph IV certification), the statute provides a process for litigating the patent infringement issues during the FDA’s review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application.  In particular, the applicant is required to provide notice of its patent challenge to the NDA sponsor and the patent holder within certain time limits. If the patent holder then initiates a suit for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of the notice, the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until either 30 months have passed (which may be extended or shortened in certain cases) or there has been a court decision or settlement order holding or stating that the patents in question are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the patent holder does not initiate a suit for patent infringement within the 45 days, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be approved immediately upon successful completion of FDA review, unless blocked by another listed patent or regulatory exclusivity period. 
 Orphan Drug Designation (ODD).
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, as amended, the FDA may grant ODD to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering drug development costs in the United States. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. We intend to request ODD designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA has granted ODD for patisiran as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, givosiran as a therapeutic approach for AHPs, fitusiran as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia A and B, and inclisiran as a therapeutic approach for HoFH.
 If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve for seven years any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same orphan drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same structural features, and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. Notwithstanding the above definitions, a drug that is clinically superior to an orphan drug will not be considered the “same drug” and thus will not be blocked by orphan drug exclusivity.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Pediatric Study Plans.
 The FDCA, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Drugs with ODD are exempt from these requirements. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Fast Track Program.
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or –biologics license application, or BLA, meeting. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA to expedite drug development and review as well as the opportunity for priority and/or rolling review of the NDA. We intend to request Fast Track designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to patisiran for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA’s goal for taking action on an application with a Priority Review designation is six months instead of ten months. The FDA granted our request for priority review for patisiran and has set an action date of August 11, 2018 under the PDUFA. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefits. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation.
 FDASIA also amended the FDCA to require the FDA to expedite the development and review of a “breakthrough therapy.” A drug or biological product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug or biological product be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather nonclinical, manufacturing/controls and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, and allowing a rolling review. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for patisiran and givosiran. We intend to request “breakthrough therapy” designation for our other product candidates, if applicable.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement.
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Federal, state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drug products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also referred to as the Affordable Care Act or the PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
  
• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1 percent of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1 percent of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

 32


 
• | In order for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a 50 percent discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2012, the PPACA required certain manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers annually report this information to CMS, which posts this information on its website.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain drug products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The law expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Change in Laws or Policies.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be. Federal budget uncertainties or spending reductions may reduce the capabilities of the FDA, extend the duration of required regulatory reviews, and reduce the availability of clinical research grants.
EU Regulatory Considerations
 In the EU medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels.
 Clinical Trials.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an entity within the EU to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 33


Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a CTA from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.
 Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to come into application in the second half of 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority leads the scientific review of the application leading to increased information-sharing and decision-making between member states.  Each concerned member state will continue to complete an ethical review of any CTA.
 Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public by the competent authority once the CTA is approved. The results of the clinical trial must be submitted by the sponsor to the competent authorities and, with the exception of non-pediatric Phase 1 trials, will be made public at the latest within six months of the end of a pediatric clinical trial, or otherwise within 12 months after the end of the trial.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorisation application of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorisations.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, we must obtain a marketing authorisation before we may place a medicinal product on the market in the EU. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of product involved. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, or CTD, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical study and clinical trial information. There is an increasing trend in the EU towards greater transparency and, while the manufacturing or quality information is currently generally protected as confidential information, the EMA and national regulatory authorities are now liable to disclose much of the nonclinical and clinical information in marketing authorisation dossiers, including the full clinical study reports, in response to freedom of information requests after the marketing authorisation has been granted. In October 2014, the EMA adopted a policy under which clinical study reports would be posted on the agency’s website following the grant, denial or withdrawal of a marketing authorisation application, subject to procedures for limited redactions and protection against unfair commercial use. A similar requirement is contained in the new Regulation on Clinical Trials that is currently expected to take effect in the second half of 2019.
 The centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorisations that are valid throughout the EU and, by extension (after national implementing decisions), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which, together with the EU member states, comprise the European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file MAAs with the EMA, where they are reviewed by relevant scientific committees, including the CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, or EC, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorisation. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005) indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products, such as gene or cell therapy medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized marketing authorisation to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005), (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or (iii) if its authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health. In December 2017, we submitted our first MAA for patisiran under the centralized procedure, which has been accepted by the EMA.
 For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit MAAs to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing authorisation in a single EU member state; (2) the decentralized procedure, in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state, and in which the EU member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EU member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. A national procedure is only possible 
 34


for one member state; as soon as an application is submitted in a second member state the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure will be triggered.
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major interest for public health and therapeutic intervention, defined by the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach for the disease to be treated; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit of the new product. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. In November 2017, the EMA granted an accelerated assessment for patisiran.
 Data Exclusivity.
 MAAs for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorisation of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorisation is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic MAAs referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate pre-clinical studies or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Orphan Medicinal Products.
 The EMA’s COMP may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the EC adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of an MAA and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorisation. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, unless the second medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of orphan designation.  Patisiran, givosiran and fitusiran have been granted orphan medicinal product designation.
 Post-Approval Controls.
 The holder of a marketing authorisation must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorisation. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials 
 35


or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
 All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 Manufacturing.
 Medicinal products may only be manufactured in the EU, or imported into the EU from another country, by the holder of a manufacturing authorization from the competent national authority. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person, or QP, who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with EU standards of cGMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with cGMP.
Pricing and Reimbursement.
 Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the EU through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
Foreign Regulation of New Drug Compounds
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the EU, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. In particular, we plan to file for regulatory approval in Japan in mid-2018 and in one or more additional countries by the end of the year, and will have to follow the specific regulations in Japan and such other countries, which are complex.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in all or most foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Similarly, all clinical trials in Australia require, among other things, review and approval of clinical trial proposals by an ethics committee, which provides a combined ethical and scientific review process.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, which have their origin in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, the applicable regulatory requirements, and guidelines developed by the ICH for GCP in clinical trials.
 The approval procedure also varies among countries and can involve requirements for additional testing. The time required may differ from that required for FDA approval and may be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Hazardous Materials
 Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
 36


Manufacturing
 To date, we have manufactured only limited supplies of drug substance for use in IND-enabling toxicology studies in animals at our own facility, as well as patisiran formulated bulk drug product for use in clinical trials, and if approved, for commercial sale.  We have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of drug substance and finished product, other than patisiran, to meet our testing needs for pre-clinical toxicology and clinical testing. We expect to continue to rely on third-party CMOs for the supply of drug substance and certain drug product, including siRNAs and siRNA conjugates, for our product candidates for at least the next several years, including to support the launch of our first several products and to supply Sanofi Genzyme with fitusiran under the AT3 License Terms. During 2015, we amended our manufacturing agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to provide for Agilent to supply, subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, a specified percentage of the active pharmaceutical ingredients required for certain of our products in clinical development, as well as other products the parties may agree upon in the future, over an initial term of four years. We are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order. Agilent is required to reserve sufficient capacity to ensure that it can supply products in the amounts specified under such firm orders, as well as up to a certain percentage of the remaining, non-binding portions of each forecast. Subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, we have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into a separate commercial manufacturing supply agreement with Agilent for certain products, consistent with certain specified terms, including a specified minimum purchase commitment. Currently, Agilent is the sole manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for patisiran for clinical and commercial use. In April 2016, we completed our purchase of a parcel of land in Norton, Massachusetts. We have commenced construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility at this site for drug substance, including siRNAs and siRNA conjugates, for clinical and commercial use, which we currently expect to be operational in 2020.
 During 2012, we established a manufacturing facility and have developed cGMP capabilities and processes for the manufacture of patisiran formulated bulk drug product for late stage clinical trials and commercial use. During 2013, we manufactured our first cGMP batches of patisiran for use in our Phase 2 OLE and Phase 3 clinical trials. We will manufacture commercial supply for patisiran formulated bulk drug product in our facility for the foreseeable future. Commercial quantities of any drugs that we may seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with FDA regulations and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as comparable foreign regulations. 
 We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party CMOs and our current internal cGMP manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and commercial needs and the needs of Sanofi Genzyme for clinical supply. We believe that the supply capacity we have established externally, together with the internal capacity we developed to support pre-clinical trials, our existing facility for patisiran formulated bulk drug product and the new facility we are building, will be sufficient to meet our and Sanofi Genzyme’s anticipated needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our CMOs and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity to meet our and Sanofi Genzyme’s currently anticipated needs. We also believe that our products can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs.
 Commercial Operations
 After successfully overcoming various challenges associated with developing a potential new class of innovative medicines - such as solving the issue of drug delivery, optimizing our RNAi therapeutics to exhibit potency and durability of effect, and designing and carrying out comprehensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and clinical efficacy of our investigational products - we now embark on the next part of the journey; introducing our RNAi therapeutics to as many eligible patients in need as possible. To meet that new challenge, we have started to build a global commercial operation which will be fully integrated and ready to sequentially manage the potential of multiple product launches across multiple geographies. As a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we intend to leverage the internal knowledge accumulated at Alnylam as well as hire talented people from industry to commercialize our products ourselves in key countries globally. The conduct of these commercial activities will be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements that we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators, currently as follows with respect to our late-stage clinical programs: 

• | For patisiran, we now have global rights to develop and commercialize patisiran, pending approval by regulatory authorities, and other TTR products, including ALN-TTRsc02 and any back-ups, as a result of the 2018 amendment to the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration and the related Exclusive TTR License;

Throughout the development of our product candidates, we have remained focused on keeping patients at the center of everything we do. This patient focus will continue as we transition towards commercialization. Moreover, the late stage programs we are advancing to commercialization are focused on orphan diseases, and these patients and their families are often in need of more than just a product. It is our goal to identify information, education solutions and services that benefit these patients and their families, and to have a rich patient services approach in these orphan diseases. In addition, we are focused early in the product development cycle on establishing evidence that we can bring to payors about the overall burden of disease and pharmacoeconomic opportunities that our product candidates represent to ensure access for patients. 
 We are assembling the key components of a global commercial organization with a focus on preparation for the anticipated commercial launch of patisiran in 2018, assuming regulatory approval is obtained. We have already initiated a staged build of commercial capabilities with the planned hire of approximately 250 employees deployed in customer facing activities across the world, initially in the United States and major European countries, followed by Canada and Switzerland, with a phased approach to the Asia Pacific, Latin American and Middle Eastern regions. We plan to build a focused commercial team with broad experience in marketing, sales, patient access, patient services, distribution and product reimbursement, in particular for orphan diseases.  In the coming months, we will continue to expand our footprint in major European markets and beyond.  During 2017, as we prepared for a potential patisiran commercial launch in the United States and Europe in 2018, we continued to expand our commercial organization, incorporating the appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as implementing internal systems and infrastructure in order to support commercial sales, and the establishment of patient-focused programs. Given our accelerated global commercial opportunity, we intend to expand these capabilities more broadly during 2018 as we strategically assess the global opportunity for patisiran. Ultimately, we intend to leverage the commercial infrastructure that we build to support the potential launches of givosiran and ALN-TTRsc02.  Our objective is to be ready to execute successful product launches. For many territories/countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products.
 Employees
 At January 31, 2018, we had 749 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work stoppages. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
