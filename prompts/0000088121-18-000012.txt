Other further processing companies also purchase fresh and frozen pork products in bulk and produce products, such as lunchmeat, ham, bacon and sausage. Fresh pork, such as loins, tenderloins and ribs are sold to distributors and grocery stores. The Pork division’s hog processing plant is located in Oklahoma and generally operates at capacity. The Pork division also has a ham-boning and processing plant in Mexico.
 The Pork division’s hog production operations consist of the breeding and raising of over five million hogs annually primarily at facilities owned by Seaboard or at facilities owned and operated by third parties with whom Seaboard has grower contracts. The hog production operations are located in the Central U.S. As a part of the hog production operations, the Pork division produces specially formulated feed for the hogs at seven owned feed mills. The remaining hogs processed are purchased from third-party hog producers, primarily pursuant to purchase contracts.
 The Pork division produces biodiesel at facilities in Oklahoma and Missouri. The biodiesel is produced from pork fat supplied by the division’s Oklahoma pork processing plant and from other animal fat or vegetable oil supplied by non-Seaboard facilities. The biodiesel is sold to fuel blenders for distribution and in the retail markets.
 The Pork division earns fees to market substantially all of the products produced by Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”) at its pork processing plant located in Missouri, and by Seaboard Triumph Foods, LLC (“STF”) at its pork processing plant located in Iowa. As part of the operations, Seaboard and Triumph sell a portion of their hogs to be processed at the STF plant. Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in STF.
 The Pork division has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily’s Premium Meats, LLC (“Daily’s”). Daily’s produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon and ham under the Daily’s® brand name primarily for the food service industry and, to a lesser extent, retail markets.

 Commodity Trading and Milling Division – Seaboard’s Commodity Trading and Milling (“CT&M”) division is an integrated agricultural commodity trading, processing and logistics company. This division markets wheat, corn, soybean meal and other commodities in bulk to third parties and affiliated companies.

 On January 5, 2018, the CT&M division acquired five entities operating as Groupe Mimran (“Mimran”). Mimran operates three flour mills and an associated trading business located in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Monaco. Excluding the acquisition of Mimran, the CT&M division sources, transports and markets approximately ten million tons of agricultural commodities on an annual basis. All of the commodities marketed by this division are purchased from growing regions worldwide, with primary destinations being Africa, South America, the Caribbean and Asia. 
 The CT&M division also operates grain and feed milling and related businesses with 38 locations in 20 countries, including wheat flour mills in 16 countries, which are primarily supplied by the trading locations discussed above. The grain processing businesses are operated through 6 consolidated and 18 non-consolidated affiliates in Africa, South America, the Caribbean and Europe. These are primarily flour, feed and maize milling and oilseed crush businesses, which produce approximately five million metric tons of finished products per year. In addition, this division has a noncontrolling interest in poultry businesses in Africa and a bakery business in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the products produced by these operations are sold in the countries in which the products are produced or into adjacent countries.

Seaboard’s Marine division uses a network of offices and agents throughout the U.S., Canada, Central and South America and the Caribbean to book cargo to and from the U.S. and between the countries it serves. Through agreements with a network of connecting carriers, this division can transport cargo to and from numerous U.S. locations by either truck or rail to and from one of its U.S. port locations, where it is staged for export via vessel or received as import cargo from abroad.
 The Marine division’s primary operations are located in Miami, Florida and includes a terminal located at PortMiami and off-dock warehouses for cargo consolidation and temporary storage.

 Sugar Division – Seaboard, through its subsidiaries, Ingenio y Refineria San Martin del Tabacal S.R.L. and Alconoa S.R.L., as well as other Argentine non-consolidated affiliates, grows sugarcane, which it uses to produce refined sugar and alcohol in Argentina. This division also purchases sugar and alcohol in bulk from third parties mostly within Argentina for subsequent resale. The sugar products are mostly sold in Argentina, primarily to retailers, soft drink manufacturers and food manufacturers, with some exports to the U.S. and other South American countries. Seaboard’s Sugar division grows a large portion of the sugarcane on the nearly 70,000 acres of land it owns in northern Argentina. The cane is processed at an owned mill, one of the largest in Argentina, with a current processing capacity of approximately 250,000 metric tons of sugar and approximately 27 million gallons of alcohol per year. Also, this division owns a 51 megawatt cogeneration power plant that is fueled by using sugarcane by-products, natural gas and other biomass when available.

Republic. Seaboard’s Power division operates one owned power generating barge with capacity to generate approximately 108 megawatts of electricity that is secured on the Ozama River in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The facility consists of a system of diesel engines mounted onto barge-type vessels and is capable of using natural gas or heavy fuel oil. This operation is exempt from U.S. regulations under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1938, as amended. Seaboard’s Power division is not directly involved in the transmission or distribution of electricity and primarily sells on the spot market to wholly government-owned distribution companies. This division also has a 29.9% noncontrolling interest in a 300 megawatt electricity generating facility among a few other equity method investments in energy-related businesses in the Dominican Republic.
 Turkey Segment – Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling voting interest in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”). Butterball is a vertically integrated producer, processor and marketer of branded and non-branded turkey products. Butterball has four processing plants, two further processing plants and numerous live production and feed milling operations located in North Carolina, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas.

Butterball is a national supplier to retail and foodservice outlets, and also exports products to Mexico and numerous other foreign markets.
 Other Businesses – Seaboard processes jalapeño peppers at its plant in Honduras, which are primarily shipped to and sold in the U.S.
 The information required by this item with respect to the amount or percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar products or services, which account for 10% or more of consolidated revenue in any of the last three fiscal years, is set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Seaboard’s Annual Report to Stockholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
 (ii) Status of Product or Segment
 In August 2017, the Pork division acquired hog inventory and related assets from an existing farm operation for an investment of $40 million. This acquisition provided additional sows to further increase Seaboard’s capacity to fulfill its hog supply commitment for processing at the STF plant, which began operations in September 2017.
 During 2017, the CT&M division acquired a pulse and grain elevator in Canada for $14 million that complements an existing CT&M business in Canada, and invested an additional $7 million in a grain trading and poultry business in Morocco. The additional investment increased Seaboard’s ownership interest in this Moroccan business to 19.4% and, as a result, Seaboard changed its accounting method from the cost method to equity method effective on the date of the additional investment. On January 5, 2018, the CT&M division completed the acquisition of Mimran, including three flour mills in Senegal and Ivory Coast having a combined capacity of approximately 2,750 metric tons a day, and a trading business located in Monaco that is expected to increase Seaboard’s annual grain trading volume by approximately 900,000 tons. The purchase price was $375 million, plus an earn-out between zero and $48 million, using the exchange rate in effect at closing.
 Butterball closed its Montgomery, Illinois, further processing plant in 2017, resulting in charges primarily related to impaired fixed assets and accrued severance. Seaboard’s proportionate share of these charges, recognized in income (loss) from affiliates, was $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 (iii) Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 None of Seaboard’s businesses utilize material amounts of raw materials that are dependent on purchases from one supplier or a small group of dominant suppliers except the following: the Power segment has one primary supplier of natural gas, but the barge can run on other types of fuel; and the Turkey segment purchases a significant portion of its feed and grain used in the manufacturing of feed for its turkeys in North Carolina from Seaboard’s 50% partner in Butterball.

 Seaboard’s commodity trading business to third parties faces competition from numerous traders around the world in a very competitive environment with low margin percentages on most trades. Most of the grain processing and related businesses face competition from either imported products or other local producers in the same industries.
 Seaboard’s Marine division faces competition based on price, reliable sailing frequencies and customer service. Seaboard believes it is among the top five ranking ocean liner services for cargoes in the Caribbean and Central America based on cargo volume.

 Competition for the Turkey segment comes from a variety of national and regional producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. Butterball ranks as one of the nation’s top three turkey producers (based on live production).
 (xi) Research and Development Activities
 Seaboard’s Pork division and Turkey segment each conduct research and development activities focused on various aspects of their respective vertically integrated pork and turkey processing systems, including improving product quality, production processes, animal genetics, nutrition and health.

Seaboard’s Pork division and Turkey segment do not anticipate making expenditures for these purposes that, in the aggregate, would have a significant effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations.
 (xiii) Number of Persons Employed by Registrant

(d) | Financial Information about Geographic Areas
----+---------------------------------------------

  In addition to the narrative disclosure provided below, the financial information relating to export sales required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Seaboard’s Annual Report to Stockholders.
 Seaboard considers its relations with the governments of the countries in which its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are located to be satisfactory, but foreign operations in lesser-developed countries are subject to risks of doing business such as potential civil unrest and government instability, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, sales price controls, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls. To minimize certain of these risks, Seaboard has insured its investment in an affiliated flour mill in the Democratic Republic of Congo to the extent available and deemed appropriate with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency of the U.S. Government. At the date of this report, Seaboard is not aware of any situations that could have a material effect on Seaboard’s business.
