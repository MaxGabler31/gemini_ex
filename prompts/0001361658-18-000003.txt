ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW
Wyndham Worldwide
We are one of the world’s largest hospitality companies, offering travelers a wide range of hospitality services and products through our global portfolio of world-renowned brands. The hospitality industry is a major component of the travel industry, which is one of the largest retail industry segments of the global economy. Our portfolio of brands has a significant presence in many major hospitality markets in the United States and throughout the world and are uniquely positioned to provide travelers access to a large assortment of travel accommodations and destinations. Our brands include: Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8, Howard Johnson, Wingate by Wyndham, Microtel Inns & Suites by Wyndham, TRYP by Wyndham, Dolce Hotels and Resorts, RCI, Wyndham Vacation Rentals, Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Shell Vacations Club and WorldMark by Wyndham. 
During the third quarter of 2017, we decided to explore strategic alternatives for our European vacation rentals business, which was previously part of our Wyndham Destination Network segment, and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced activities to facilitate the sale of this business. As a result, for all periods presented, we have classified the results of operations for our European vacation rentals business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with this business as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All results and information presented exclude our European vacation rentals business unless otherwise noted (see Note 3 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 
On February 15, 2018, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our European vacation rentals business for approximately $1.3 billion. In conjunction with the sale, the European vacation rentals business will also enter into a 20-year agreement under which it will pay a royalty fee of 1% of net revenue to Wyndham’s hotel business for the right to use the by “Wyndham Vacation Rentals” endorser brand. In addition, the European vacation rentals business will also participate as a redemption partner in the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. We have also agreed to provide certain post-closing credit support in order to ensure that the buyer meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities. The agreement is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.

Our continuing operations are grouped into three segments: Hotel Group, Destination Network and Vacation Ownership.

• | Wyndham Hotel Group is the world’s largest hotel company based on the number of properties, with 8,422 affiliated hotels and over 728,000 hotel rooms worldwide. We franchise in the upscale, upper midscale, midscale, economy and extended stay segments with a concentration in economy brands. We also provide property management services for full-service and select limited-service hotels. This is predominantly a fee-for-service business that produces recurring revenue streams with steady cash flow and low capital investment requirements.


• | Wyndham Destination Network operates the world’s largest vacation exchange network, with approximately 3.9 million members, and is a leading provider of professionally managed vacation rentals in North America. Our vacation exchange business has relationships with over 4,300 vacation ownership resorts located in 110 countries and territories, and our vacation rentals business offers North American-based rental properties in nearly 50 destinations. This is primarily a fee-for-service business that provides stable revenue streams and produces strong cash flow.


• | Wyndham Vacation Ownership is the world’s largest timeshare (also known as vacation ownership) business based on the number of resorts, units, owners and revenues, with 221 resorts and over 878,000 owners. We develop and market Vacation Ownership Interests (“VOIs”) to individual consumers, provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of VOIs and provide property management services at resorts.

Our business segments generate a diversified revenue stream and high free cash flow. Approximately 57% of our revenues are generated from our fee-for-service businesses. We derive our fee revenues principally from (i) franchise fees received from hotels for use of our brand names and providing marketing and reservation activities, (ii) providing property management services to hotels and vacation ownership resorts, (iii) providing vacation exchange and rentals services and (iv) providing services under our Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model (“WAAM”) in our timeshare business. The remainder of our revenue comes primarily from the sale of VOIs and related financing.
Our European vacation rentals business, which is classified as a discontinued operation, offers guests access to over 110,000 vacation rentals properties, including cottages, city apartments, holiday park lodges, bungalows, holiday camping sites and boats located in more than 30 countries primarily in Europe, as well as other parts of the world. We primarily market vacation rentals properties that are owned by third parties.

How we create value for our shareholders
Our mission is to increase shareholder value by offering the widest ranges of places to stay thereby allowing customers to experience travel the way they want. Our collective brands provide travelers with more than 129,000 places to stay in over 110 countries and territories on six continents. Our strategies to achieve these objectives are to:

• | Strategically allocate capital to expand our fee-for-service business models;


• | Increase cash flow and profitability through superior execution;


• | Develop innovative services and products to meet the evolving needs of customers; and


• | Further develop our world-class capabilities by strengthening our brands, attracting and developing the best talent and investing in technology.

We provide value-added services and products and also support and promote green and diversity initiatives to enhance the travel experience of the individual consumer and to drive revenues to our business customers. 
In 2017, we announced our intent to spin-off our hotel business, which will result in our operations being held by two separate, publicly-traded companies. The two public companies intend to enter into long-term exclusive license agreements to retain their affiliation with one of the industry’s top-rated loyalty programs, Wyndham Rewards, as well as to continue to collaborate on inventory-sharing and customer cross-sell initiatives. The transaction is expected to result in enhanced strategic and management focus on the core business and growth of each company; more efficient capital allocation, direct access to capital and expanded growth opportunities for each company; the ability to implement a tailored approach to recruiting and retaining employees at each company; improved investor understanding of the business strategy and operating results of each company; and enhanced investor choice by offering investment opportunities in separate entities. The transaction will be effected through a pro rata distribution of the new hotel company’s stock to our shareholders and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. 
All of our businesses have both domestic and international operations. During 2017, we derived 87% of our revenues in the United States and 13% internationally (approximately 1% in Europe and 12% in all other international regions). For a discussion of our segment revenues, profits, assets and geographical operations, see Note 22 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
History and Development 
Our corporate history can be traced back to the formation of Hospitality Franchise Systems (“HFS”) in 1990. HFS initially began as a hotel franchisor that later expanded to include the addition of the vacation exchange business. In December 1997, HFS merged with CUC International, Inc. to form Cendant Corporation, which then further expanded with the addition of the vacation rentals and vacation ownership businesses. On July 31, 2006, Cendant distributed all of the shares of its subsidiary, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham” or the “Company”), to the holders of Cendant common stock issued and outstanding as of July 21, 2006 (the record date for the distribution). The separation was effective on July 31, 2006. On August 1, 2006, we commenced “regular way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WYN”.
We have many widely recognized and well-established brands. Our Howard Johnson and Ramada brands opened their first hotels in 1954. RCI, our vacation exchange business, was established in 1974. Our vacation ownership brands began operations in 1978 with Shell Vacations Club, followed by Wyndham Vacation Resorts (formerly known as Fairfield Resorts) in 1980 and WorldMark by Wyndham (formerly known as Trendwest Resorts) in 1989.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS 
The following is a description of each of our three business segments, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and the industries in which they compete.
WYNDHAM HOTEL GROUP 
Hotel Industry 
Regions
The global hotel industry consists of approximately 178,000 hotels with combined annual revenues of approximately $479 billion. This represents over 16.3 million rooms, of which approximately 54% are affiliated with a brand. The industry is geographically concentrated with the top 20 countries accounting for over 84% of total rooms.
The regional distribution of the hotel industry consists of the following (according to Smith Travel Research Global (“STR”)):

 | | Room Supply | | Revenues | Brand 
Region | Hotels | (millions) | | (billions) | Affiliation
United States/Canada | 60,990 | | 5.6 | | $ | 157 | | 70 | %
Europe | 68,329 | | 4.7 | | 156 | | 40 | % 
Asia Pacific | 35,551 | | 4.6 | | 120 | | 53 | % 
Latin America/Middle East | 13,354 | | 1.5 | | 46 | | 45 | % 

Business Models
Companies in the hotel industry operate primarily under one of the following business models:

• | Franchise - Under the franchise model, a company typically grants the use of a brand name to a hotel owner in exchange for royalty fees that are typically a percentage of room sales. Since the royalty fees are a recurring revenue

stream and the cost structure is relatively low, the franchise model yields high margins and steady, predictable cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, we had 8,304 franchised properties in our hotel portfolio.

• | Management - Under the management model, a company provides professional oversight and comprehensive operations support to hotel owners in exchange for base management fees that are typically a percentage of hotel revenue. A company can also earn incentive management fees which are tied to the financial performance of the hotel. As of December 31, 2017, we had 116 managed properties in our hotel portfolio.


• | Ownership - Under the ownership model, a company owns hotels and bears all financial risks and rewards relating to the hotel, including appreciation and depreciation in the value of the property. As of December 31, 2017, we had two owned hotels in our portfolio.

Operating Statistics
Performance in the hotel industry is measured by the following key operating statistics:

• | Average daily rate, or ADR - ADR is defined as total revenue divided by the number of room nights sold. It represents the average price of a room at a hotel or group of hotels.


• | Average occupancy - Occupancy is the number of room nights sold divided by the total number of rooms. Average occupancy allows us to gauge demand.


• | Revenue per available room, or RevPAR - RevPAR is calculated by multiplying ADR by the average occupancy rate; it is the average price of a room multiplied by the percentage of rooms occupied. RevPAR is the primary metric used by our management to track the performance of our hotels, and it allows us to compare performance across regions, segments and brands.


• | System growth - System growth is derived from the number of gross rooms opened less rooms terminated during the year. System growth provides a measure for the number of rooms added to our portfolio.

The United States is the largest country in the global lodging market with approximately 33% of global room revenues. The following table displays trends in the key revenue metrics for the U.S. lodging industry over the last six years:

Year | Occupancy | ADR | RevPAR (*)
2012 | 61.4% | 106.05 | | 65.13
2013 | 62.3% | 110.03 | | 68.51
2014 | 64.4% | 115.14 | | 74.12
2015 | 65.4% | 120.30 | | 78.68
2016 | 65.5% | 123.97 | | 81.19
2017 | 65.9% | 126.72 | | 83.57

(*) RevPAR may not recalculate by multiplying occupancy by ADR due to rounding.
Sources: STR (2012-2017), PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) (2017).
The U.S. lodging industry experienced positive RevPAR performance over the prior year primarily resulting from higher ADR and an increase in U.S. occupancy of 0.6% to 65.9% in 2017. During 2017, ADR grew 2.2% to $126.72. As a result of the ADR gain, the U.S. lodging industry experienced RevPAR growth of 2.9% in 2017.
Segment Descriptions
Performance in the U.S. lodging industry is evaluated based upon chain scale segments, which are generally defined as follows:

• | Luxury - typically offers first-class accommodations and an extensive range of on-property amenities and services, including restaurants, spas, recreational facilities, business centers, concierges, room service and local transportation (shuttle service to airport and/or local attractions). ADR is normally greater than $210 for hotels in this category.

6


• | Upper Upscale - typically offers a full range of on-property amenities and services, including restaurants, spas, recreational facilities, business centers, concierges, room service and local transportation (shuttle service to airport and/or local attractions). ADR normally falls in the range of $145 to $210 for hotels in this category.

• | Economy - typically offers basic amenities and a limited breakfast. ADR is normally less than $65 for hotels in this category.

Wyndham Hotel Group Overview
Wyndham Hotel Group is the world’s largest hotel franchisor based on number of properties, with 8,422 franchised hotels and over 728,000 hotel rooms worldwide, and is a leader in the economy segment. Our franchise business is easily adaptable to changing economic environments due to low operating cost structures. This, in combination with recurring fee streams, yields high margins and predictable cash flows. Ongoing capital requirements are relatively low and mostly limited to technology expenditures which support core capabilities. We may employ key money incentives and other forms of financial support to generate new business and to assist franchisees and hotel owners in converting to one of our brands or building new hotels under a Wyndham Hotel Group brand.
Our owned hotel portfolio currently consists of the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa in Puerto Rico (“Rio Mar hotel”) and the Wyndham Grand Orlando Bonnet Creek (“Bonnet Creek hotel”). Both hotels represent mixed-use opportunities which allow us to introduce our hotel guests to the vacation ownership product.

(*) | During 2017, 61% of our room additions were conversions. Acquisitions accounted for 11,877 and 2,171 room additions during 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In our franchising business, we seek to generate revenues for our hotel owners through our strong, well-known brands and the delivery of services such as marketing, information technology, revenue management, training, operations support, strategic sourcing and guest services.
Revenues
The sources of our revenues from franchising hotels include (i) ongoing franchise fees, which are comprised of royalty, marketing and reservation fees, (ii) initial franchise fees which relate to services provided to assist a franchised hotel to open for business under one of our brands and (iii) other service fees. Royalty fees are intended to cover the use of our trademarks. Marketing and reservation fees are intended to reimburse us for expenses associated with operating reservations systems, e-commerce channels including our brand.com websites and access to third-party distribution channels, such as online travel agents (“OTAs”), advertising and marketing programs, global sales efforts, operations support, training and other related services. Other service fees include fees derived from providing ancillary services and are generally intended to reimburse us for direct expenses associated with providing these services.
Our management business offers hotel owners the benefits of a global brand and a full range of management, marketing and reservation services. In addition to the standard franchise services, our hotel management business provides hotel owners with professional oversight and comprehensive operations support, including hiring, training and supervising the hotel managers and employees, annual budget preparation, local sales and marketing efforts, financial analysis, and food and beverage services. Revenues earned from our management business include management and service fees. Management fees are comprised of (i) base fees, which are typically a specified percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations, and (ii) incentive fees, which are typically a specified percentage of a hotel’s gross operating profit. Service fees include fees derived from accounting, design, construction and purchasing services and technical assistance provided to managed hotels. We also recognize as revenue, fees related to reimbursable payroll costs for operational employees who work at some of our managed hotels. Although these costs are funded by hotel owners, accounting guidance requires us to report these fees on a gross basis as both revenues and expenses. As such, there is no effect on our operating income.
9

Our ownership portfolio is limited to two hotels in locations where we have developed timeshare units. Revenues earned from our owned hotels are comprised of (i) gross room nights, (ii) food and beverage services, and (iii) on-site spa, casino, golf and shop revenues. We are responsible for all operations and recognize all revenues and expenses associated with the hotels.
We also earn marketing fees from the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program when a member stays at a participating hotel. Revenues are derived from a fee we charge based upon a percentage of room revenues generated from such member stays. These fees reimburse us for expenses associated with member redemptions and the overall administration and marketing of the program. In addition, we earn revenue from our co-branded Wyndham Rewards credit card program which is primarily generated by cardholder spending activity and the enrollment of new cardholders. This program is designed to further incentivize loyalty to our brands. 
Reservation Booking Channels
A majority of our economy and midscale hotels are located on highway roadsides for convenience of travelers; therefore, a significant portion of room nights sold are on a walk-in or direct-to-hotel basis. We believe their choice of hotel is influenced by the reputation and general recognition of our brand names.
Another significant component of our value proposition to a hotel owner is access to our reservation booking channels, which we also refer to as our distribution platform. These channels include: our proprietary brand web and mobile sites; our mobile apps; our call center facilities; our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program; our global sales team; global distribution partners such as Sabre and Amadeus; and OTAs and other third-party internet referral or booking sources, such as Kayak, TripAdvisor and Google. Over half of our reservation delivery comes from online sources, including our proprietary and mobile websites. 
For guests who choose to book their hotel stay in advance through our distribution platform, we booked over $4 billion in room revenue on behalf of hotels within our system (including bookings under our global sales agreements). This represents 50% of total room revenues at these hotels, compared to 48% during 2016. 
A key strategy for reservation delivery is the continual investment in our e-commerce capabilities (websites, mobile and other online channels), as well as the deployment of advertising spend to drive online traffic to our proprietary e-commerce channels. This strategy also encompasses marketing agreements we have with travel related search websites and affiliate networks, and other initiatives to drive business directly to our online channels. In addition, to ensure our franchisees receive bookings from OTAs and other third-party internet sources, we provide direct connections between our central reservations systems and strategic third-party internet booking sources. These direct connections allow us to deliver more accurate and consistent rates and inventory rooms, send bookings directly to our central reservation systems without interference or delay and reduce our franchisee distribution costs.
As part of our strategy to bring industry-leading technology to our hotel owners, we are currently migrating our multiple reservations systems to Sabre Corporation’s SynXis Central Reservations solution. This web-based solution provides our hotel owners with distribution of rates and inventory through online and offline distribution channels; connectivity to global distribution systems, online travel agents, website and mobile booking engines; and seamless integration of property, revenue management, loyalty and content systems, providing holistic views of hotel guests and revenue. As of December 31, 2017, eleven of our twenty hotel brands have migrated to SynXis Central Reservations. The remainder of our portfolio is expected to migrate in 2018.
Property Services
Our worldwide teams of industry veterans continually collaborate with franchisees on all aspects of their operations, and create detailed and individualized strategies for success. We are able to make meaningful contributions to hotel operations, which result in higher revenues for our hotel owners by providing key services including system integration, operations support, training, strategic sourcing, and development planning and construction.
Loyalty Program
Building a robust loyalty program is critical to delivering our value proposition to our hotel owners. In May 2015, we launched a newly redesigned Wyndham Rewards program offering members a more generous points earning structure along with a flat, free-night redemption rate, the first of its kind for a major rewards program.
10

The Wyndham Rewards program was introduced in 2003 and has grown steadily since its inception. The diversity of our brands and significant footprint uniquely enables us to meet our members’ leisure and business travel needs across a variety of locations, and a wide range of price points. Wyndham Rewards members stay at our brands more frequently and drive incremental room nights, higher ADR and a longer length of stay than non-members.
Wyndham Rewards is the largest lodging loyalty program as measured by number of participating hotels in the lodging industry. Members earn points by staying in one of our participating branded hotels or by purchasing everyday services and products using a co-branded Wyndham Rewards credit card. Points may be redeemed for a variety of reward options, including airline travel, resort vacations, event tickets, gift certificates for leading retailers and restaurants, and more. Members can also redeem points (“go free”) or a combination of points plus cash (“go fast”) for free-night hotel stays. During 2016, we introduced four distinct member levels to the Wyndham Rewards program (Blue, Gold, Platinum and Diamond) that provide members with additional benefits that increase by level. During 2017, 86% of all points redeemed were for go free and go fast awards, demonstrating the impact of the program in driving additional stays to our hotel owners. As part of our “Blue Thread” initiative, we expanded our global Rewards program during 2016 by allowing points to be redeemed at over 20,000 Wyndham Vacation Ownership resorts and Wyndham Destination Network properties. 
Marketing, Sales and Revenue Management Services 
Our brand and field marketing teams develop and implement global marketing strategies for each of our hotel brands. While brand positioning and strategy are generated from our U.S. headquarters, we have seasoned marketing professionals positioned around the globe to modify and implement these strategies on a local market level. Our marketing efforts communicate the unique value proposition of each of our individual brands, and are designed to build consumer awareness and drive business to our hotels, either directly or through our own reservation channels.
We deploy a variety of marketing strategies and tactics depending on the needs of the specific brand and local market, including online advertising, social media marketing, traditional media planning and buying (radio, television and print), creative development, promotions, sponsorships and highly targeted direct marketing. Our Best Available Rate guarantee gives consumers confidence to book directly with us by guaranteeing the same rates regardless of whether they book through our call centers, websites or other third-party channels. Our marketing strategy allows us to better optimize the efficiency of our advertising dollars by strategically grouping brands together for select initiatives with the goal of driving more customers to our proprietary websites and our loyalty program. These efforts drive tens of millions of consumer impressions.
Our global sales organization leverages the size and diversification of our portfolio to gain a larger share of business for each of our hotels through relationship-based selling to a broad range of hotel guests including corporate business travel clients, corporate group clients, association markets, consortium and travel agent clients, wholesale leisure clients, social group clients, and specialty markets such as trucking companies and travel clubs. With over 8,000 hotels throughout the world, we are able to find more complete solutions for a client/company whose travel needs range from economy to upscale brands. Our Dolce Hotels and Resorts (“Dolce”) brand provides Wyndham with a portfolio of hotels that primarily cater to meeting and conference functions. In order to leverage multidimensional customer needs for our hotels, the sales team is deployed globally in key markets within Europe, Latin America, India, Canada, China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East and the United States.
We also offer several levels of revenue management subscription services, with professionals deployed in key markets globally, to help maximize the revenues of our franchisees by advising them on strategies intended to optimize rate and inventory management. These services also coordinate all recommended revenue programs delivered to our franchisees in tandem with e-commerce and brand marketing strategies.
A key element of our value proposition to franchisees is reservation delivery and profit optimization. Our cloud-based, web-enabled, state-of-the-art technology platform, which includes a fully integrated property management, reservation and revenue management system, is provided to all our franchisees at an affordable price. Our scale enables franchisees to take advantage of attractive pricing, and this cloud-based solution eliminates the need for our franchisees to purchase or maintain an on-site server, which traditionally has been a significant cost to hotel owners. Our platform simplifies the revenue management process by automatically analyzing each hotel’s booking data on a daily basis, recognizing trends and patterns, and providing our hotel owners with rate and inventory management recommendations to help optimize the hotel’s demand. Our hotel owners are able to more effectively manage their pricing and inventory, connect to a wider range of global distribution partners, utilize a broad array of currency and language capabilities and have access to a fully integrated customer profile and history tied into our Wyndham Rewards program. We completed our migration of more than 4,500 of our franchised hotels to this new technology platform in 2017.

Franchise Development
Our franchise development team consists of over 100 professionals in locations throughout the world, including Europe, Latin America, India, China, Australia, the Middle East and the United States. Our development team is focused on growing our franchise business, and their efforts typically target existing franchisees as well as hotel developers, owners of independent hotels and owners of hotels leaving competitor brands.
In addition, our development team is focused on growing our management business, particularly in the top 25 U.S. markets, with properties and hotel owners who will raise the profile and performance of our hotel brands. Our hotel management business gives us access to development opportunities beyond pure-play franchising transactions. When a hotel owner is seeking both a brand and a manager, we are able to couple these services into one offering. 
The number of hotel group properties and rooms in our pipeline as of December 31, 2017 is as follows: 

 | U.S.* | International | | Total 
 | Properties | Rooms | | Properties | Rooms | Properties | | Rooms
Conversions | 399 | | 37,384 | | 98 | | 9,805 | | 497 | 47,189 
New Construction | 264 | | 25,408 | | 396 | | 75,580 | | 660 | 100,988
Total | 663 | | 62,792 | | 494 | | 85,385 | | 1,157 | 148,177

* Includes Puerto Rico.
Many of our hotel conversions are not captured in our pipeline statistics as the period from signing the contract to flagging the hotel often occurs within the same quarter.
In North America, we generally employ a direct franchise model whereby we contract with and provide various services directly to hotel owners. Under our direct franchise model, we principally market our hotel group brands to hotel developers, owners of independent hotels, and hotel owners who have the right to terminate their existing franchise affiliations with other hotel brands. We also market franchises to existing franchisees since many own, or may own in the future, other hotels that can be converted to one of our brands. Our standard franchise agreement grants a franchisee the right to non-exclusive use of the applicable franchise system in the operation of a single hotel at a specified location, typically for a period of 10 to 20 years. It also gives the franchisor and franchisee certain rights to terminate the franchise agreement before its end date under certain circumstances, such as upon the lapse of a certain number of years after commencement of the agreement. Early termination options in these agreements give us the flexibility to terminate franchised hotels if business circumstances warrant. We also have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for failure by a franchisee to bring its property into compliance with contractual or quality standards within specified periods of time, pay required franchise fees or comply with other requirements of the agreement.
While we generally employ a direct franchise model in North America, we currently own two hotels, the Bonnet Creek hotel, which is situated in our Bonnet Creek vacation ownership resort near the Walt Disney World resort in Florida, and the Rio Mar hotel oceanfront property that includes premier restaurants, a spa, casino, golf course, and comprehensive business center, which is located in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. Both of these hotels are mixed-use properties consisting of both hotel and timeshare components. These mixed-use properties enable us to leverage the synergies of our owned hotels and vacation ownership elements and provide us with opportunities to generate cross-product interest by exposing our hotel guests to the vacation ownership product. Additionally, under our mixed-use business model, we are able to provide our hotel guests and VOI owners with higher-quality amenities.
In other parts of the world, we employ both a direct franchise and master franchise model. We generally employ a master franchise model in regions where we can accelerate our growth and expansion through a strong in-market business partner. For example, while we employ a direct franchising model in China for our Wyndham and Ramada brands, we use a master franchise model for our Super 8, Days Inn and Howard Johnson brands. Similarly, within Canada, we generally employ a direct franchising model for our brands with the exception of our Days Inn and Travelodge brands, for which we use a master franchise model.
Franchise agreements in regions outside of North America may carry a lower fee structure based on the services we are prepared to provide in that particular region. Under our master franchise model we typically market our hotel group brands to third parties that assume the principal role of franchisor, which involves selling individual franchise agreements and 
12

providing quality assurance, marketing assistance and reservations support to franchisees. Since we provide only limited services to master franchisors, the fees we receive in connection with these agreements are typically lower than the fees we receive under a direct franchising model. Master franchise agreements, which are individually negotiated and vary among our brands, typically contain provisions that permit us to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to meet specified development schedules.
Strategies
Our strategy is to grow our profitability and create long-term shareholder value by:

• | attracting, retaining and developing franchisees;


• | “elevating the economy experience”;


• | expanding our presence in the midscale space and beyond; and


• | growing our footprint in the new and existing international markets

Seasonality
Franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters of any calendar year. This is due to increased leisure travel and the related ability to charge higher ADRs during these months.
Competition 
We encounter competition among hotel franchisors and lodging operators. We believe franchisees make decisions based principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand and the services offered. We further believe that the perceived value of a brand name is partially a function of the success of the existing hotels franchised under the brand.
The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be affected by the location and quality of its property, the number of competitors in the vicinity, community reputation and other factors. A franchisee’s success may also be affected by general, regional and local economic conditions. The potential negative effect of these conditions on our performance is substantially reduced by virtue of the diverse locations of our franchised hotels and by the scale of our franchisee base. Our franchise system is dispersed among 5,727 franchisees, which reduces our exposure to any one franchisee. Our three master franchisors in China account for 16% of our franchised hotels. Apart from these relationships, no one franchisee accounts for more than 1% of our franchised hotels.
WYNDHAM DESTINATION NETWORK
Industry
A large segment of leisure travel is delivered through non-hotel accommodations that include vacation ownership exchange and vacation rentals. These non-hotel accommodations provide leisure travelers access to a wide variety of leisure options that include vacation ownership resorts, privately-owned vacation homes, apartments and condominiums.
Vacation exchange is a fee-for-service industry that offers services and products to timeshare developers and owners. To participate in a vacation exchange, a timeshare owner deposits his or her interval from a resort or points from his or her club into a vacation exchange company’s network and receives the opportunity to use another owner’s interval at a different destination. The vacation exchange company assigns a value to the owner’s deposit based upon a number of factors, including supply and demand for the destination, size of the timeshare unit, dates of the interval and the amenities at the resort. Vacation exchange companies generally derive revenues by charging fees for facilitating vacation exchanges and through annual membership dues. In 2016, 30% of global timeshare owners (or 6.1 million) were vacation exchange members, and they completed approximately 2.8 million vacation exchanges. 
Vacation ownership clubs, such as Club Wyndham Plus, WorldMark by Wyndham, Hilton Grand Vacations and Disney Vacation Club, give members the option to exchange both internally, within their collection of resorts, or externally through vacation exchange networks such as RCI. These types of clubs have been the largest driver of vacation ownership industry growth over the past several years. This long-term trend has a positive impact on the average number of members, but a negative effect on the number of vacation exchange transactions per member and revenue per member as members exchange more often within their club.

Wyndham Destination Network Overview
We operate the world’s largest vacation exchange network based on the number of members and are a leading provider of professionally managed vacation rentals in North America. Our mission is to send people on the vacation of their dreams and, during 2017, we sent approximately 7 million people to their desired destinations. Through our industry-leading tools, expertise and brands, we create connections between suppliers and guests to maximize supplier utilization and guest experience. We are largely a fee-for-service business with strong and predictable cash flows.
Our programs serve a member base of timeshare, fractional and whole-unit owners who want flexibility and variety in their travel plans each year. Through our collection of vacation exchange brands, we have approximately 3.9 million member families. We generally retain over 85% of our RCI members each year. In the vast majority of cases, we acquire new members when an affiliated timeshare developer pays for the initial term of a membership on behalf of a timeshare owner as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. Generally, this initial membership is for either a 1 or 2 year term, after which these new members may choose to renew directly with us. We also acquire a small percentage of new members directly from online channels. Club and corporate members receive the benefit of our vacation exchange program as part of their ownership with enrollment and renewals paid for by the developer. Members receive periodicals published by us and, for additional fees, use the applicable vacation exchange program and other services that provide members the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of a deposit, combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power, and book travel services. 
Our vacation exchange business has relationships with over 4,300 vacation ownership resorts in 110 countries and territories, located in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. We tailor our strategies and operating plans for each region where we have, or seek to develop, a substantial member base.
Our vacation exchange business derives the majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and fees for facilitating vacation exchanges and rentals. We also generate revenue from: (i) additional services, programs with affiliated resorts, club servicing and loyalty programs and (ii) additional products that provide members the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of deposits, and combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power. No one customer, developer or group accounts for more than 8% of our revenues.
Performance in our vacation exchange business is measured by the following key operating statistics:

• | Average number of members - Represents members in our vacation exchange programs who paid annual membership dues as of the end of the period or within the allowed grace period.


• | Exchange revenue per member - Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.

We also derive revenues from our North American vacation rentals business from (i) commissions earned on the rental of vacation rental properties on behalf of independent owners and (ii) additional property management services delivered to property owners, vacation rental guests and homeowners’ associations. 
Brands
We operate under the following brands:
RCI. Founded in 1974, RCI operates the world’s largest vacation ownership weeks-based vacation exchange network, RCI Weeks, and provides members with the ability to exchange week-long intervals in units at their home resort for intervals at comparable resorts. RCI also operates the world’s largest vacation ownership points-based vacation exchange network, RCI Points. This program allocates points to use rights that members cede to the vacation exchange program. Members may redeem their points for the use of vacation properties for the duration they chose in our vacation exchange program or for discounts on other services and products which may change from time to time, such as airfare, car rentals, cruises, hotels and other accommodations. When intervals are exchanged for these other services and products, RCI obtains the rights from that member’s deposits and may rent vacation properties in order to recoup the expense of providing these other services and products. RCI also offers enhanced membership tiers (Gold and Platinum), which provide additional benefits to weeks and points members.
14

The Registry Collection. Established in 2002, The Registry Collection vacation exchange program is the industry’s largest and first global vacation exchange network of luxury vacation accommodations. The luxury vacation accommodations in our network include fractional ownership resorts, higher-end vacation ownership resorts, condo-hotels and yachts. The Registry Collection Program allows members to exchange their intervals for the use of other luxury vacation properties within the network for a fee and also offers access to other services and products at member preferred rates, such as cruises, yachts, adventure travel, hotels and other accommodations.
DAE. Founded in 1997, DAE is a leading direct-to-consumer model of vacation exchange with global operations. This member-direct vacation exchange program is open to all timeshare owners, regardless of the resort where they own. DAE offers weeks, points and club owners a simple exchange system with modest support services so they can enjoy resort style accommodations around the world.
Love Home Swap. Founded in 2011, Love Home Swap provides homeowners two ways to turn their home into vacation opportunities. Members have the option to: (i) swap time at their home directly with another member for time at their property or (ii) swap time at their home for points, which can be used at a later date to secure a stay at another member’s home. Love Home Swap has developed a sizeable footprint in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and has begun to establish a presence in the United States and Australia. 
Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Wyndham Vacation Rentals offers North America-based rental properties in nearly 50 beach, ski, mountain, theme park, golf and tennis destinations such as Florida, South Carolina, Colorado, Delaware, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Utah, California and British Columbia. It has more than 35 years of industry experience providing vacation rentals to travelers through recognized and established brands such as ResortQuest, Steamboat Resorts and Smoky Mountain Property Management.
Inventory
The properties our business makes available to travelers include vacation ownership condominiums, fractional resorts, homes, yachts, private residence clubs and traditional hotel rooms. We offer travelers flexibility as to time of travel and a choice of lodging options. This flexibility also helps our affiliated resorts as it provides additional benefit to the vacation ownership product. We offer property owners marketing, booking, property management and quality control services.
We leverage inventory (Vacation Ownership Interests or VOIs and independently owned properties) across our network of brands to maximize value for affiliates, vacation exchange members, vacation rental property owners and guests. We also leverage our scale and global marketing expertise to enhance demand and drive occupancy across our network of destinations, including the ability to source vacation rental inventory for vacation exchange members.
We also provide industry-leading technology and revenue management expertise to optimize our network of destination inventory through automated tools and sophisticated yield management techniques and to provide inventory distribution to our network of affiliated resorts. Additionally, we have adapted our yield management technology to introduce a new vacation rental property recruiting tool and have implemented the tool throughout our North American vacation rental operations.
Customer Development
We affiliate with vacation ownership developers directly through our in-house sales teams. Affiliated developers sign agreements that have an average duration of approximately five years. Our members are acquired primarily through our affiliated developers as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. We also acquire a small percentage of our members directly from online channels.
At our vacation rental brands, we primarily enter into exclusive annual rental agreements with property owners. We market these rental properties online and offline to large databases of customers. Additional customers are sourced through transactional websites and offline advertising and promotions, and through the use of third-party travel agencies, tour operators and online distribution channels to drive additional occupancy. We have a number of specific branded websites to promote, sell and inform new customers about vacation rentals.
Loyalty Program
RCI’s loyalty program, RCI Elite Rewards, offers a co-branded credit card to our members. The card allows members to earn reward points that can be redeemed for items related to our vacation exchange programs, including annual membership dues, exchange fees for transactions, and other services and products offered by RCI or certain third parties, including airlines and retailers.
15

Our vacation rental brands also participate in the industry’s leading loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. During 2017, we made approximately 7,000 vacation rental properties available for redemption through Wyndham Rewards and will continue incorporating properties into the program in the years to come. We expect Wyndham Rewards to increase awareness of our vacation rental brands and drive incremental revenue.
Distribution
We distribute our products and services through proprietary websites and call centers around the world. We invest in new technologies and online capabilities to ensure that our customers have the best experience and access to consistent information and services across digital and call center channels. We continue to enhance our digital channels, mobile capabilities and e-commerce platforms across our network.
Important technology enhancements include streamlined search and transaction journeys, improved help and mobile functionality, more robust redesigned website content, and personalized content and offers for our customers. Recognizing that today’s on-the-go customer relies on mobile devices more frequently than ever before, we are further investing in our mobile apps and mobile browsers based on the latest technologies coupled with a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior. We have incorporated new tools and responsive designs that take advantage of the portability and variability of mobile devices, allowing customers to research and plan activities, going beyond the travel booking transaction alone.
Part of our vacation rental strategy has been to enhance and expand our online distribution channels, including global partnerships with several industry-leading online travel and vacation rental portals in order to streamline inventory connectivity and guest experience. This will continue to accelerate revenue growth and allow for more business on the web instead of through our call centers, thus generating cost savings for us.
The requests we receive at our global call centers are handled by our vacation guides, who are trained to fulfill requests for vacation exchanges and rentals. Call centers remain an important distribution channel for us and therefore we continue to invest resources to ensure that members and rental customers receive a high level of personalized customer service. Through our call centers, we also provide private-labeled reservation booking, customer care and other services for our RCI affiliates.
Marketing
We market our services and products to our customers using our six primary consumer brands and other related brands in more than 130 offices worldwide through several marketing channels including direct mail, email, social media, telemarketing, online distribution channels, brochures and magazines. Our core marketing strategy is to personalize and customize our marketing to best match customer preferences. We have a comprehensive social and mobile media platform including apps for smartphones and tablets, Facebook and Pinterest fan pages, several Twitter and Instagram accounts and YouTube channels, online video content, and various online magazines. We use our various resort directories and periodicals related to the vacation industry for marketing as well as for member retention and loyalty. Additionally, we promote our offerings to owners of resorts and vacation homes through trade shows, online and other marketing channels that include direct mail and telemarketing.
Strategies
Our strategy is to grow our profitability and create long-term shareholder value by:

• | leveraging our exchange platform and expertise to expand into new membership models and offerings;


• | investing in technology to personalize and improve the customer experience and maximize retention;


• | utilizing analytics to maximize yield and improve key business processes across our portfolio; and


• | promoting the benefits of vacation ownership to new and existing customer segments.

Our plans generally focus on pursuing these strategies organically. However, in appropriate circumstances, we will consider opportunities to acquire businesses, both domestic and international.
Seasonality
Our revenues from vacation exchange fees have traditionally been higher in the first quarter, which is generally when our vacation exchange members plan and book their vacations for the year. Revenues from vacation rentals have traditionally been highest in the third quarter, when vacation arrivals are highest.
Competition
Wyndham Destination Network competes globally with other vacation exchange companies and certain developers and clubs that offer vacation exchanges through their own internal networks of properties. Our vacation exchange business also 
16

competes with third-party Internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks that are used by consumers to search for and book their resort and other travel accommodations. Our vacation rental brands face competition from a broad variety of professional vacation rental managers, most of which are small regional operators and individual property owners who pursue the rent-by-owner model, collectively using brokerage services, direct marketing and the internet to market and rent their vacation properties.
WYNDHAM VACATION OWNERSHIP
Vacation Ownership (Timeshare) Industry
The vacation ownership industry, also referred to as the timeshare industry, enables consumers to share ownership of a fully-furnished vacation accommodation. Typically, the consumer purchases either a title to a fraction of a unit or a right to use a property for a specific period of time. This is referred to as a Vacation Ownership Interest or VOI. For many purchasers, vacation ownership is an attractive alternative to traditional lodging accommodations at hotels. Unlike hotel customers, timeshare owners are immune to variability in room rates. Also, vacation ownership units are, on average, more than twice the size and typically have more amenities than traditional hotel rooms, such as kitchens or in-unit laundry.
VOIs are generally sold through weekly intervals or points-based systems. Under the weekly intervals system, owners can use a specific unit at a specific resort often during a specific week of the year. Under the points-based system, owners often have advance reservation rights for a particular destination, but are free to redeem their points for various unit types and/or locations. In addition, points owners can vary the length and frequency of product utilization. Once point values are established for particular units, they generally cannot be changed, ensuring that the value of owner’s points never diminishes. According to the American Resort Development Association (or “ARDA”, a trade association representing the vacation ownership and resort development industries) industry-wide sales were divided 71% for points-based systems and 29% for weekly intervals in 2016.
The vacation ownership concept originated in Europe during the late 1960s and spread to the United States shortly thereafter. The industry expanded slowly in the United States until the mid-1980s. From the mid-1980s through 2007, it grew at a double-digit rate. Sales declined by approximately 8% in 2008 and experienced even greater declines in 2009 due to the global recession and a significant disruption in the credit markets. More recently, according to a 2017 report issued by ARDA, domestic vacation ownership sales were approximately $9.2 billion in 2016, compared to $8.6 billion in 2015.
While a secondary resale market for VOIs exists, it is fragmented and lacks specific regulation. In addition, owners who purchase on the secondary market typically do not receive all of the benefits that owners who purchase directly from a developer receive.
Based on published industry data, the primary reasons owners have expressed for buying and continuing to own their timeshare are as follows:
•saving money on future vacation costs;
•location of resorts;
•overall flexibility by allowing them the ability to use different locations, unit types and times of year;
•the certainty of vacations; and
•the certainty of quality accommodations. 
Demographic factors explain, in part, the continued appeal of vacation ownership. A 2016 study of recent U.S. vacation ownership purchasers indicated that the average timeshare owner is 47 years old and has an average annual household income of $93,000. Nearly half of the respondents indicated they plan to buy or upgrade a timeshare over the next two years. This, along with other industry data, suggests that the typical purchaser in the United States has disposable income and is interested in purchasing vacation products. Although we believe baby boomers will continue to be active participants in the vacation ownership industry, this study notes that 41% of the respondents were Gen X’ers and 26% were Millennials and that the average age of new first-time purchasers was 43 years old with an average household income of $88,000. The data also suggests that perception of the industry and primary reasons for buying their timeshare voiced by Millennials are similar to the overall population of owners but with them seeking even more flexibility in using and accessing the product. Most owners can exchange their timeshare unit through exchange companies, and through the applicable vacation ownership company’s internal network of properties.

Wyndham Vacation Ownership Overview
Wyndham Vacation Ownership is the largest vacation ownership business in the world as measured by revenues and the number of vacation ownership resorts, units and owners. We develop and acquire vacation ownership resorts, market and sell VOIs, provide consumer financing for the majority of the sales, and provide property management services to property owners’ associations. As of December 31, 2017, we had 221 vacation ownership resorts in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and the South Pacific that represent approximately 25,000 individual vacation ownership units and over 878,000 owners of VOIs.
Our brands operate points-based vacation ownership programs through which VOIs can be redeemed for vacations that provide owners with flexibility as to resort location, length of stay, number of stays, unit type, and time of year. Our programs allow us to market and sell our vacation ownership products in variable quantities and to offer existing owners “upgrade” sales to supplement such owners’ existing VOIs. This contrasts with the fixed quantity of the traditional fixed-week vacation ownership, which is primarily sold on a weekly interval basis. Less than 1% of our VOI sales are from traditional fixed-week vacation ownership sales.
Although we operate separate brands, we have integrated substantially all of the business functions, including consumer finance, information technology, staff functions, product development and marketing activities.
Revenues
Our vacation ownership business derives a majority of its revenues from timeshare sales, with the remainder coming from consumer financing and property management. Property management revenues are partly dependent on the number of units we manage.
Operating Statistics
Wyndham Vacation Ownership’s performance is measured by the following key operating statistics:

• | Gross vacation ownership interest sales or VOIs - Represents sales of VOIs including WAAM sales before the net effect of percentage-of-completion (“POC”) accounting and loan loss provisions.


• | Tours - Represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell VOIs.


• | Volume per guest or VPG - Represents gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. We have excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour upgrade sales are generated by a different marketing channel.

Our Vacation Ownership Brands
Club Wyndham
As of December 31, 2017, resort properties branded as Club Wyndham consisted of 100 resorts (22 of which are shared with WorldMark by Wyndham, two of which are shared with Wyndham Vacation Resorts Asia Pacific and one of which is shared with Shell) primarily located in the United States and included over 14,000 units. As of such date, approximately 509,000 owners held Club Wyndham VOIs.
WorldMark by Wyndham
WorldMark by Wyndham is a club consisting of 93 resorts (22 of which are shared with Club Wyndham, one of which is shared with Wyndham Vacation Resorts Asia Pacific and one of which is shared with Shell) and representing over 7,100 units which are located primarily in the Western United States, Canada and Mexico. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 227,000 owners held vacation credits in the club. The resorts in which WorldMark by Wyndham markets and sells vacation credits are primarily drive-to resorts.
Wyndham Vacation Resorts Asia Pacific
As of December 31, 2017, over 56,000 owners held vacation credits for Wyndham Vacation Resorts Asia Pacific, which consists of 30 resorts (one of which is shared with WorldMark by Wyndham and two of which are shared with Club Wyndham) representing approximately 1,500 units that are located exclusively in the South Pacific.
18

Shell Vacations Club
Shell Vacations Club consists of 25 resorts (one of which is shared with Club Wyndham and one of which is shared with WorldMark by Wyndham) representing over 2,200 units which are primarily located in Hawaii, California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, Oregon, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Canada. As of December 31, 2017, over 86,000 owners held vacation points in the Shell Vacations Club.
Maintenance Fees
Timeshare owners pay annual maintenance fees to the property owners’ associations responsible for managing the applicable resorts or to the Clubs. The annual maintenance fee associated with the average VOIs purchased ranges from approximately $400 to $1,000. These fees are used to renovate and replace furnishings, pay for management, operating, maintenance, cleaning and insurance costs, cover taxes in some states, and pay for other related costs. As the owner of unsold inventory at resorts or unsold interests in the Clubs, we also pay maintenance fees in accordance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions in which the resorts are located. In addition, at certain newly-developed resorts, we sometimes enter into subsidy agreements with the property owners’ associations to cover costs that otherwise would be covered by annual maintenance fees payable with respect to VOIs that have not yet been sold.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a variety of marketing channels to encourage prospective owners of VOIs to tour our properties and attend sales presentations at off-site sales offices. Our resort-based sales centers also enable us to actively solicit upgrade sales to existing owners of VOIs while they vacation at our resort properties. We also operate a tele-sales program designed to market upgrade sales to existing owners of our products. Sales of VOIs relating to upgrades represented approximately 64%, 67%, and 68% of our net VOI sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We use a variety of marketing programs to attract prospective owners, including sponsored contests that offer vacation packages or gifts, targeted mailings, outbound and inbound telemarketing efforts, and in association with Wyndham Hotel Group brands, other co-branded marketing programs and events. We also partner with Wyndham Hotel Group by utilizing the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program to offer Wyndham Rewards points as an incentive to prospective VOI purchasers, and by providing additional redemption options to Wyndham Rewards members. We also co-sponsor sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional programs with professional teams at major sporting events and with other third parties at other high-traffic consumer events. Where permissible under state law, we offer cash awards or other incentives to existing owners for referrals of new owners.
New owner acquisition is an important strategy for us as this will continue to maintain our pool of “lifetime” buyers of vacation ownership and thus enable us to solicit upgrade sales in the future. We believe the market for VOI sales is under-penetrated, and estimate that there are 53 million U.S. households that are potential purchasers of VOIs. We added approximately 36,000, 33,000 and 30,000 new owners during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our marketing and sales activities are often facilitated through marketing alliances with other travel, hospitality, entertainment, gaming and retail companies that provide access to such companies’ customers through a variety of co-branded marketing offers. Our resort-based sales centers, which are located in popular travel destinations throughout the United States, generate substantial tour flow by enabling us to market to tourists already visiting these destination areas. Our marketing agents, who often operate on the premises of the hospitality, entertainment, gaming and retail companies with which we have alliances, solicit tourists with offers relating to entertainment activities and other incentives in exchange for the tourists visiting the local resorts and attending sales presentations.
An example of a marketing alliance through which we market to tourists visiting destination areas is our current arrangement with Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas, Nevada. This arrangement enables us to operate concierge-style marketing kiosks throughout select casinos and permits us to solicit patrons to attend sales presentations with casino-related rewards and entertainment offers, such as gaming chips, show tickets and dining certificates. We also operate our primary Las Vegas sales center within Harrah’s Casino and regularly shuttle prospective owners targeted by such sales centers to and from our nearby resort property.
Other marketing alliances provide us with the opportunity to align our marketing and sales programs with well-known lifestyle brands that appeal to consumers with similar demographics to our current purchasers. One such example is our alliance with Margaritaville, a lifestyle brand popularized by musician/entertainer Jimmy Buffett, where we market to patrons of various Margaritaville product lines via multiple channels, including on-site marketing at Margaritaville restaurants, affiliated venues and events, as well as co-branded vacation ownership offerings.

We offer a variety of entry-level programs and products as part of our sales strategy. For example, we have a program that allows prospective owners a one-time allotment of points or credits with no further obligations, which we refer to as our sampler program, and a biennial product that provides for vacations every other year. As part of our sales strategies, we rely on our points/credits-based programs, which provide prospective owners with the flexibility to buy relatively small packages of points or credits which can then be upgraded at a later date. To facilitate upgrade sales among existing owners, we market opportunities for owners to purchase additional points or credits through periodic marketing campaigns and promotions while those owners vacation at our resort properties.
Purchaser Financing
We offer financing to purchasers of VOIs which attracts additional customers and generates substantial incremental revenues and profits. We fund and service loans extended by Club Wyndham and WorldMark by Wyndham through our consumer financing subsidiary, Wyndham Consumer Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wyndham Vacation Resorts based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Wyndham Consumer Finance performs loan financing, servicing and related administrative functions. We have funded Shell Vacations Club loans since the date of acquisition through our consumer finance subsidiary, and service them through a third-party.
We typically perform a credit investigation or other inquiry into every purchaser’s credit history before offering to finance a portion of the purchase price of the VOIs. The interest rate offered to participating purchasers is determined by an automated underwriting process based upon the purchaser’s credit score, the amount of the down payment, and the size of purchase. We use a FICO score which is a branded version of a consumer credit score widely used within the United States by the largest banks and lending institutions. FICO scores range from 300 to 850 and are calculated based on information obtained from one or more of the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies that compile and report on a consumer’s credit history. For purchasers with large loan balances, we maintain higher credit standards for new loan originations. Our weighted average FICO score on new originations was 726, 727 and 725 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During 2017, we generated approximately $1.4 billion of new receivables on $2.1 billion of gross vacation ownership sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales, resulting in 66% of our vacation ownership sales being financed. This level of financing is prior to the receipt of addenda cash. Addenda cash represents the cash received for full payment of a loan within 15 to 60 days of origination. After the application of addenda cash, we financed approximately 58% of vacation ownership sales during 2017.
We generally require a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price on all sales of VOIs and offer consumer financing for the remaining balance for up to 10 years. While the minimum is generally 10%, during 2017 and 2016, our average down payment on financed sales of VOIs was approximately 24% and 25% during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease is attributable to lower down payment requirements to support our strategy to grow new members. These loans are structured with equal monthly installments that fully amortize the principal by the final due date.
Similar to many other companies that provide consumer financing, we have historically securitized a majority of the receivables originated in connection with the sales of VOIs. We initially place the financed contracts into a revolving warehouse securitization facility, generally within 30 to 90 days after origination. Many of the receivables are subsequently transferred from the warehouse securitization facility and placed into term securitization facilities.
Our consumer financing subsidiary is responsible for the maintenance of contract receivables files as well as all customer service, billing and collection activities related to the domestic loans we extend (except for loans associated with Shell Vacations Club). We assess the performance of our loan portfolio by monitoring numerous metrics including collections rates, defaults by state of residency and bankruptcies. Our consumer financing subsidiary also manages the selection and processing of loans pledged or to be pledged in our warehouse and term securitization facilities. As of December 31, 2017, 95% of our loan portfolio was current (i.e., not more than 30 days past due).
Property Management
On behalf of each of the property owners’ associations, we or our affiliates generally provide day-to-day management for vacation ownership resorts, which includes oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance and refurbishment of the units, and provides certain accounting and administrative services to property owners’ associations. The terms of the property management agreements are generally between 3 to 5 years; however, the vast majority of the agreements provide a mechanism for automatic renewal upon expiration of the terms. In connection with these property management services, we

receive fees which are generally based upon total costs to operate such resorts. Fees for property management services typically approximate 10% of budgeted operating expenses.
Inventory Sourcing
We sell inventory sourced primarily through four channels:
•self-developed inventory,

• | WAAM,


• | consumer loan defaults, and


• | inventory reclaimed from owners’ associations or owners.

Following are descriptions of these inventory sources:
Self-developed inventory. Under the traditional timeshare industry development model, we finance and develop inventory specifically for our timeshare sales. The process often begins with the purchase of raw land which we then develop. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, this process can take several years. Such inventory can include mixed-use inventory developed in conjunction with one of our hotel brands, where a portion of the property is devoted to the timeshare product.
WAAM. In 2010, we introduced the first of our WAAM models, WAAM Fee-for Service. This timeshare sourcing model was designed to capitalize upon the large quantities of newly developed, nearly completed or recently finished condominium or hotel inventory in the real estate market without assuming the significant risk that accompanies property acquisition or new construction. This business model offers turn-key solutions for developers or banks in possession of newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our extensive sales and marketing channels. WAAM Fee-for-Service enables us to expand our resort portfolio with little or no capital deployment, while providing additional channels for new owner acquisition and growth for our fee-for-service property management business.
In addition to the WAAM Fee-for-Service business model, we utilize our WAAM Just-in-Time inventory acquisition model. This model enables us to acquire and own completed units close to the timing of their sale or to acquire completed inventory from a third-party partner based upon a predetermined purchase schedule. This model significantly reduces the period between the deployment of capital to acquire inventory and the subsequent return on investment which occurs at the time of its sale to a timeshare purchaser. For the most part, inventory is recorded on our balance sheet at the time we are committed to purchase such inventory, which generally coincides with the time of registration.
Consumer loan defaults. As discussed in the “Purchaser Financing” section, we offer financing to purchasers of VOIs. In the event of a default, we are able to recover the inventory and resell it at full current value. We are responsible for the payment of maintenance fees to the property owners’ associations until the product is sold. As of December 31, 2017, inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included estimated recoveries of loan defaults in the amount of $279 million.
Inventory reclaimed from owners’ associations or owners. We have entered into agreements with a majority of the property associations representing our developments where we may acquire from the associations, properties related to owners who have defaulted on their maintenance fees, provided there is no outstanding debt on such properties. In addition, we frequently work with owners to acquire their properties, provided they have no outstanding debt on such properties, prior to those owners defaulting on their maintenance fees. This provides the owner with a graceful exit from a property that is no longer utilized due to lifestyle changes.
Strategies
Our strategy is to grow our profitability and create long-term shareholder value by:

• | adding new members efficiently through new inventory locations, new tour sources and enhanced third-party alliances;


• | driving free cash flow through efficient inventory procurement, optimizing our consumer loan portfolio and increasing operating efficiencies; and


• | increasing cross-business benefits, new owner tours and customer loyalty by leveraging the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program.

Seasonality
We rely, in part, upon tour flow to generate sales of VOIs; consequently, sales volume tends to increase in the spring and summer months as a result of greater tour flow from spring and summer travelers. Therefore, revenues from sales of VOIs are generally higher in the third quarter than in other quarters. 
Competition
The vacation ownership industry is highly competitive and is comprised of a number of companies specializing primarily in sales and marketing, consumer financing, property management and development of vacation ownership properties.
TRADEMARKS
Our brand names and related trademarks, service marks, logos and trade names are critical to the businesses that make up our Wyndham Hotel Group, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Vacation Ownership business units. Our subsidiaries actively use or license for use all significant marks, and we own or have exclusive licenses to use these marks. We register the marks that we own in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with other relevant authorities where we deem appropriate, and seek to protect our marks from unauthorized use as permitted by law.
EMPLOYEES 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 39,200 employees, including approximately 11,000 employees outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our hotel group business had over 8,700 employees, our destination network business had over 11,200 employees, our vacation ownership business had over 18,700 employees and our corporate group had over 600 employees. Approximately 9% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our compliance with laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future.
SUSTAINABILITY
We are committed to being at the forefront of sustainable business practices and we continue to work toward meeting all corporate social responsibility regulations in areas where we do business. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce our carbon emissions by 25% at our owned, managed and leased assets (based on square foot intensity) compared to 2010, which we use as our baseline. During 2016, we surpassed our goal and reduced our carbon emissions by 33% compared to 2010. We have increased our goal to reduce our carbon emissions by 40% and water consumption by 25% by the year 2025 (based on square foot intensity) compared to 2010. We will maintain our goal to ensure that 30% of our qualified supply chain spend is with suppliers who meet our Wyndham Green criteria by 2020. As of December 31, 2016, 27% of suppliers were considered to be in alignment with Wyndham’s sustainability initiatives. In 2017, we exceeded our goal to plant one million trees which has helped us to improve our biodiversity footprint.
