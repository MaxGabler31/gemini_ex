Overview and Strategy
 XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), a Delaware corporation, has a long history of discovering and developing innovative therapeutics derived from its unique platform of antibody technologies. Over our 37 year history, we built an extensive portfolio of fully-funded programs by advancing product candidates into the earlier stages of development and then licensing them to licensees who assumed the responsibilities of later stage development, approval and commercialization. Fully-funded programs are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. As licensees advance these programs, we are eligible for potential milestone and royalty payments.     
 In March 2017, we transformed our business model to become a royalty aggregator where we focus on expanding our portfolio of fully-funded programs by out-licensing our internally developed product candidates and acquiring potential milestone and royalty revenue streams on additional product candidates. We combined our royalty-aggregator model with a significantly reduced corporate cost structure to further build value for our shareholders. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. 
 
Our business model is designed to create value for stockholders by assembling a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical revenue streams and operating that business with an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to become a sustainably profitable company that offers investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a diversified, lower-risk business investment than a typical biotech model. The following charts demonstrate the diversification of our fully-funded asset portfolio across therapeutic areas and development stages. 
 1


In 2017, we added nine new programs to our fully-funded asset portfolio by out-licensing two of our internally developed product candidates, adding three new phage display licensees and adding four new potential royalty streams through our license agreements with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) and Rezolute, Inc. (formerly AntriaBio, Inc.) (“Rezolute”). 
 Organization
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation. When referring to a time or period before December 31, 1998 or after December 31, 2011, the terms “Company” and “XOMA” refer to XOMA Corporation, a Delaware corporation; when referring to a time or period between December 31, 1998 and December 31, 2011, such terms refer to XOMA Ltd., a Bermuda company.
Our principal executive offices are located at 2200 Powell Street, Suite 310, Emeryville, California 94608, and we maintain a registered office located at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801. Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is (510) 204-7200. Our website address is www.xoma.com. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
Licensing and Collaboration Agreements Underlying Our Fully-Funded Program Portfolio
 Historically, we have licensed or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, such as Novartis in pursuit of new antibody products under which we are eligible to receive potential future milestone payments and royalties. The following is a summary of license and collaboration agreements that represent a significant component of our fully-funded program portfolio. 
Novartis - IL-1
 In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into a license agreement (the “IL-1 Target License Agreement”), under which we granted Novartis non-exclusive licenses to our intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and other diseases and conditions and an option to obtain an exclusive license (the “Exclusivity Option”) to such intellectual property for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. We also granted Novartis the right of first negotiation with respect to certain transactions relating to the licensed intellectual property.  
 2


Under the IL-1 Target License Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on canakinumab sales in cardiovascular indications. If Novartis exercises the Exclusivity Option, the royalties on canakinumab sales will increase to the mid-single digits. In November 2017, Novartis announced it intends to submit data from its canakinumab Phase 3 trial in cardiovascular treatment for regulatory approval. 
Novartis – Gevokizumab 
 In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into a license agreement (the “XOMA-052 License Agreement”) under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab (an early clinical stage product candidate) and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the XOMA-052 License Agreement, Novartis will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of gevokizumab and products containing the antibody. 
 Under the XOMA-052 License Agreement, we received total consideration of $30.0 million for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, $15.7 million was paid in cash and $14.3 million (equal to €12.0 million) was paid by Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. (“NIBR”), on our behalf, to settle our loan with Les Laboratories Servier (“Servier”). In addition, NIBR extended the maturity date on our debt to Novartis to September 30, 2022. We also received $5.0 million related to the sale of 539,131 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $9.2742. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $438.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a high single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate. 
 Novartis – Anti-TGFβ Antibody
 In September 2015, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (“Novartis International”) entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which we granted Novartis International an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGF-β antibody program. Novartis International is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. 
 Under the License Agreement, we received a $37.0 million upfront fee, and are eligible to receive up to a total of $480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate. This program is currently in early clinical testing.
 Novartis – Anti-CD40 Antibody
 In September 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (“NVDI”), further amended our 2008 Amended and Restated Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement, relating to anti-CD40 antibodies. Under this agreement, NVDI is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. The parties agreed to reduce the royalty rates that we are eligible to receive on sales of NVDI’s clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies. These royalties are tiered based on sales levels and now range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate.
 In November 2017, Novartis presented the results of a Phase 2a study in Sjögren’s syndrome at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. Our right to royalty payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the first commercial sale of each product.
 Rezolute 
 On December 6, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Rezolute pursuant to which we granted an exclusive global license to Rezolute to develop and commercialize X358 (now RZ358), a Phase 2 product candidate, for all indications. We and Rezolute also entered into a common stock purchase agreement.
 3


Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is responsible for all development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities associated with RZ358 and is required to make certain clinical, regulatory and annual net sales milestone payments to us of up to $232.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria. Rezolute is also obligated to pay us royalties ranging from the high single digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of RZ358. Rezolute is obligated to take customary steps to advance RZ358, including using diligent efforts to commence the next clinical study for RZ358 by a certain deadline and to meet certain spending requirements on an annual basis for the program until a marketing approval application for RZ358 is accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular RZ358 product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country.
Pursuant to the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute is required to pay us $6.0 million in cash and to issue us $12.0 million worth of its common stock, contingent on the completion of its financing activities. Further, in the event that Rezolute does not complete a financing that raises at least $20.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds (“Qualified Financing”) by March 31, 2019, it shall issue to us an additional number of shares of its common stock equal to $7.0 million divided by the weighted average of the closing bid and asked prices or the average closing prices of Rezolute’s common stock on the ten-day trading period prior to March 31, 2019. Finally, if Rezolute is unable to complete a Qualified Financing by March 31, 2020, it will be obliged to pay us $15.0 million in order to maintain the license. Under the common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute granted us the right and option to sell the greater of (i) 5,000,000 shares of common stock or (ii) one third of the aggregate shares held by us upon failure by Rezolute to list its shares of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar national exchange on or prior to December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we have not received any cash or common stock from Rezolute as they have not completed any financing or other activities outlined in the agreement.
 In addition, under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is required to pay us a low single-digit royalty on sales of Rezolute’s other products from its existing programs, currently in preclinical and early clinical stages. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular Rezolute product and country will continue for the longer of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or for so long as Rezolute or its licensee is selling such product in such country, provided that such royalty will terminate upon the termination of the licensee’s obligation to make payments to Rezolute based on sales of such product in such country. 
 We also granted Rezolute an option through June 1, 2019 for an exclusive license for their choice of one of our preclinical insulin receptor monoclonal antibody fragments, including X129. If Rezolute exercises the option, we will be eligible for an upfront option fee and additional clinical, regulatory and annual net sales milestone payments to us of up to $237.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria as well as royalties ranging from a high single digit percentage rate to a low double-digit percentage rate based on annual net sales. The license agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Rezolute also has a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety on ninety-days’ notice at any time. We have the right to terminate the license agreement if Rezolute challenges the licensed patents.
 Ology Bioservices
 
On November 4, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ology Bioservices, Inc. (“Ology Bioservices”) (formerly Nanotherapeutics Inc.) (the “Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement”), under which Ology Bioservices agreed to acquire our biodefense business and related assets. Under the terms of this agreement, we are eligible to receive a 15% royalty on net sales of any future Ology Bioservices products covered by or involving the related patents or know-how. Further details of the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement are provided in the section below, “Sale of Biodefense Assets and Manufacturing Facility.”
Proprietary Product Candidates
 We have a portfolio of unique monoclonal antibodies and technologies that we intend to license to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further their clinical development. A summary of these product candidates is provided below:

• | X213 (formerly LFA 102) is a first-in-class allosteric inhibitor of prolactin action. It is a humanized IgG1-Kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor with high affinity at an allosteric site. The antibody has been shown to inhibit prolactin-mediated signaling, and it is potent and similarly active against several animal and human prolactin receptors. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement with PRLA Pharma, Inc. (“PrlA”) pursuant to which we granted PrlA an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize X213, contingent on PrlA obtaining a specified level of financing. In the event PrlA does not obtain adequate financing within the specified period, X213 will be returned to us.

• | XMetA is an insulin receptor-activating antibody designed to provide long-acting reduction of hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients, potentially reducing the advancement to a number of insulin injections needed to control their blood glucose levels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additional Preclinical Product Candidates: In November 2016, we unveiled two novel oncology and oncology-related preclinical product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The first targets interleukin 2, (“IL-2”), which has long been recognized as an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, but it has serious dose-limiting toxicities that prevent broad clinical use. We have generated novel antibodies that, when given with IL-2, are intended to steer IL-2 to enhance its positive impact with less toxicity, potentially improving the therapeutic index over standard IL-2 therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The other is an anti-parathyroid receptor (“PTH1R”) portfolio that includes several unique functional antibody antagonists targeting PTH1R, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism. These antibodies have shown promising efficacy in in vivo studies and could potentially address unmet medical needs, including primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (“HHM”). HHM is present in many advanced cancers and is caused by high serum calcium due to increased levels of the PTH1R ligand PTH-related peptide (“PTHrP”). Current HHM treatments often fall short and many cancer patients die from ‘metabolic death'. Our PTH1R antibodies could be beneficial for the treatment of HHM.

 Technologies Available for Non-Exclusive License
 We have a unique set of antibody discovery, optimization and development technologies available for licensing, including:
  
• | ADAPT™ (Antibody Discovery Advanced Platform Technologies): proprietary human antibody phage display libraries, integrated with yeast and mammalian display, which can be integrated into antibody discovery programs through license agreements. We believe access to ADAPT™ Integrated Display offers a number of benefits because it enables the diversity of phage libraries to be combined with accelerated discovery due to rapid immunoglobulin (“IgG”) reformatting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting based screening using yeast and mammalian display. This increases the probability of success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ModulX™: technology which allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways, homeostatic control, and disease biology. Using ModulX™, we have generated product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents (e.g. receptor-ligand). ModulX™ technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OptimX™ technologies:
--+----------------------


• | Human Engineering™ (“HE™”): a proprietary humanization technology that allows modification of non-human monoclonal antibodies to reduce or eliminate detectable immunogenicity and make them suitable for medical purposes in humans. The technology uses a unique method developed by us, based on analysis of the conserved structure-function relationships among antibodies. The method defines which residues in a non-human variable region are candidates to be modified. The result is an HE™ antibody with preserved antigen binding, structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity. HE™ technology was used in development of gevokizumab and certain other antibody products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted Affinity Enhancement™ (“TAE™”): a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity. TAE™ generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the complementarity-determining region likely to impact binding. The technology has been licensed to a number of companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible Manufacturing: patented technology relating to a flexible arrangement of mobile clean rooms (“MCRs”) within a manufacturing facility, with each MCR providing a portable, self-contained environment that allows for drug development. The facility design allows MCRs to connect easily and quickly to a central supply of utilities such as air, water, and electricity. This unique arrangement facilitates flexible manufacturing and eliminates change-over downtime. This translates into significantly reduced capital expenditures, production costs, and maintenance costs while offering meaningful time advantages over conventional manufacturing facilities. When MCRs are not in use, they can be easily moved to cleaning/refurbishing areas and prepared MCRs can be "plugged in" for manufacturing. The flexible manufacturing system can be applied to fields as diverse as pharmaceuticals, biologics, and electronics.

Sale of Biodefense Assets and Manufacturing Facility 
 Ology Bioservices
 On November 4, 2015, we entered the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement with Ology Bioservices, under which Ology Bioservices agreed to acquire our biodefense business and related assets (including, subject to regulatory approval, certain contracts with the U.S. government), and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA. As part of that transaction, the parties, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, entered into an intellectual property license agreement (the “Ology Bioservices License Agreement”), under which we agreed to license to Ology Bioservices certain intellectual property rights related to the purchased assets. Under the Ology Bioservices License Agreement, we were eligible for up to $4.5 million of cash payments and 23,008 shares of common stock of Ology Bioservices, based upon Ology Bioservices achieving certain specified future operational objectives. In February 2017, we executed an Amendment and Restatement to both the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement and Ology Bioservices License Agreement primarily to (i) remove the obligation to issue 23,008 shares of common stock of Ology Bioservices under the Ology Bioservices Purchase Agreement, and (ii) revise the payment schedule related to the timing of the $4.5 million cash payments due to us under the Ology Bioservices License Agreement. Of the $4.5 million, $3.0 million was contingent upon Ology Bioservices achieving certain specified future operating objectives. In the first quarter of 2017, we were entitled to receive $1.6 million under the agreement in quarterly payments through September 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, Ology Bioservices achieved the specified operating objectives and we earned the $3.0 million milestone payment that we are entitled to receive in monthly payments through July 2018. Of the total $4.6 million owed to us, we received $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 which was recognized as other income in our consolidated statement of operations.
 In addition, we are eligible to receive a 15% royalty on net sales of any future Ology Bioservices products covered by or involving the related patents or know-how. Our right to royalties continues until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. 
 Agenus
 On November 5, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agenus Purchase Agreement”) with Agenus West, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc. (“Agenus”), pursuant to which Agenus agreed to acquire our pilot scale manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California, together with certain related assets, including a license to certain intellectual property related to the purchased assets, and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA, in consideration for the payment to us of up to $5.0 million in cash and the issuance to us of shares of Agenus’s common stock having an aggregate value of up to $1.0 million. The Agenus Purchase Agreement closed on December 31, 2015. At closing, we received cash of $4.7 million, net of the assumed liabilities of $0.3 million. In addition to the cash consideration, we received shares of common stock of Agenus with an aggregate value of $0.5 million, which we subsequently sold in August 2016 for $0.6 million. The remaining common stock of Agenus will only be received upon our satisfaction of certain operational matters, which we are unlikely to satisfy. 
Sale of Future Revenue Streams 
 Royalty Acquisition Agreements
 On December 21, 2016, we entered into two Royalty Interest Acquisition Agreements (together, the “Royalty Acquisition Agreements”) with HealthCare Royalty Partners II, L.P. (“HCRP”). Under the first Royalty Acquisition Agreement, we sold our right to receive milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products subject to a license agreement, dated August 18, 2005, between XOMA and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) (formerly Wyeth) for an upfront cash payment of $6.5 million, plus potential additional payments totaling $4.0 million in the event three specified net sales milestones are met by Pfizer in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Based on estimated sales for 2017, the 2017 sales milestone was not achieved. We remain eligible to receive up to $3.0 million if specified net sales milestones are achieved in 2018 and 2019. Under the second Royalty Acquisition Agreement, we sold all rights to royalties under an Amended and Restated License Agreement dated October 27, 2006 between XOMA and Shire Plc. (formerly Dyax, Corp.) for a cash payment of $11.5 million.
Recently Terminated Agreements 
 Novo Nordisk
 In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novo Nordisk under which we granted Novo Nordisk an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license to our XMetA program of allosteric monoclonal antibodies that positively modulate the insulin receptor (the “XMetA Program”), subject to our retained commercialization rights for rare disease indications. Novo Nordisk had an option to add these additional rights to its license upon payment of an option fee.
 6


Under the agreement, we received a $5.0 million, non-creditable, non-refundable, upfront payment. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we were eligible to receive up to $290.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We were also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered up to a high single-digit percentage rate based on sales levels. 
 On April 20, 2017, we received notice from Novo Nordisk regarding the termination of the exclusive license agreement due to strategic and business reasons. The termination of the exclusive license agreement became effective on July 20, 2017 and XMetA program is now available to license to other parties.
 Financing Agreements
 Novartis
 In connection with the collaboration between XOMA and Novartis AG (then Chiron Corporation), a secured note agreement was executed in May 2005. The note agreement is secured by our interest in the collaboration and was due and payable in full on June 21, 2015. On June 19, 2015, we and NVDI, who assumed the note agreement, agreed to extend the maturity date of our secured note agreement from June 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015, which was then subsequently extended to September 30, 2020. On September 22, 2017, in connection with the XOMA-052 License Agreement with Novartis, we and NIBR, who assumed the note agreement from NVDI, executed an amendment to the note agreement under which we further extended the maturity date of the note to September 30, 2022. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance under this note agreement totaled $14.6 million. 
Servier
 In December 2010, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Servier obtained worldwide rights to cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications (cardiometabolic field) and rights outside the United States and Japan to all other indications, including NIU, Behçet’s disease uveitis and other inflammatory and oncology indications. We retained development and commercialization rights in the United States and Japan for all indications other than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
 In December 2010, we also entered into a loan agreement with Servier (the “Servier Loan Agreement”) that provided for an advance of up to €15.0 million. The loan was fully funded in January 2011, with the proceeds converting to approximately $19.5 million at the date of funding. The loan was secured by an interest in XOMA’s intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab indications worldwide, excluding certain rights in the United States and Japan. Interest was calculated at a floating rate based on a Euro Inter-Bank Offered Rate and was subject to a cap. The interest rate was reset semi-annually in January and July of each year. The Servier Loan Agreement was subsequently amended by a Consent, Transfer, Assumption and Amendment Agreement entered into as of August 12, 2013, where the loan was transferred from XOMA Ireland Limited to XOMA (US) LLC. 
 On January 9, 2015, Servier and we entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Loan Amendment”) to the Servier Loan Agreement. The Loan Amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from January 13, 2016 to three tranches of principal to be repaid as follows: €3.0 million on January 15, 2016, €5.0 million on January 15, 2017, and €7.0 million on January 15, 2018. In addition, the loan would become immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default. In January 2016, we paid the principal amount of €3.0 million. In January 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Servier Loan Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). Amendment No. 3 extended the maturity date of the €5.0 million due on January 15, 2017 to July 15, 2017. The other terms of the loan remained unchanged.
 On August 25, 2017, NIBR settled the Servier Loan Agreement in cash by paying directly to Servier $14.3 million, which represented the outstanding balance of the loan based on a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.1932. The funds that NIBR paid directly to Servier were a portion of the upfront payment due to us under the XOMA-052 License Agreement. As a result of the debt being fully paid, the intellectual property securing the Servier Loan Agreement was released.

Hercules Loan and Security Agreement
 In February 2015, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., (the “Hercules Loan Agreement”) under which we borrowed $20.0 million. 
 The interest rate under the Hercules Loan Agreement was calculated at a rate equal to the greater of either (i) 9.40% plus the prime rate as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal minus 7.25%, and (ii) 9.40%. Payments under the Hercules Loan Agreement were interest only until June 1, 2016, after which we paid equal monthly payments of principal and interest amortized over a 30-month schedule through the scheduled maturity date of September 1, 2018 (the “Hercules Loan Maturity Date”). The entire principal balance, including a balloon payment of principal, would be due and payable on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date. In addition, a final payment of $1.2 million would be due on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, or such earlier date specified in the Hercules Loan Agreement. If we prepaid the loan prior to the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, we would be required to pay Hercules a prepayment charge equal to 1.00% of the amount prepaid. Our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement were secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property.
 On December 21, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Hercules Amendment”) to the Hercules Loan Agreement. Under the Hercules Amendment, Hercules agreed to release its security interest on the assets subject to the Acquisition Agreements with HCRP. In turn, in January 2017, we paid $10.0 million of the outstanding principal balance owed to Hercules. The $10.0 million payment was not subject to any prepayment charge. After taking into account the January 2017 payment, the principal balance of the Hercules Loan was $6.9 million. 
 On March 21, 2017, the Hercules Term Loan was paid in full and we were not required to pay the 1% prepayment charge due pursuant to the terms of the loan. 
 In connection with the Hercules Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules that is exercisable for an aggregate of up to 9,063 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $66.20 per share (the “Hercules Warrant”). The Hercules Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is exercisable for a term beginning on the date of issuance and ending on the earlier to occur of five years from the date of issuance or the consummation of certain acquisitions of XOMA as set forth in the Hercules Warrant. The number of shares for which the Hercules Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in the Hercules Warrant.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses include costs of personnel, supplies, facilities and equipment, consultants, third-party costs and other expenses related to preclinical and clinical testing. In 2017, our research and development expenses were $7.9 million, compared with $44.2 million in 2016 and $70.9 million in 2015.
 Prior to 2017, our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaborative and contract arrangements, which are reimbursed by our collaborators. In March 2017, we initiated a corporate reorganization to discontinue internal product development and terminated our clinical programs as of June 30, 2017, both of which significantly reduced our research and development expenses. Research and development expenses relating to internal projects were $42.8 million in 2016 and $50.2 million in 2015. Research and development expenses related to collaborative and contract arrangements were $1.4 million in 2016 and $20.7 million in 2015. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Some of the drugs our licensees are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our, or our licensees’, products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
 Additionally, our recently-undertaken royalty aggregator model faces competition on at least two fronts. First, there are other companies, funds and other investment vehicles seeking to aggregate royalties or provide alternative financing to development-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The competitive companies, funds and other investment vehicles may have a lower target rate of return, a lower cost of capital or access to greater amounts of capital and thereby may be able to acquire assets that we are also targeting for acquisitions. Second, existing or potential competitors to our partners’ and licensee’s products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
 For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation
 The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners and licensees, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is important to our business and our future income streams will depend in part on our ability to obtain issued patents, and our partners’ and licensees’ ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patents will afford protection against competitors with similar products or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patent applications. Below is a list of our patents and patent applications related to our programs:

* Novartis-owned patent
 **Jointly-owned with Medical University of South Carolina Foundation for Research Development
 If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our partners and licensees may require certain licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms.
 We protect our proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and partners. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that we or our consultants or partners use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our consultants or partners or other third parties, as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 When and if we are able to generate income, a portion of that income may be derived from product sales and other activities of our third-party licensees and partners outside the United States. 
 We have determined that we operate in one business segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker of XOMA. Our property and equipment is held in the United States.
 Financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate and segment information is included in Note 14 to the December 31, 2017, Financial Statements: Concentration of Risk, Segment and Geographic Information.

Concentration of Risk
 Novartis accounted for 95 percent of our total revenue in 2017. Five Prime, Servier, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”) accounted for 27 percent, 22 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of our total revenue in 2016. In 2015, Novartis accounted for 67 percent of our total revenue. At December 31, 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (formerly Centocor Biotech Inc.) accounted for 100 percent of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2016, NIAID accounted for 85 percent of the accounts receivable balance. None of these parties represent a related party to XOMA and the loss of one or more of these partners could have a material effect on our business and financial condition.Employees
 As of March 2, 2018, we employed 12 full-time employees. None of our employees are unionized. Our employees are primarily engaged in executive, business development, finance and administrative positions.
