Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of best-in-class therapeutics that improve and extend the lives of patients with cancer. Our initial focus is on the development of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several potential therapeutic advantages over currently available taxanes, including: oral administration with a low pill burden and a patient-friendly dosing regimen; a formulation that does not contain solubilizing agents that are known to cause hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions; and improved activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Tesetaxel has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies and has demonstrated robust single-agent antitumor activity in two multicenter, Phase 2 studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”). We are conducting a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in MBC, known as CONTESSA, and we expect to report top-line results from this study in 2020. Our goal for tesetaxel is to develop an effective chemotherapy choice for patients that provides quality-of-life advantages over current alternatives.
Breast Cancer and Its Treatment
 Breast cancer is the second-most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases diagnosed per year (World Health Organization). In Europe, an estimated 512,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 149,000 women will die of the disease each year, making it the leading cause of cancer death in women (World Health Organization). In the U.S., an estimated 269,000 new cases are diagnosed and approximately 41,000 women will die of the disease each year, making it the second-leading cause of cancer death in women (American Cancer Society). The 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic breast cancer is approximately 22% (American Cancer Society). Estimated breast cancer incidence and deaths per year in Europe, the U.S. and worldwide are shown in the following table.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of several molecular subtypes, which are commonly grouped into clinical subtypes based on receptor status. Receptors that are assessed in standard clinical practice include the estrogen receptor (“ER”) and progesterone receptor (“PgR”), collectively the hormone receptors (“HR”), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”). Breast cancers generally are categorized by the presence or absence of these receptors. The most common type of breast cancer is HER2 negative and HR positive, accounting for approximately 64% of newly diagnosed cases (Howlader et al, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2014;106(5):1-8). HER2 positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), the latter of which lacks all three receptors, are less common, accounting for approximately 13% and 11% of breast cancers, respectively (Howlader et al, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2014;106(5):1-8). Estimated U.S. breast cancer incidence by receptor status and MBC treatments by receptor status are shown in the following figure.

 Current Treatments for HER2 Negative, HR Positive MBC
 HER2 negative, HR positive disease, which represents the majority of all MBC cases, remains an area of high unmet medical need. Over the past two decades, only modest survival benefits have been achieved in this patient population; hence, treatment goals emphasize controlling disease-related symptoms, minimizing toxicity and maximizing quality-of-life. Patients with HER2 negative, HR positive disease are typically treated with endocrine therapy (with or without targeted agents such as a cyclin-dependent kinase (“CDK”) 4/6 inhibitor), chemotherapy or both.
 3

Endocrine Therapy
 Endocrine agents, which target certain hormone receptors inside and on the surface of tumor cells with the goal of slowing tumor growth, are preferred as initial treatment prior to chemotherapy for most patients with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC. These agents, which typically are used sequentially with or without targeted agents such as a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, include aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole), selective estrogen receptor modulators (“SERMs”; e.g., tamoxifen) and estrogen receptor downregulators (“ERDs”; e.g., fulvestrant).
 The recently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, an orally administered therapy, has significantly improved outcomes for patients with MBC when used in combination with endocrine agents. In a multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study, letrozole plus palbociclib given as initial therapy in post-menopausal women with HER2 negative, ER positive MBC resulted in median progression-free survival (“PFS”) of 24.8 months, compared to 14.5 months with letrozole alone (Finn et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2016;375(20):1925-1936). And, in a different multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study, fulvestrant plus palbociclib given as second-line endocrine therapy in women with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC resulted in median PFS of 9.5 months, compared to 4.6 months with fulvestrant alone (Cristofanilli et al, The Lancet 2016;17(4):425-439). Despite these recent advances in endocrine therapy, virtually all MBC patients will eventually progress and require subsequent treatment with chemotherapy.
 Chemotherapy
 In HER2 negative, HR positive MBC, chemotherapy generally is used following disease progression on endocrine therapy. However, there is also a significant percentage of patients who receive chemotherapy as their first treatment for advanced disease because endocrine therapy is not indicated. This includes patients with: (i) a short relapse-free interval while on adjuvant (immediately following surgery) endocrine therapy (endocrine resistance); (ii) rapidly progressive disease/visceral crisis; and/or (iii) endocrine intolerance. In a recent analysis of a several-thousand-patient record database in Europe and the U.S., chemotherapy-only regimens were given in the first-line setting 33% to 35% of the time in Europe and 34% to 42% of the time in the U.S. (Caldeira et al, Oncology and Therapy 2016;4:189-197).
 Chemotherapy agents used in the treatment of MBC generally are considered to be associated with significant side effects and a negative impact on quality-of-life. The approved chemotherapy agents for the treatment of HER2 negative MBC include: paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel (taxanes); capecitabine (a fluoropyrimidine); doxorubicin and epirubicin (anthracyclines); gemcitabine (a nucleoside inhibitor); ixabepilone (an epothilone approved in the U.S.); and eribulin (a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor). The taxanes and eribulin are approved as monotherapy; capecitabine is approved as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with docetaxel); gemcitabine is approved as combination therapy only (with paclitaxel); and ixabepilone is approved in the U.S. as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with capecitabine).
 4

The choice and sequencing of chemotherapy regimens depend on a number of factors, including physician preference, previous therapies, pre-existing medical conditions, tumor burden and patient symptoms. As shown in the following chart, capecitabine, an oral chemotherapy and taxanes are the preferred first-line chemotherapy agents in HER2 negative, HR positive MBC.

Taxanes
 Taxanes are an established class of anticancer agents that are broadly used in various cancers, including breast cancer. Taxanes destroy cancer cells by preventing them from entering mitosis, a process of cell division, and thereby leading to apoptosis, or cell death. As shown in the figure below, taxanes are one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapy agents in both Europe and the U.S., with more than 2.8 million cycles administered in 2016 (Symphony Health Solutions 2016; IMS Health 2016).

 5

While paclitaxel and docetaxel, the first two taxanes approved for the treatment of breast cancer, possess robust antitumor activity, they have low oral bioavailability and low solubility. Therefore, these pharmaceutical agents must be delivered intravenously, typically at an infusion center, and also are formulated with solubilizing agents that are known to cause hypersensitivity reactions. Nab-paclitaxel, a different formulation of paclitaxel that also is approved for the treatment of breast cancer, has a greatly reduced risk of hypersensitivity reactions, but must still be delivered intravenously.
 Therapies given intravenously at an infusion center often are associated with:
 
 
• Fear of needles and complications associated with venous access; • Anxiety, including institutional-triggered side effects such as nausea and vomiting; • Heightened awareness of life-threatening disease presence; and • Disruption of daily activities.

Capecitabine
 As the only orally administered chemotherapy routinely used for MBC in the U.S., capecitabine offers quality-of-life advantages over intravenous (“IV”) chemotherapy alternatives. In each of the 4 following recently published studies in which breast cancer patients were surveyed as to their preference of treatment modality, the authors concluded that patients preferred oral over IV chemotherapy.

Overall, as shown in the figures that follow, the sales of oral therapies in the treatment of cancer have grown at a higher rate than the sales of injectable therapies over the past 7 years, and capecitabine is one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents in both Europe and the U.S., with more than 2.0 million cycles administered in 2016 (Symphony Health Solutions 2016; IMS Health 2016).

Tesetaxel: A Chemotherapy with Potential Best-in-Class Properties
 Tesetaxel, which we believe will qualify as a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”) if and when a New Drug Application (“NDA”) is submitted, retains the same taxane core as the approved taxanes, but includes the addition of two novel, nitrogen-containing functional groups. Tesetaxel is chemically designed to have high oral bioavailability, high solubility and a long terminal half-life and to not be expelled by the P-glycoprotein (“P-gp”) efflux pump, with the intent of retaining activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. The table below compares some of the chemical and pharmacologic properties of paclitaxel, docetaxel and tesetaxel.

We believe that tesetaxel’s unique properties may translate into significant benefits for patients. These may include:
  
• | Oral administration with a low pill burden and a patient-friendly dosing regimen;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A formulation that does not contain polyoxyethylated castor oil or polysorbate 80, solubilizing agents contained in other taxane formulations known to cause hypersensitivity reactions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Durable antitumor activity.
--+----------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Tesetaxel has exhibited potent antitumor activity in both in vitro (in a test tube) and in vivo (in a live organism) preclinical studies (Shionoya et al, Cancer Science 2003;94(5):459-466). Unique among taxanes, tesetaxel retains potent antitumor activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells, including tumor cells over-expressing the P-gp efflux pump. A defense mechanism of tumor cells, this efflux pump functions to expel toxins, including many chemotherapy agents.
In Vitro Antitumor Activity
 Tesetaxel has exhibited potent antitumor activity in in vitro preclinical studies, with an overall GI50 (the concentration of drug required to inhibit growth by 50%) of less than 1 nM. GI50 is a commonly used preclinical measurement of antitumor potency; lower GI50 numbers connote higher potency (1 nM is 1/1,000th of 1 µM). Of particular note, tesetaxel largely retains antitumor cytotoxic (cell-killing) potency against taxane-resistant (P-gp positive) and other chemotherapy-resistant tumors, while paclitaxel and docetaxel lose considerable antitumor potency (Shionoya et al, Cancer Science 2003;94(5):459-466). The relative loss of cytotoxic potency between P-gp negative and P-gp positive tumor cells and between non-drug-resistant and drug-resistant tumor cells for paclitaxel, docetaxel and tesetaxel is shown in the following table (low numbers connote high potency, and high numbers connote low potency).

In Vivo Antitumor Activity
 Tesetaxel administered orally exhibited significantly greater growth-inhibitory effects (inhibition rate (“IR”) > 90%) than paclitaxel and docetaxel administered IV (IR values of 26%-58%) in a mouse model in which P-gp positive, human breast tumors (DU4475) were implanted in mice (Shionoya et al, Cancer Science 2003;94(5):459-466). The relative in vivo antitumor activity for a control, paclitaxel, docetaxel and tesetaxel is shown in the following graph.

Clinical Studies
 More than 500 patients have been treated with tesetaxel across 22 clinical studies. Tesetaxel was administered as monotherapy in 17 studies and in combination with other agents in 5 studies. Studies have been completed in MBC, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers as first-line, second-line or salvage therapy. Clinical studies that have been conducted with tesetaxel are shown in the following table.
Clinical Studies of Tesetaxel
 
 
N = Number of patients treated CRC = Colorectal cancer NSCLC = Non-small cell lung cancer (1) Includes 46 patients who received tesetaxel once every 21 days. A cohort of 15 patients receiving tesetaxel weekly (days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) was discontinued early due to study termination. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Studies TOB203 and TOB203XT are referred to as Study TOB203. (2) The Phase 1 study in solid tumors was split into Study TOST107, which included data from the first two cycles, and TOST107XT, which included data from patients receiving three or more cycles. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Studies TOST107 and TOST107XT are referred to as Study TOST107.

Tesetaxel, administered both alone and in combination with capecitabine, has been generally well tolerated. In the 8 studies (927A-PRT001, 927A-PRT004, 927E-PRT003, 927E-PRT005, 927E-PRT007, 927A-PRT006, TOST107 and TOST107XT) for which final study data are available, a total of 268 patients received tesetaxel either alone (222 patients from 5 studies) or in combination with capecitabine (46 patients from three studies). The most common Grade ≥ 3 (severe or serious) treatment-related adverse event (“AE”) was neutropenia (low level of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), which occurred in 37% of patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 43% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine and was generally reversible and manageable with supportive measures. Six percent (6%) of patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 11% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine experienced treatment-related febrile neutropenia (fever coinciding with neutropenia).
 Overall, there was no non-hematologic Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related AE that occurred in more than 6% of patients. Three percent (3%) of patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 2% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine experienced Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness and/or pain from damage to the nerves). No patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 11% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine experienced Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related hand-foot syndrome (redness and swelling of the palms and soles, which may progress to dryness, scaling, pain, itching and sometimes blisters and ulceration). Six percent (6%) of patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 7% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine experienced Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related diarrhea. Seventeen percent (17%) of patients receiving tesetaxel alone and 9% of patients receiving tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine experienced any grade of treatment-related alopecia (hair loss). Tesetaxel’s adverse event profile across all completed studies is shown in the following table.

Studies in Patients with MBC
 Study TOB203: A Phase 2 Study of Tesetaxel as First-line Chemotherapy for MBC
 In Study TOB203, 46 patients with HER2 negative, HR positive or negative MBC were enrolled to receive, as first-line chemotherapy, tesetaxel administered orally at 27 mg/m2 (of body surface area: an average female cancer patient is approximately 1.8 m2) on the first day of a 21-day cycle, with escalation to 35 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles depending on tolerability, without anti-allergy premedication. Objective response rate (“ORR”) (complete response (disappearance of all target lesions) + partial response (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions)) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 was the primary endpoint.
 Median age was 58 years (range: 36-80 years). Twenty percent (20%) of patients had triple-negative disease, and the median time from initial diagnosis was 4 years (range: 0-21 years). Sixty-seven percent (67%) of patients received prior endocrine therapy, and 70% had received prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting, with 57% having received a taxane-containing regimen and 52% having received an anthracycline-containing regimen. Common metastatic sites included the lung and lymph nodes (57% of patients each) and the liver and bone (52% each). The figures that follow show the study design and patient characteristics.
 
 13

Forty-four (44) of 46 patients received at least one tumor scan and, therefore, were evaluable for response. The unconfirmed (based on a single scan) ORR was 45% (20 of 44 patients), and the confirmed (based on two tumor scans at least 4 weeks apart in time) ORR was 36% (16 of 44 patients). Median PFS was 5.8 months. Patient best response (confirmed) is shown in the following figure.

Tesetaxel was generally well tolerated. The starting tesetaxel dose (27 mg/m2) was escalated to 35 mg/m2 in 19 of 46 patients. CONTESSA, our Phase 3 study, is using a dose of 27 mg/m2. The most common Grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia, which was more common in the escalated dose (26% of patients in the non-escalated 27 mg/m2 dose group and 42% in the 27 mg/m2 escalated to 35 mg/m2 dose group). The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was 4%. There was no Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy observed in the non-escalated 27 mg/m2 dose group. The incidence of Grade 2 alopecia (significant hair loss) was 15% and similar in both dose groups. There were no hypersensitivity reactions. A summary of Grade ≥ 3 AEs is shown in the following table.

Study 927E-PRT005: A Phase 2 Study of Tesetaxel as Mixed-line Chemotherapy for MBC
 In Study 927E-PRT005, 34 patients with MBC were enrolled to receive, as first-, second- or third-line chemotherapy, tesetaxel administered orally at initial doses of 27 mg/m2 (79% of patients) or 35 mg/m2 (21% of patients) on the first day of a 21-day cycle. Median age was 52 years (range: 32-80 years), and median time from initial diagnosis of breast cancer was 3.5 years (range: 1-19 years).
 Thirty-two percent (32%) of patients had no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease, 65% had one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, and 3% had two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease. All patients received an anthracycline-based regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Common metastatic sites included the liver (59% of patients), bone (44%), lymph nodes (26%) and lung (21%).
 Thirty-two (32) patients completed at least one cycle of therapy and were included in the efficacy population. The unconfirmed ORR was 38% (12 of 32 patients), and the confirmed ORR was 22% (7 of 32 patients). Median time-to-progression was 3.4 months. Patient best response (confirmed) is shown in the following figure.

 Tesetaxel was generally well tolerated. The most common Grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia (35% of patients). The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was 3%, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy (numbness and/or pain from damage to the nerves) was 3%, and the incidence of Grade 2 alopecia was 18%. There were no hypersensitivity reactions. A summary of Grade ≥ 3 AEs is shown in the following table.

We believe that an all-oral regimen that may delay the need to receive intravenous chemotherapy in an infusion center will be preferred by patients. Paclitaxel, the most commonly used taxane in the treatment of MBC, generally requires weekly, several-hour visits to an infusion center, where patients must be pretreated with a corticosteroid, an antihistamine and an H2 antagonist prior to receiving their chemotherapy intravenously. By contrast, tesetaxel monotherapy or tesetaxel plus capecitabine are all-oral regimens that do not require administration in an infusion center. 
 The dosing regimens and patient experience for paclitaxel and tesetaxel are shown in the following table.

CONTESSA: A Multinational, Multicenter, Randomized, Phase 3 Study of Tesetaxel in MBC
 We are conducting a 600-patient, multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study, known as CONTESSA, that will compare tesetaxel (27 mg/m2 on the first day of a 21-day cycle) plus a reduced dose of capecitabine (1,650 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) to the approved dose of capecitabine alone (2,500 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) in patients with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) or adjuvant (immediately following surgery) setting. Where indicated, patients must have received endocrine therapy with or without a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. CONTESSA’s primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (“IRC”). The study is designed (with 90% statistical power) to detect a 42% improvement in PFS (hazard ratio (the ratio of the rates of occurrence of the endpoint events in the two groups of the study) = 0.71; median PFS 8.5 vs. 6.0 months). CONTESSA’s secondary endpoints are overall survival, ORR assessed by IRC, disease control rate (ORR + prolonged (≥24 weeks) stable disease) assessed by IRC and patient reported outcomes (“PROs”).
CONTESSA Study Design
 
In designing CONTESSA, we received non-binding advice from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). We believe CONTESSA may serve as a single pivotal study sufficient for product registration, provided that the study demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint, PFS, for tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine as compared to the approved dose of capecitabine alone as well as an overall favorable benefit-risk profile for the tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine regimen. Generally, a single pivotal study can be sufficient for FDA approval only when the study provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit and in which confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible. There can be no assurance that the outcome of CONTESSA will be sufficient for the approval of tesetaxel by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies or that tesetaxel will be approved at all.
 21

Rationale for CONTESSA Study Design
 CONTESSA is designed to evaluate whether tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine results in improved PFS with manageable toxicity and favorable quality-of-life compared to the approved dose of capecitabine alone. Tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine incorporates two agents with synergistic mechanisms of action and is an all-oral regimen that offers a significant pill-burden reduction compared to the approved dose of capecitabine alone.

Our rationale for the CONTESSA study design includes the following points:
  
• | Capecitabine is a preferred agent as a first- or second-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC. Therefore, capecitabine, at the approved dose, is an appropriate control regimen for a registration-enabling Phase 3 study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is a high unmet medical need for combination chemotherapy regimens with improved benefit-risk profiles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combining the approved dose of capecitabine with currently available taxanes results in robust efficacy but with significant toxicity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical and clinical studies support investigating whether reducing the dose of capecitabine in combination with a taxane will reduce toxicity without a reduction in efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single-agent tesetaxel has demonstrated antitumor activity in two Phase 2 studies in MBC: TOB203 and 927E-PRT005.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a Phase 1 study (TOST107), the combination of tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine was associated with a tolerable AE profile, with minimal overlapping toxicity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capecitabine as an Appropriate Control Regimen
 Capecitabine is a preferred agent as a first- or second-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC, particularly those previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or advanced setting. Therefore, capecitabine, at the approved dose, is an appropriate control regimen for a registration-enabling Phase 3 study. The FDA- and EMA-approved capecitabine regimen is 2,500 mg/m2 on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle.
 Medical Need for Combination Chemotherapy Regimens with Improved Benefit-risk Profiles
 To date, combination chemotherapy regimens generally have not demonstrated superior benefit-risk profiles as compared to single-agent, sequential chemotherapy. Specifically, while currently available combination regimens have been associated with increased PFS and, in the case of docetaxel-capecitabine, increased overall survival, they also have been associated with significantly increased toxicity. As a result, single-agent, sequential chemotherapy remains the standard of care for many patients.
 Nonetheless, there remains a large unmet need for chemotherapy regimens, including combination regimens, with improved benefit-risk profiles. In particular, newer combinations that preserve the response rates and PFS of currently available combination regimens, but are better tolerated and easier to take, are needed.
 An important reason why there is a need for improved combination chemotherapy regimens is the fact that approximately one-third or more of MBC patients do not receive second-line chemotherapy after progressing on first-line chemotherapy, as shown in the following table. Since these patients, who are not necessarily identifiable when first-line chemotherapy is initiated, do not receive second- or later-line chemotherapy, they could benefit from first-line regimens that can significantly increase PFS with minimal increase in toxicity, including regimens that incorporate two therapeutic agents.

 24

Combining the Approved Dose of Capecitabine with Docetaxel, an Approved Taxane
 In a multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study in 511 patients receiving first-, second- or third-line chemotherapy that served as the basis for approval for capecitabine combined with docetaxel in the treatment of MBC, capecitabine at the approved dose of 2,500 mg/m2 (1,250 mg/m2 BID) on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle combined with docetaxel resulted in superior time to disease progression (“TTP”) (hazard ratio = 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.78, p=0.0001) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.95, p=0.01) as compared to docetaxel alone. However, there was significant drug-related toxicity on the combination regimen, resulting in a large percentage of dose reductions and discontinuations (59% of patients reduced their dose of docetaxel and 51% reduced their dose of capecitabine) (O'Shaughnessy et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology 2002;20(12):2812-2823). The results of this Phase 3 study are as follows.

Reducing the Dose of Capecitabine in Combination with a Taxane
 Synergy when Combining a Taxane with Capecitabine in Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies have shown synergy when combining a taxane with capecitabine. Taxanes up-regulate tumor levels of thymidine phosphorylase, the enzyme essential for the activation of capecitabine. Specifically, in two in vivo preclinical studies of breast cancer, the combined administration of capecitabine and docetaxel resulted in antitumor efficacy significantly greater than the sum of the efficacy resulting from either agent administered as monotherapy (see the following figures). Furthermore, the synergy may be tumor-specific, as toxicity as measured by weight loss and effect on peripheral blood cells was minimal. These studies suggest the potential to reduce the dose of capecitabine without loss of efficacy.

 26

Clinical Studies Evaluating Lower Doses of Capecitabine Combined with a Taxane
 Consistent with preclinical findings of synergy between taxanes and capecitabine, clinical studies support investigating the combination of a taxane with a reduced dose of capecitabine such as 1,650 mg/m2/day on the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle, the dose of capecitabine chosen for combination with tesetaxel in CONTESSA. In a review of 18 first-line MBC studies of taxane plus capecitabine combinations shown in the following table, there was no apparent loss of efficacy when comparing capecitabine at 1,650 mg/m2/day to capecitabine at 2,000 mg/m2/day (on the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle). Among these studies, the capecitabine 1,650 mg/m2/day dose was the most studied dose less than 2,000 mg/m2/day (5/8 studies). According to Lortholary, the trend toward improved efficacy with lower doses of capecitabine may result from the significantly lower proportion of patients discontinuing study therapy prematurely because of toxicity, and highlights the importance of administering capecitabine using a schedule that optimizes dose intensity and tolerability (Lortholary et al, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 2012;131:127-135).

Tesetaxel Plus a Reduced Dose of Capecitabine Generally Well Tolerated in Phase 1 Study (TOST107)
 In a Phase 1 study (TOST107), the safety and tolerability of tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine was evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Eight (8) patients received tesetaxel at 27 mg/m2 orally on the first day of each 21-day cycle plus capecitabine at 1,750 mg/m2/day orally on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle, and 9 patients received tesetaxel at 27 mg/m2 orally on the first day of each 21-day cycle plus capecitabine at 2,000 mg/m2/day orally on Days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle.
 27

Tesetaxel in combination with capecitabine at either 1,750 mg/m2/day or 2,000 mg/m2/day was generally well tolerated with no indication of overlapping toxicity. The most common Grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia (47% of patients), which was reversible and manageable with supportive measures. There was a low rate of febrile neutropenia (6% of patients), which only occurred in the tesetaxel 27 mg/m2 plus capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2/day group. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy was 6%, Grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome was 6%, and Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea was 6%. There was no Grade 2 alopecia, and there were no hypersensitivity reactions.
 In response to drug-related side effects, physicians often reduce the dose of chemotherapy received by cancer patients. This reduction, while improving tolerability, can compromise the efficacy of the treatment. The frequency and extent of dose reductions in Study TOST107 as compared to those in the Phase 3 study that served as the basis for approval for capecitabine combined with docetaxel in the treatment of MBC are shown in the following table.

 In summary, we believe that the data support the investigation of tesetaxel at 27 mg/m2 on the first day of a 21-day cycle plus capecitabine at 1,650 mg/m2/day on the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle as a novel, all-oral regimen with a potentially favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of patients with HER2 negative, HR positive MBC.

Studies in Patients with Other Forms of Cancer
 In three studies between 2004 and 2006, tesetaxel as a single agent exhibited antitumor activity in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer (“CRC”) and non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).
  
• | Study 927E-PRT003 was a Phase 2 study in which 35 patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who had failed one previous chemotherapy regimen received single-agent tesetaxel. In this study, the confirmed ORR (as measured by RECIST 1.0), which was the primary endpoint, was 19%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Study 927A-PRT004 was a Phase 2 study in which 71 patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic CRC received single-agent tesetaxel. In patients who had failed one previous chemotherapy regimen, the confirmed ORR (as measured by RECIST 1.0), which was the primary endpoint, was 10%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Study 927E-PRT007 was a Phase 2 study in which 34 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had failed one previous chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease received single-agent tesetaxel. In this study, the confirmed ORR (as measured by RECIST 1.0), which was the primary endpoint, was 7%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Any products that we may develop or discover will compete in highly competitive markets. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
 Tesetaxel faces significant competition. Multiple chemotherapies are currently available to physicians and patients for the treatment of HER2 negative, HR positive MBC. These include: paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel (taxanes); capecitabine (a fluoropyrimidine); doxorubicin and epirubicin (anthracyclines); gemcitabine (a nucleoside inhibitor); ixabepilone (an epothilone that is approved in the U.S.); and eribulin (a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor). The taxanes and eribulin are approved as monotherapy; capecitabine is approved as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with docetaxel); gemcitabine is approved as combination therapy only (with paclitaxel); and ixabepilone is approved in the U.S. as both monotherapy and combination therapy (with capecitabine). In addition, there are novel chemotherapies in development, including new intravenous paclitaxel formulations, such as NantPharma’s Cynviloq and Sun Pharma’s Taclantis, and novel oral paclitaxel formulations, such as Athenex’s Oraxol and Daehwa Pharmaceutical’s DHP107. We believe that the extent to which tesetaxel is adopted by the marketplace, if it is approved, will depend on factors such as its safety and tolerability, efficacy, convenience, effect on quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness relative to other treatment alternatives.
 Daiichi Sankyo License Agreement
 In 2013, we licensed rights to tesetaxel in all major markets from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), the original inventor of the product. Tesetaxel had previously been licensed to Genta Incorporated.
 29

Under the Daiichi Sankyo license agreement, we currently hold exclusive rights to 15 issued patents covering tesetaxel. See “Business—Patents and Proprietary Rights.” We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tesetaxel in the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S. We are required to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $31.0 million, contingent on attainment of certain regulatory milestones, none of which have yet been achieved. Additionally, we will pay Daiichi Sankyo a tiered royalty that ranges from the low to high single digits, depending on annual net sales of tesetaxel. To date, no payments have been made to Daiichi Sankyo under the license agreement. The license agreement and accompanying royalty obligation terminate on a country-by-country basis on the last-to-expire patent in each such country, which we expect will be between 2026 and 2031 in the U.S., 2025 and 2030 in European countries and 2025 and 2030 in Japan, depending on the availability and application of patent term extensions.
 NCE Exclusivity
 We believe that tesetaxel will qualify as an NCE if and when an NDA is submitted. If tesetaxel qualifies as an NCE, we believe that NCE regulatory exclusivity, combined with our intellectual property, assuming the availability of 5 years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act, will provide exclusivity for tesetaxel in all major markets through at least 2031. Separate from patent protection, exclusivity refers to certain delays and prohibitions on approval of competitor drugs available under the statute that attach on approval of a drug.
 Exclusivity in the U.S.
 In the U.S., drugs approved by the FDA are eligible for regulatory exclusivity under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which can delay the approval of generic competition by up to 7.5 years. Specifically, the FDCA provides a 5-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all of the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after 4 years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. This certification will trigger an automatic 30-month stay in the approval of any generic competition, effectively extending the regulatory exclusivity period to 7.5 years.
 NCE exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Exclusivity in Europe
 In Europe, NCEs, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for 8 years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity, for a total of 10 years of regulatory exclusivity. This exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referring to the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for 8 years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but the generic product may not be approved for two years. This 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 30

However, even if a compound is considered to be an NCE and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full Marketing Authorization Application with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical studies and obtain marketing approval of its product.
 Exclusivity in Japan
 In Japan, an NCE is eligible for at least 8 years of regulatory exclusivity. Specifically, under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, the regulatory authority re-examines the safety and efficacy of drugs after drug approval. The data submitted to the regulatory authority is not available to generic drug companies during the re-examination period. This effectively makes the re-examination system a regulatory exclusivity system in Japan. The re-examination period is 10 years following approval for an orphan drug and 8 years for an NCE. Innovators may also benefit from an additional 4- to 10-month waiting period for generic pricing approval. There may be an additional 4 years of market protection granted if a new indication for a drug is registered in the first 8 years of the re-examination period.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We seek and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. We endeavor to patent or in-license technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing terms of marketing or data exclusivity, orphan drug status (if applicable) and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain territories, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 The intellectual property portfolio protecting our tesetaxel program includes 9 U.S., 4 European and 7 Japanese patents, as well as two pending U.S. patent applications and one pending European patent application. Of these, 5 U.S., 4 European and 6 Japanese patents are exclusively licensed to us by Daiichi Sankyo. The 20 issued patents consist of the following:
  
• | Nine (9) U.S. patents, including: (i) two composition-of-matter patents expiring in 2020 and 2026; (ii) 4 method-of-manufacture patents expiring between 2023 and 2031; and (iii) three patents with composition-of-matter, method of manufacture and/or method of use claims expiring between 2031 and 2032, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Four (4) European patents, including: (i) two composition-of-matter patents expiring in 2020 and 2022; and (ii) two method-of-manufacture patents expiring in 2022 and 2025, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seven (7) Japanese patents, including: (i) three composition-of-matter patents expiring between 2020 and 2022; (ii) three method-of-manufacture patents expiring between 2022 and 2025; and (iii) one patent with both composition-of-matter and method-of-manufacture claims expiring in 2031, without taking into account any potential patent term restoration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Among these patents, one issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,410,980) covers the crystal form of tesetaxel used in our clinical formulation and will expire in 2026. If tesetaxel is approved by the FDA, we will be entitled to request patent term restoration that could extend the protection of this patent until 2031. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as the time the FDA spends reviewing our NDA. See “Business—Government Regulation—U.S. Patent Term Restoration.”
 31

Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications and prosecuting existing applications. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) for the manufacture of tesetaxel and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and currently have no plans to build our own clinical- or commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on CDMOs, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee these contract service providers.
 To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of tesetaxel to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.
 Sales and Marketing
 In order to commercialize tesetaxel, if approved, or any other product candidates that we may develop, we must build marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. The commercial infrastructure for oncology products typically consists of a sales force that calls on oncologists, supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales and marketing support and distribution support.
 Additional capabilities important to the oncology marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, integrated delivery networks, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize marketing partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of tesetaxel.
 Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries where we may seek approval to commercialize tesetaxel extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Our product candidates must be approved by these regulatory authorities before they may be legally marketed in the applicable jurisdictions. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Below is a general summary of applicable government regulations affecting our current and planned business activities in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
 32

U.S. Government Regulation
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------


• | seizures or administrative detention of product;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, refusal of government contracts or civil or criminal penalties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Drug Approval Process
 The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) and other applicable regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a NDA or other applications for approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and conformance with the manufacturing-related elements of the application to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND will also include a protocol detailing the objectives of the clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 33

All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA requirements. An institutional review board (“IRB”) must review and approve the protocol and will monitor the study until completion. Clinical studies must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, research subject selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any material amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and sponsors must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner. Sponsors also must make certain financial disclosures to the FDA regarding any financial relationships with study investigators.
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. Initial human testing is often conducted in patients for product candidates intended to treat severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Clinical studies are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. A pivotal study is a clinical study that is intended to meet regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Human clinical studies are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed or may not be completed at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical study at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to accept any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the NDA, which includes an assessment of the preclinical and clinical data, the product’s formulation and manufacturing, and whether the product is safe and effective for the proposed intended use. The review timeline for NDAs for new molecular entities is 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing for a standard review; and 6 months from the date the application is accepted for filing for a priority review.
 34

FDA Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including fast-track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. Different qualifying criteria apply to each program, and each program offers different mechanisms to expedite the development or approval process, such as additional opportunities to meet with the FDA regarding the product candidate’s clinical development program, the opportunity for rolling review of a marketing application, approval based on a surrogate endpoint or, in the case of priority review, a shorter timeline for reviewing a marketing application. We may seek to take advantage of one or more of these expedited programs for tesetaxel or other product candidates in the future. However, even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the development or approval of the product candidate may not be shortened. The FDA may also later determine that a product candidate no longer meets the criteria for designation, and designation does not guarantee that the FDA will ultimately approve the product.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Depending on the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, one of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to 5 years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, provided the patent term restoration does not extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for an extension of patent term for one of our currently owned patents beyond its current expiration date; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval for various reasons, such as non-compliance with regulatory requirements or significant safety and performance problems with the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in recalls or restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events. Manufacturers are also required to comply with restrictions on the advertising and promotion of their products, including restrictions on “off-label” promotion for uses outside those described in the approved product labeling.
 In addition, after a product candidate has been approved, the FDA may require that certain additional post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. Certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain approval from the FDA of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.
 Changes to the manufacturing process for a given drug are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements on us and any third-party manufacturers we use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance and be subject to periodic or for-cause inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to ensure such compliance.
 35

U.S. Reimbursement and Pricing
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of tesetaxel and any other products for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available.
 Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, cash payments, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service or compensation for something other than fair market value. Federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 36

 
under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or improperly promoting a product’s off-label use; violating the Anti-Kickback Statute; or misreporting pricing information to government programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, which requires that manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered by Medicaid report pricing information to CMS on a monthly and quarterly basis, including the best price available to any customer of the manufacturer, with certain exceptions for government programs, and pay prescription rebates to state Medicaid programs based on a statutory formula derived from reported pricing information. State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

European Government Regulation
 In Europe, tesetaxel and any future products we may seek to develop and commercialize may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained.
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical study can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the study is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: The National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees (“EC”). Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical study have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) once the EU Portal and Database are fully functional. It is expected that the Regulation will apply in 2019. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical studies in the EU. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical study via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, which will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical study in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can, in limited circumstances, declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical study cannot be conducted in that Member 
 37

State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical study results to the EU Database.
 European Drug Approval Process
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations:

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). Within 210 days after receipt of a valid application, the competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (“SmPC”) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 38

Patent Term Extension in Europe
 Similar to the patent term extensions available in the U.S., European patent law offers the possibility to apply for a supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”) in order to compensate patent holders for the regulatory delays caused by marketing authorization procedures for medicinal products. SPCs extend the patent term for a period that is equal to the time that elapsed between the filing date of the patent application and the date of the first marketing authorization in the EU, minus 5 years. The overall term of an SPC may not exceed 5 years. An SPC may afford a maximum patent duration of 25 years or, when calculated from the date of first marketing approval, an effective patent exclusivity period of 15 years after first marketing authorization. Applications for SPCs must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing in Europe
 In Europe, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize tesetaxel or any other products, if approved. European countries vary significantly in their approach to coverage, reimbursement and pricing assessments. Some countries allow drug products to be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed to. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The considerations in each country can also vary with respect to the value placed on unmet need, generic availability, dosing, administration, level of innovation and many other dynamics. In certain cases, these decisions are made sequentially and are often interdependent. Many also have multi-layered, decision-making bodies at the country, regional, local and even hospital level, with various responsibilities within the process.
 For example, the United Kingdom typically bases reimbursement decision on a determination of cost effectiveness as defined by cost per quality-adjusted life year (“QALY”), as assessed by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”). Funding by the National Health Service (“NHS”) is typically granted on an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (“ICER”) of £30,000 or less per QALY. Unlike other countries, the United Kingdom does have a specific process for cancer therapies that do not gain NICE recommendation initially. Cancer therapies can enter into a conditional reimbursement agreement for no more than two years funded by the Cancer Drug Fund (“CDF”) while clinical value continues to be assessed in order to inform the final guidance. At the end of this two-year period, recommendation may be granted for permanent reimbursement on fulfillment of the evidence commitment by the manufacturer.
 Similarly, Germany also makes reimbursement decisions based on the determination of additional benefit. Unlike the ICER approach, an efficiency frontier of the total cost and total benefit of all available agents is employed as a cost-benefit methodology. Newly approved agents are compared in terms of cost-benefit ratio either against alternatives or within a specific indication.
 France has its own system of therapeutic index to assess medicines for reimbursement and pricing. Reimbursement is determined through a Service Médical Rendu (“SMR”) rating of clinical benefit (low, moderate, substantial), with the exception of hospital-only drugs that may be reimbursed at 100%. Pricing is negotiated based on an Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu (“ASMR”) rating of therapeutic improvement compared to available alternatives (negative (VI), no improvement (V), minor (IV), moderate (III), substantial (II), major (I)).
 It is possible that we may be required to conduct cost-effectiveness studies of our product candidates relative to other available therapies in certain countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our financial results may suffer.
 39

Japanese Government Regulation
 Tesetaxel and any future products we may seek to develop and commercialize will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in Japan. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) oversees the regulation and safety of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics and food and is the organizational body responsible for approving or rejecting an NDA. Within MHLW, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) oversees regulatory affairs for drugs and medical devices and is the body responsible for regulatory review of NDAs.
Japanese Drug Approval Process
 The drug approval process in Japan involves a series of activities, including preclinical and clinical (Phase 1, 2 and 3) studies, bridging studies, submission of an NDA by the manufacturer, and review of the NDA by the PMDA. MHLW and PMDA are the main regulatory authorities regulating clinical studies. To conduct a clinical study, a pharmaceutical company must register a protocol with MHLW. Prior to submitting a protocol to the MHLW, an applicant usually submits a Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”) to the PMDA. All documents must be translated into Japanese. The notification mainly consists of a description and product summary, preclinical data, the clinical study protocol, analysis plan, SOPs, contact person and the names of participating research institution(s). Also, compliance with GCP often requires an IRB to review the clinical study protocol, provide written informed consent forms for participants and report adverse events.
 In order to obtain marketing approval, an applicant must submit an NDA for drug marketing authorization to the PMDA for review. Once the PMDA has received the NDA, a team of reviewers evaluates the application data, including quality, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, clinical implications, biostatistics and GCP on-site inspection. During the review process, the reviewers exchange opinions with external experts (expert meetings) to discuss important problems. A general review conference attended by team members, external experts and representatives of the applicant is held after the expert meeting. After the review, the PMDA makes a recommendation and sends the application to the MHLW. MHLW then obtains a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (“PAFSC”) before making a decision regarding approval or rejection of the application.
 When data from clinical studies performed in foreign countries are used for an NDA in Japan, the data are first checked to assure that it complies with legal requirements in Japan. Following the legal assessment, an evaluation to determine whether or not the drug is apt to be affected by ethnic factors (intrinsic or extrinsic factors) is conducted. When necessary, a bridging study in Japanese patients is performed, and, when it is concluded that the clinical study outcome in a foreign population can be extrapolated to the Japanese population, the foreign data can be accepted. It is mandatory to conduct pharmacokinetic studies in Japanese people.
 Drug approval reviews are normally processed in the order in which the application forms are received. However, orphan drugs and other drugs considered to be especially important from a medical standpoint, such as new drugs to treat serious diseases, may be designated for priority review.
 Products for priority review are given priority at each stage of the review process as much as possible. For example, for products designated for priority review at the development stage, it is possible to obtain priority interview advice on indications and other items concerning the designated product. The target review period for priority review is 9 months, compared to 12 months for standard reviews.
 Patent-term Extension in Japan
 The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may be extended for the shorter of 5 years or the period during which the patent could not be exploited due to obtaining regulatory approval. This period is calculated from the later of the patent registration date (grant date) or the clinical study start date to the regulatory approval date. Unlike in the U.S., patent-term extension in Japan can be applied to more than one patent.
 40

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing in Japan
 In Japan, there is significant uncertainty as to the reimbursement and pricing status of tesetaxel and any other products for which we may seek regulatory approval. Japanese pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to tight government control. Drug prices are set both according to standardized formulas and through negotiations between government officials and applicant companies on a product-by-product basis. In those negotiations, the level of innovation, usefulness and marketability are important determinants of price. With few exceptions, the Japanese MHLW sets the reimbursement prices for all newly launched prescription drugs in Japan.
 There are currently three main pricing methodologies, which are dependent on the number of similar products available. The Cost Calculation Method applies to first-to-market products and is based on manufacturer cost inputs as well as international reference markets. Comparison Method I applies to products with less than three non-generic competitors and allows for premiums based on innovation, usefulness and marketability among others, plus an adjustment to international reference markets. Comparison Method II is reserved for products with three or more non-generic competitors and anchors price to the lowest competitor in the basket, with only downward adjustments possible to the international reference markets. Over 80% of products in Japan are priced through Comparison Method I.
 In order to control the proportion of the country’s total healthcare expenditure that is devoted to drugs, the government mandates revisions in the prices of all prescription drugs every two years. However, pricing reform introduced in 2016 may have an impact on the commercial landscape in future years. There are three main changes in discussion, including annual pricing reviews, the addition of a cost-effectiveness analysis, and the “huge sellers” provision to reduce budget risk for expensive drugs with significant budget impact. These are expected to go into effect in 2018, with additional proposals under consideration for later roll out, including annual reference pricing, indication expansion discounts and optimal use guidelines. These changes may impact the timeline for pricing negotiations as well as the result of these negotiations. The adoption of more restrictive pricing and reimbursement policies along with existing controls could limit our commercial revenue in the Japanese market.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S., EU and Japan, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and emerging markets, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Corporate Conversion
 On December 6, 2017, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation by filing a certificate of conversion with the Delaware Secretary of State, and we changed our name from “Odonate Therapeutics, LLC” to “Odonate Therapeutics, Inc.” (the “Conversion”). As a result of the Conversion, the membership interests of Odonate Therapeutics, LLC were converted into shares of Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. Prior to the Conversion, we formed a holding company named Odonate Holdings, LLC (“Odonate Holdings”) to own Odonate Therapeutics, LLC. Following the Conversion, Odonate Holdings distributed its interest in Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. to prior members of Odonate Therapeutics, LLC, but retained record title to the 2,931,402 shares of common stock underlying outstanding incentive units previously granted to employees, officers, directors and consultants by Odonate Management Holdings, LLC and 154,285 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Tang Capital Partners, LP.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements for up to 5 years that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These reduced reporting provisions include, among others:

• | a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We have elected to take advantage of the scaled disclosure requirements and other relief described above or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for 5 years unless, prior to that time, we: (i) have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue; (ii) have a market value for our common stock held by non-affiliates of more than $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter of any fiscal year; or (iii) issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We have availed ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations with respect to audited financial statements and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and executive compensation disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and expect to continue to avail ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations available to emerging growth companies in future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 60 employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
