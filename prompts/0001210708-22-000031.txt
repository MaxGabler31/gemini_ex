ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Hudson Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Hudson”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) is a leading total talent solutions provider operating under the brand name Hudson RPO. We deliver innovative, customized recruitment outsourcing and total talent solutions to organizations worldwide. Through our consultative approach, we develop tailored talent solutions designed to meet our clients’ strategic growth initiatives. We are a Delaware corporation, and have operated as an independent publicly held company since April 1, 2003, when Monster Worldwide, Inc., formerly TMP Worldwide, Inc., spun off its eResourcing division.
The Company delivers Recruitment Process Outsourcing (“RPO”) recruitment and contracting solutions tailored to the individual needs of primarily mid-to-large-cap multinational companies. The Company’s RPO delivery teams utilize state-of-the-art recruitment process methodologies and project management expertise in their flexible, turnkey solutions to meet clients’ ongoing business needs. The Company’s RPO services include complete recruitment outsourcing, project-based outsourcing, contingent workforce solutions, and recruitment consulting. 
On October 29, 2021, Hudson completed its acquisition of Karani, LLC, a Chicago-headquartered recruiting services provider that primarily serves U.S.-based customers from its operations in India and the Philippines. Karani, LLC partners with recruitment and staffing firms to assist with recruiting, sourcing, screening, onboarding, and other talent-related services across a variety of industries. This acquisition has enhanced Hudson RPO’s global delivery capability by adding a substantial presence in India and the Philippines, fostering business in new markets, and further developing Hudson RPO’s technology recruitment capabilities.
On October 1, 2020, Hudson completed its acquisition of Coit Staffing, Inc., which expanded its presence in the technology sector and established a Technology Group located in San Francisco. The Technology Group leverages its network and partnerships within the technology sector to seek out new customers and opportunities in other markets around the world. In addition, the Technology Group operates jointly with Hudson RPO’s existing teams in the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, to provide continuous access to knowledge regarding new and emerging technologies in the RPO, Managed Solutions Provider (“MSP”), and Total Talent Solutions space, enabling the Company to better serve its clients around the world.

Our business is dependent upon the continuation of these business relationships as well as new client development.
Market Competition
The markets for the Company’s services and products are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants occur frequently, resulting in considerable market fragmentation. Companies in this industry compete on a number of parameters including degree and quality of candidate and position knowledge, industry expertise, global presence, scalability, service quality, and efficiency in completing assignments. Typically, companies with greater strength or scale in these parameters generate higher margins.
Growth Strategy
We focus on organically growing our RPO business, reducing overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue, and pursuing acquisition opportunities. We target driving organic growth in RPO by investing in people and technology, as well as sales and marketing, to leverage our existing strong reputation in the market. We are investigating acquisition opportunities to expand capabilities and capacity and utilize our net operating losses. We continue to explore all strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including without limitation, improving the market position and profitability of our services in the marketplace, and enhancing our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth, strategic initiatives, or other alternatives. We will also continue to monitor capital markets for opportunities to repurchase shares, and consider other actions designed to enhance shareholder value, as well as review information regarding potential acquisitions and provide information to third parties, from time to time.
Human Capital Resources
The Company’s success significantly depends upon its workforce. The Company employs approximately 1,300 people worldwide, including approximately 150 employees in the United States (“U.S.”) and 1,150 employees internationally. Hudson cares about acquiring, investing in, and retaining top talent as much as our clients do. Hudson RPO’s global and regional employees have vast training and expertise across human capital solutions. Specifically, of the Company’s employees, approximately 1,200 are client-facing consultants who sell and deliver its RPO services to its existing client base. The Company’s consultant population has deep expertise in specific functional areas and industry sectors, and provides broad-based recruitment and solution services based on the needs of each client on a regional and global basis.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees’ health and safety were one of our top priorities. In addition to providing employees with remote working opportunities, we took a range of precautions for those employees who were working in our offices. These included prioritizing personal space; modifying shared spaces with staggered seating to ensure a physical distance from colleagues is maintained; implementing heightened cleaning measures; providing complimentary sanitization products; instituting cleaning standards; and reinforcing capacity protocols with strategically-placed signage. 
Our well-being program, Thrive, provided the framework to support our employees' physical, mental and financial health and well-being in addition to providing our line managers with the guidance needed to support their teams. Our regional

well-being champions rolled out a variety of initiatives aimed at raising awareness and encouraging employees to look after their health and well-being. Our employee assistance programs offered additional support and information to our staff and a range of additional training modules were rolled out focusing on topics such as mental health awareness, health and wellness in the workplace, and keeping remote teams connected.
In addition, the Company values a diverse workplace that honors inclusion and equity. We see differences as a benefit; a diverse mix of minds enables us to create a workplace that fosters creativity, encourages adaptability, and drives innovation. All our employees play an important part in contributing to and shaping our culture. 
We actively look for ways to connect our employees and encourage them to share their perspectives and experiences with one another. We have formed a Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) Program, with employee-led committees set up in each region to promote DEI initiatives within the Company, including a web series featuring members of our Americas leadership team discussing our DEI journey, experiences with race, gender, and cultural differences, and DEI best practices. 
Employees have access to a range of training courses including anti-harassment, discrimination and unconscious bias. eLearning is an integral part of the continuous development journey that we offer to all our employees. Through our long-term partnership with one of the leading eLearning providers, our employees have access to an extensive range of hiring and talent management content delivered by industry experts and renowned thought leaders. Our eLearning courses include over 20 modules specifically on diversity. Tailored learning programs, in which diversity forms a cornerstone, have been created for all client-facing roles.
