ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL

DigitalTown, Inc. (“The Company”, “We”, “Us”, “Our” and “DigitalTown”) provides turn-key hosted solutions to power a comprehensive platform for government entities, citizens and merchants. Our solutions improve the quality of life for residents and visitors through integrated technology for economic development, civic engagement, digital inclusion and smart tourism for cities around the world. The easy to use platform helps city officials and local merchants manage a feature-rich Smart City for web and mobile devices, and provides residents and visitors with access to Content, Community and Commerce.

The Company’s fiscal year end is the last day in February. Our current fiscal year ended on February 28, 2019, and we refer to as “fiscal 2019”. Last year, our fiscal year ended on February 28, 2018 and we refer this year as “fiscal 2018”.

Market Opportunity

We provide an integrated search, community, and commerce platform for both web and mobile devices. DigitalTown powers connected online communities that enable members of a community to find information and acquire the goods and services they need locally when possible. The DigitalTown platform is intended to improve how the local economy consumes and transacts. It does this by helping local community citizens interact with city government, as well as local merchants. Residents and visitors are able to use the DigitalTown powered search engine to access content, community and commerce from an easy search tool. If there are local vendors that can fulfill a product or service that relates to a search term, then those options are presented to the user. Local vendors can also become direct merchants on the platform, effectively allowing the local town to be its own hub for mass commerce.
The Strategic Importance of Local Online Economic Development
The DigitalTown platform elevates local communities to an advanced state of technical capability. To date, most cities have historically taken a hands-off approach towards the Internet. However, we believe city management will further consider the Internet as an integral part of their strategic plan for economic growth.

The continued expansion of big box retailers and steep growth of national eCommerce has created an increased number of challenges for locally owned small businesses. This requires a new approach to online economic development – one that equips local merchants with the means to compete locally and sell nationally. DigitalTown provides a cost-effective solution to help local businesses compete against entities with greater reach, scale and resources.

Why the DigitalTown solution makes sense now
The DigitalTown platform is a cost-effective solution for enabling a community to become a smart community, which we define as connected to shared content and local commerce. A key enabler for this capability is the continued growth of smartphones that are powered by common frameworks, such as Apple iOS and Android. The use of smartphones has enabled individuals to communicate and transact in real-time anywhere they choose using their smartphone, which serves as a proxy for identity, reputation, preferences and method of payment. In effect, the smartphone has become the Digital Wallet. We believe this opportunity is global and our approach, which emphasizes public-private partnerships, will enable accelerated adoption particularly in rural communities where trust of technology is lower, the need is potentially the greatest, and economic models are at the greatest risk.

How the DigitalTown SmartCity Platform is part of the new SmartWeb
A core component of the DigitalTown approach is to build branded web destinations that are intuitive to discover. Part of what makes this possible is the emergence of new domain extensions that are descriptive. For example, .CITY routes a visitor to a website about a city and .MENU routes a user to a website about restaurants in that city. Due to management’s long-standing relation with domain registry operators, the Company will seek to bring structure to the emerging landscape of domain extensions, while at the same time emphasizing distribution of a unified mobile application to work as a digital companion alongside the growing network of direct navigation brands.

The DigitalTown Platform

The DigitalTown platform supports powerful online and mobile communities. We tap into locally relevant news and content in order to keep community members informed. We provide community tools to keep community members connected. We enable commerce and fulfillment in local communities thereby helping residents to buy locally while equipping merchants to sell locally, nationally and even globally.

Content Search
The DigitalTown search engine serves as the core of the local experience. Whereas most residents may go once or twice per year to the official city site, the DigitalTown-powered search engine is designed for daily use as a preferred homepage for local residents and businesses. This will be accomplished through a combination of marketing and education to residents. In addition, we believe adoption can happen through building a strong level of trust with the residents, since our platform will be endorsed or supported by the local government whom the residents know. This compares to large national companies with limited to no connection to the local residents.
Community 
Consumers are already familiar with social networking through applications like Facebook and Twitter. The integrated DigitalTown web service and mobile app make it easy to stay informed, as well as to connect and communicate with other members of a given community. Community members can message, join groups, shop online, and make payments.
Commerce
The DigitalTown platform provides merchants with a turn-key solution for online commerce. Once the approved merchant loads SKU’s and inventory available for sale, the merchants can begin selling without any setup fees or capital investment costs. Transaction processing services are provided by DigitalTown, thereby eliminating the need for each retailer to secure a merchant processing account. The community may also enable a private currency for use within the community.
Courier and Delivery Management
In a growing number of participating cities, an integrated courier and delivery application is included, enabling approved delivery service providers to be notified about items from merchants to be picked up and delivered to the customer, thereby enabling any approved merchant to also offer delivery services to the end-customer. Delivery time is chosen by the customer and can be hours to days.
Administration
The DigitalTown platform provides integrated administrative tools for managing Content, Community and Commerce, making it easy to administer. The administrative tools are designed to be the back end of the smart community. For example, administrators can create Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that are then presented through the site search. This FAQ article is then systematically provided as information when a user makes an inquiry that matches the keywords into the search box on the site.
Intellectual Property

Domain Name Portfolio. The Company is developing a proprietary platform for Smart City Management. As part of this platform rollout, the Company has secured approximately 13,000 of the .CITY domains that map to significant population centers. DigitalTown has methodically secured the .CITY domains through both acquisition from existing registrants, or via direct purchase from the operator of the .CITY registrar.
Software: The Company has developed a proprietary platform for enabling any city to become a Smart City, incorporating advanced features for economic development, community engagement and digital inclusion. In addition, the Company has completed acquisitions of 7 software companies: Cloud.Market, Software Masters, Inc, Rezserve Technologies Ltd, Appointment.com, Comencia Inc, Congo Ltd. and CityInformation BV, each of which brought significant intellectual property and is in process of being fully integrated into the DigitalTown platform. The Company continues to invest in software with an emphasis on capital efficiency and return on investment.
Dispositions

In late fiscal 2019, the Company sold the balance of its useful assets, including 4 of the above-mentioned previously acquired software companies that had not been integrated into the DigitalTown platform. The Company is also no longer acquiring or renewing its domain name portfolio.
