Item 1. Business.
General
Encore Wire Corporation is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1989, with its principal executive office and manufacturing plants located at 1329 Millwood Road, McKinney, Texas 75069. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 562-9473. As used in this annual report, unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we,” “our,” “Company,” “Encore” and “Encore Wire” refer to Encore Wire Corporation.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable. The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, manufactured housing, and data centers.
The principal customers for Encore’s wire are wholesale electrical distributors, who sell building wire and a variety of other products to electrical contractors. The Company sells its products primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives located throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct in-house marketing efforts.
Strategy
Encore’s strategy is to further expand its share of the building wire market primarily by emphasizing a high level of customer service and the addition of new products that complement its current product line, while maintaining and enhancing its low-cost production capabilities. Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design incorporating highly automated manufacturing equipment, an integrated production process and a highly-motivated work force. Encore's plants and principal executive office are all located on one large campus. This single-site campus enables and enhances low-cost manufacturing, distribution and administration, as well as helps to build and maintain a cohesive company culture.
Customer Service: Encore is highly focused on responding to customer needs, with an emphasis on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. Encore seeks to establish customer loyalty by achieving an industry-leading order fill rate and rapidly handling customer orders, shipments, inquiries and, when appropriate, returns. The Company maintains product inventories sufficient to meet anticipated customer demand and believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills orders are key competitive advantages critical to marketing its products.
Product Innovation: Encore has been a leader in bringing new ideas to a commodity product. Encore pioneered the widespread use of color feeder sizes of commercial wire and colors in residential non-metallic cable. The colors have improved on-the-job safety, reduced installation times for contractors and enabled building inspectors to rapidly and accurately inspect construction projects. Encore Wire’s patented SmartColor ID® system for metal-clad and armor-clad cables allows for quick and accurate identification of gauge, number of conductors, wire and jacket type. Our spool-free PullPro® is a lightweight, durable case weighing less than thirty pounds that requires no additional tools for a tangle-free wire pull. We believe our Reel Payoff® is the industry's first self-spinning wooden reel, which allows pulling on or off the pallet with no additional tools. Additionally, Encore currently has multiple patents and patent-pending innovations that range from process improvements to packaging solutions.
Low-Cost Production: Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design and an incentivized work force.
Efficient Plant Design: Encore’s highly automated wire manufacturing equipment is integrated in an efficient design that reduces material handling, labor and in-process inventory.
Incentivized Work Force: The Company has a long term incentive plan that enhances the motivation of its salaried manufacturing supervisors. The Company also has a comprehensive safety program creating a world-class culture by engaging employees, identifying and eliminating risk, and training employees to be successful. The Company provides a 401(k) retirement savings plan to all employees.
Products
Encore offers an electrical building wire product line that consists primarily of NM-B cable, UF-B cable, THHN/THWN-2, XHHW-2, USE-2, RHH/RHW-2 and other types of wire products, including SEU, SER, Photovoltaic, URD, tray cable, metal-clad and armored cable. All of these products are manufactured with copper or aluminum as the current-carrying component of the conductor. The principal bases for differentiation among stock-keeping units are product type, conductor type, diameter, insulation, length, color and packaging.
Manufacturing
The efficiency of Encore’s highly automated manufacturing facility is a key element of its low-cost production capability. Encore’s wire manufacturing lines have been integrated so that the handling of product is substantially reduced throughout the production process. The manufacturing process for the Company’s various products involves multiple steps, including: casting, drawing, stranding, compounding, insulating, cabling, jacketing and armoring.
Encore manufactures and tests all of its products in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards, a nationally recognized testing and standards agency. Additionally, UL representatives routinely visit and test products from each area of manufacturing. 
Customers
Encore sells its wire to wholesale electrical distributors throughout the United States. Most distributors supply products to electrical contractors. Encore’s customers are numerous and diversified. Encore has three customers, each of whom slightly exceeds 10% of the Company's total sales. Encore has no customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Encore believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills customers’ orders is crucial to its ability to expand the market share for its products. The Company also believes that, for a variety of reasons, many customers strive to maintain lean inventories. Because of this trend, the Company seeks to maintain sufficient inventories to satisfy customers’ prompt delivery requirements.
Marketing and Distribution
Encore markets its products throughout the United States primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct in-house marketing efforts.
Encore maintains the majority of its finished product inventory at its service center in McKinney, Texas. In order to provide flexibility in handling customer requests for immediate delivery, additional finished product inventories are maintained at warehouses owned and operated by some of the Company's independent manufacturers’ representatives located strategically across the United States. 
Finished goods are typically delivered to customers by trucks operated by common carriers. The decision regarding the carrier to be used is based primarily on availability and cost.
The Company invoices its customers directly for products purchased and, if an order has been obtained through a manufacturer's representative, the Company pays the representative a commission based on pre-established rates. The Company determines customer credit limits. The Company recorded a $1.5 million and $0.7 million estimate for credit losses in 2021 and 2020 respectively, but recorded no estimates for credit losses in 2019. The manufacturers’ representatives have no discretion to determine prices charged for the Company’s products, and all sales are subject to Company approval. 
Human Capital
General
The Company fosters a culture for our employees based on the old-fashioned values of service, professionalism and stewardship. We encourage our employees to do the right thing under any circumstances and to conform to our Code of Conduct and Ethics. These values are a key aspect of our human capital retention and they inform our employment and compensation philosophies. 
Employees
Encore believes that its hourly employees are highly motivated and that their motivation contributes significantly to Encore’s efficient operation. The Company believes that competitive hourly compensation coupled with sound management practices focuses its employees on maintaining high production standards and product quality.
As of December 31, 2021, Encore had 1,440 employees, 1,190 of whom were paid hourly wages and were primarily engaged in the operation and maintenance of the Company’s manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The Company’s remaining employees were executive, supervisory, administrative, sales and clerical personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with any of its employees.
Compensation and Benefits
The Company rewards employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including attractive medical plans, retirement plans, opportunities for annual bonuses and, for eligible employees, long-term incentives and an employee stock appreciation rights plan. The Company believes that long term incentives like stock-based compensation are a critical part of its compensation program and allows the Company to attract and retain talented employees.
Health and Safety 
Employee health and safety is a top priority for the Company. The Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment and to conducting its various businesses in a safe and environmentally protective manner. All employees and officers are expected to perform their duties consistent with site specific safety and environmental rules and regulations and site application of Company best practices. The Company understands how the health of its employees impacts not only their work, but their family life, too. The Company offers a Medcor On-Site Clinic with a nurse practitioner for employees and their immediate families. For many, the Medcor On-Site Clinic provides basic health screenings and treatment equal to those at a general practice facility which otherwise might not be possible. The Company also offers a wide range of health and wellness services to assist its employees and their families with making good lifestyle choices.
Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s primary focus has been on the wellbeing and safety of its employees and their families. We have taken numerous steps throughout our organization to ensure that our employees have a safe work environment. 
The Company’s corporate workforce worked remotely and successfully through mid-May 2021. For these remote employees, the Company provided supplies needed to work from home, supported information technology needs, and provided guidance for managers to ensure that employees remain connected and maintain physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. In deciding to have its employees return onsite in its facilities, the Company leveraged the advice and recommendations of medical experts, health organizations such as the CDC, and our onside medical partner, Medcor, to implement new protocols to ensure the safety of its onsite employees. These recommendations include face coverings, temperature checks, health certifications, cleaning and disinfection best practices, COVID-19 updates and education, social distancing and capacity limits. Further, the Company supported its employees through programs and benefits provided throughout the year, pivoting all of our people programs and practices to enable business continuity in the current environment. 
Diversity and Inclusion
The Company is committed to and values hiring employees with varied personal and professional backgrounds, perspectives and experiences, promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion. The diversity of the Company’s employees is a tremendous asset, and the Company is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment. The Company is committed to employing and advancing in employment all persons without regard to their race, color, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, genetic information, veteran status, disability, or other protected categories.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Encore in manufacturing its products are copper cathode, copper scrap, PVC thermoplastic compounds, XLPE compounds, aluminum, steel, paper and nylon, all of which are readily available from a number of suppliers. Copper is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products, constituting 81.7% of the dollar value of all raw materials used by the Company during 2021. Copper requirements are purchased primarily from miners and commodity brokers at prices determined each month primarily based on the average daily COMEX closing prices for copper for that month, plus a negotiated premium. The Company also purchases raw materials necessary to manufacture various PVC thermoplastic compounds. These raw materials include PVC resin, clay and plasticizer.
The Company produces copper rod from purchased copper cathode and copper scrap in its own rod fabrication facility. The Company reprocesses copper scrap generated by its operations as well as copper scrap purchased from others. In 2021, the Company’s copper rod fabrication facility manufactured virtually all of the Company’s copper rod requirements. The Company purchases aluminum rod from various suppliers for aluminum wire production.
The Company also compounds its own wire jacket and insulation compounds. The process involves the mixture of PVC raw material components to produce the PVC used to insulate the Company’s wire and cable products. The raw materials include PVC resin, clay and plasticizer. During the last year, the Company’s plastic compounding facility produced the vast majority of the Company’s PVC requirements.
Competition
The electrical wire and cable industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with several companies who manufacture and sell wire and cable products beyond the building wire segment in which the Company competes. The Company’s primary competitors include Southwire Company, Cerro Wire LLC, General Cable (a company of the Prysmian Group) and AFC Cable Systems, Inc.
For all our products, the Company believes that it is competitive with respect to all relevant factors, including order fill rate, quality, pricing, and, in some instances, breadth of product line. 
Compliance with Governmental and Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws covering a wide variety of subject matters, including environmental protection laws and regulations governing the Company’s operations and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances currently or formerly used by the Company. Management believes the Company is in compliance with all such rules including certain environmental permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had a material impact on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. 
Intellectual Property Matters
From time to time, the Company files patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently owns several patents and pending patent applications. The Company also owns several registered trademarks and pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The current registrations for the marks will expire on various dates from 2022 to 2029, but each registration can be renewed indefinitely as long as the respective mark continues to be used in commerce and the requisite proof of continued use or renewal application, as applicable, is filed. These trademarks provide source identification for the goods manufactured and sold by the Company and allow the Company to achieve brand recognition within the industry.
