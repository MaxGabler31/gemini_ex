Item 1. Business

Astra Energy is an emerging company in the waste management industry and the electricity and power generation sectors with a focus on energy production from solar, waste conversion and clean burning fuels. The Company strives to advance clean energy initiatives globally while delivering measurable benefits to communities and value to our investors by investing in and developing renewable and clean energy projects in markets where demand is high and supply is limited.

WASTE CONVERSION:

In August 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. (“Regreen”), a California based company with innovative and patented waste conversion technology and equipment. The Regreen Total Waste System converts municipal solid waste, food waste and plant waste raw material into biomass pellets which are then converted to various fuels and end products. In contrast to typical incinerator based WTE systems, the Regreen Total Waste System uses pyrolysis to burn and convert waste. Pyrolysis is an oxygen-absent process that converts dehydrated biomass into flammable liquids and gases under high temperature conditions. The Regreen system works by converting MSW into dried pellets with extremely low moisture content, which are then fed into a pyrolizer. The pyrolizer produces pyro oils (which can be used in generators and engines), carbon black (typically used in rubber manufacturing), and Syngas, which is further processed to yield jet fuel, green diesel, and bitumen (which can be used for asphalt and roofing).

We will specialize in providing sustainable waste and energy solutions and will safely convert millions of tons of waste from municipalities and businesses into valuable clean, renewable biofuels, biodiesel and jet fuel. The Company will provide comprehensive material management services to communities seeking solutions to some of today’s most complex environmental challenges. The systems used in the power facilities will greatly reduce or eliminate methane emissions from landfills, as well as reduce reliance on imported fuels by replacing them with biofuels made from agricultural products. The Company will create a valued intellectual property portfolio by way of securing global licenses for or co-developing technologies that can convert multiple different waste streams into renewable fuel sources more efficiently and at a considerably lower cost.

Recent legislation in California which requires food waste to be composted with the goal to reduce food waste in landfills by 75%. The State is directly in support of this system as a result. SB 1383, establishes methane reduction targets for California. California SB 1383 is a bill that sets goals to reduce disposal of organic waste in landfills, including edible food. The bill’s purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane, and address food insecurity in California. Aspects of this law ensure that food scraps are composted and compost is purchased by cities. Composting, industrial uses, and animal feed are good environmental uses for inedible food or other organic material.  Landfilling organic waste is a significant source of local air quality pollutants, which can cause respiratory issues and hospitalizations for community members. Beyond this, we are seeing the effects of climate change in California with more severe and lengthy droughts, warmer temperatures that contribute to the increasing number of wildfires (also impacting air quality), bigger storms, and coastal erosion due to rising sea levels. To address the environmental and health concerns of surplus edible food, this law requires 20% of edible food that would otherwise be disposed of in the garbage or compost be recovered for human consumption by 2025. This means surplus edible food will help feed Californians in need instead of decomposing in a landfill while emitting harmful greenhouse gases. 

In May 2022, Regreen entered into a Letter of Intent to install a One Ton-Per-Hour system at a material recovery facility in California. Completion of the installation is pending California Local Enforcement Agency approval relating to solid waste disposal.

On November 20, 2022, Regreen entered into a Joint Venture Investment Cooperation Agreement with Viecotech Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese based company for the manufacture, distribution, and deployment of the patented Regreen waste processing system in the Asia Pacific region. Regreen will hold 50% ownership in the Joint Venture. 

Regreen is currently in negotiations to sell, joint venture and deploy the Regreen system in several countries including India, Panama, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Jamaica, and Ecuador.

Astra Energy is advancing a waste to energy project on the island of Zanzibar to convert 15 tons of municipal solid waste per hour into 10MW/hour of electric power. The project will enable the island to dispose of all its garbage, thereby avoiding the need for a garbage landfill. Landfills are major generators of methane, a major greenhouse gas that is responsible for global warming. There are continuing discussions with the island government. 

The preliminary plan is for Astra to develop, operate, and maintain the waste to energy infrastructure. The power will be fed into the island’s grid network pursuant to a power purchase agreement.

SOLAR:

We are currently completing a feasibility study for the supply and installation of a 40 MW solar farm with battery storage on the island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The plan is to secure a power purchase agreement to feed the power into the grid network. The island of Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous territory of Tanzania in the Indian ocean. Electric power to the island is currently provided using two 100MW submarine cables from mainland Tanzania. These cables are now at capacity. The island wishes to have an independent power supply. Therefore, the immediate need for an additional 50MW of power in less than two years. The Company has initiated negotiations with the government of Zanzibar to provide the required power.
POWER GENERATION

In October, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture with Holcomb Scientific Research Ltd. (“HSR”) to manufacture and distribute the innovative and patent protected Holcomb Inline Generator for homes, commercial applications, solar projects, electric vehicles, large power scale power plants, and many more applications.

HSR is a Research and Development company that has created the patent-protected Holcomb Energy System, a scientific breakthrough in clean energy generation. The HES utilizes the natural energy produced by the electron spin in the iron atom, converting it into usable electricity while requiring no fuel, releasing zero carbon emissions, and having no moving parts - therefore running completely silent.

CLEAN ENERGY:

Astra Energy in concert with the government of Tanzania is advancing a 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant project. The government of Tanzania provided a positive response to the expression of interest and they have requested a technical proposal. Astra is applying for Advocacy support for this project from the US Mission in Tanzania.

The Company is currently in negotiations to acquire an existing 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant (the “Plant”).

Astra is in continuing discussions to secure a gas supply agreement with the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation for the natural gas required to fuel the Plant. Once the agreement is executed, we will begin the process of relocating the Plant to Tanzania. As the Plant is installed, the Company will finalize power purchase agreements and distribution agreements.
