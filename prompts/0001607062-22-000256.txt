Air Purification Solutions: Airocide Air Purification
 On February 8, 2021 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Akida Holdings LLC (“Akida”), which owned the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies for $7.88 million, consisting of $0.76 million in cash and 1.375 million shares of our Common Stock (the “Acquisition”) with a fair market value of $7.12 million. Akida’s revenue for the full calendar year of 2020 was approximately $4.7 million. Prior to the Acquisition, Akida granted KES Science & Technology, Inc. (“KES”) a non-exclusive irrevocable royalty free license (the “KES License”) to manufacture and sell products based on Airocide™ technology in the United States and Canada for use in the commercial food preservation and preparation market, and the cannabis/hemp market. KES also manufactures, distributes and provides technical support for our Airocide™ products pursuant to certain service agreements (the “KES Service Agreements”). At the closing of the KES Acquisition, the KES Service Agreements were assigned to us and we assumed all of the obligations under the KES Service Agreements.
 On September 28, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of KES, including the assignment of contracts related to the supply chain management and sale of the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, for $4.3 million in cash and 300,000 shares of our common stock with a fair market value of $1,959,000 (the “KES Acquisition”). KES’s revenue for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was approximately $4.5 million. The KES Acquisition along with the Acquisition provides us with all of the rights, title and interest to the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, including all of the rights KES had under the KES Service Agreements.
 The Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, originally developed for the National Aeronatuics and Space Administration (“NASA”) with assistance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, titanium dioxide based photocatalyst to eliminate airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses, volatile organic compounds and many odors. We believe Airocide™ can provide solutions to accelerate the reopening of the global economy with applications in the hospitality, hotel, healthcare, nursing homes, grocer, wine, commercial buildings and retail sectors. The Airocide™ system has been used by brands such as DelMonte, Kroger, Opus One, and in March 2021 the Boston Red Sox agreed with SteriLumen to install an Airocide™ system at Fenway Park and JetBlue Park.
 The core Airocide™ technology has been in use on the International Space Station and is based on photo-catalytic oxidation (PCO), a bioconversion process that continuously converts damaging molds, microorganisms, dangerous pathogens, destructive volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and biological gasses into harmless water vapor.
 Unlike other air purification systems that provide “active” air cleaning, ozone producing systems, ionization or “photo-electrochemical oxidation”, Airocide’s nanocoating technology permanently bonds titanium dioxide to the surface of the catalytic bed. This permits the perpetual generation of surface-bound (OH-) radicals over the large surface area created by their advanced geometric design and prevents the generation and release of ozone and other harmful byproducts. The proprietary formulation and methods for creating the catalyst are the basis of Airocide’s competitive advantage, making it the only consistently robust, highly effective, ozone free PCO technology on the market.

Airocide™ has been tested over the past 12 years by governmental agencies such as NASA, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, independent universities including the University of Wisconsin, Texas Tech University and Texas A&M, and air quality science laboratories. Airocide technology has been cleared by the FDA as a class II medical device, making it suitable for providing medical grade air purification in critical hospital use cases. Airocide® product lines include: APS (consumer units) and the GCS and HD lines (commercial units) and will enable the commercial units with SteriLumen’s Clarity D3™ app to bring connectivity, reporting and asset management to our air purification products.
 The APS series provides true choice, low maintenance filter-less PCO or a filtered air purification option ideal for restaurants, conference rooms, residential and small business or home office spaces. The GCS series is suitable for larger public spaces and enclosed rooms that may have high occupancy such as offices, waiting rooms and hotel lobbies, and airport gate areas. The HD series is the most powerful, providing two-stage purification for fast sanitization of larger or industrial spaces such as sporting venues and locker rooms, airports, museums, winery cellars, warehouses and food-processing facilities. All Airocide™ products also extend the life of any perishables like fruit, produce or flowers.
 Scientific Air
 On October 13, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Old SAM Partners, LLC F/K/A Scientific Air Management, LLC (“Old SAM”), which owned a line of air purification technologies (“Scientific Air”) for a purchase price of $9.5 million in cash and 200,000 fully vested shares of our Common Stock (the “Vested Shares”) and 200,000 shares of our Common Stock that are subject to vesting (the “Earnout Shares”) (the “’SciAir’ Acquisition”). The number of shares of Common Stock included in the purchase price was based on a per share value of $10.00. With respect to the Vested Shares and the Earnout Shares, the Acquisition agreement provided that we would pay additional cash compensation to Scientific Air if the if the 20 day average price of our common stock was below $10.00 on April 14, 2022, in the case of the Vested Shares or March 31, 2023, in the case of the Earnout Shares. Such amounts were payable only if Old SAM or its affiliates owned Vested Shares or Earnout Shares on the applicable determination date. As described below, Old SAM and certain of its affiliates have relinquished their right to all 400,000 Vested Shares and Earnout Shares.
 On March 31, 2022 we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Old SAM and the members thereof who executed the Settlement Agreement (collectively, the “Old SAM Parties”), pursuant to which the Old SAM Parties relinquished all of their right, title and interest in any of the Vested Shares and the Earnout Shares and no longer have the right to any additional cash consideration as described above. The Settlement Agreement also contains a mutual release of all claims we and the Old SAM parties have against each other, other than claims related to certain consulting agreements executed in connection with Acquisition. The Settlement Agreement was not the result of any litigation, and no claims were filed by us against any of the Old SAM Parties or by any of the Old SAM Parties against us.
 The Scientific Air product line uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, patented system to eliminate airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses, volatile organic compounds and many odors without producing any harmful by- products. Scientific Air’s products are well suited for larger spaces within a facility due to the higher air flow of these units. The units are also mobile with industrial grade casters, allowing for movement throughout a facility to address increased bio burden from larger meetings or increased human traffic. Both of these key items extend our Airocide line, creating a comprehensive air disinfection portfolio that spans from small to large spaces and mobile applications. 
 Scientific Air’s products are currently sold predominantly in North America and into the healthcare market. We see a number of bidirectional synergies. First, we look to leverage Airocide’s global distribution capabilities to start distributing Scientific Air’s products internationally. Second, we look to leverage Scientific Air’s strength in healthcare to pull through existing Airocide units, creating a broad healthcare product line, from small clinics, patient rooms and doctor’s offices to larger spaces such as nursing stations, waiting rooms and cafeterias. Scientific Air currently leverages one of the largest healthcare distributors in North America, which is a relationship we intend to further develop to increase our customer base and revenue. Finally, we look to extend our Data Driven Disinfection platform by integrating all our units via our Clarity D3 web and mobile phone application, creating smart asset management, reporting, and control across enterprises.

Market Opportunity
 Our goal is to build a company that successfully designs, develops and markets our platform for Data Driven Disinfection which will enable US and global economies to re-open and provide safe environments during and following the pandemic. Our platform will also be positioned to help decrease the national rate of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs). We will seek to achieve this goal by having our products actively involved in the following activities:
 • Focus on large facilities in hospitality and sporting venues: this market segment has strong incentives to invest in additional disinfection to ensure guests and patrons return and increase sales to pre-pandemic levels. Hotels wishing to make disinfection, safety, and cleanliness part of their branded experience can benefit from our solutions and products. In addition to existing and developing Airocide and Lumicide specific sales efforts, we intend to leverage the Company’s hospitality business for cross-selling opportunities of our air purification and surface disinfectant solutions and products. Our initial research indicates that the key stakeholders in this market value the asset management and reporting capabilities of our platform and provide key points of differentiation.
 • Secondary focus on healthcare facilities outside of the hospital market: (i) Target infection prevention professionals in healthcare facilities including assisted living and long-term care, clinics and ambulatory surgical centers.; (ii) Identify and target facilities that have been fined for high infection rates.
 • Leverage relationships with Environmental Health and Safety organizations who are responsible for employee safety.
 • Continue scientific validation through lab testing and data from real world deployments; publish case studies in peer reviewed journals.
 • Leverage an outsourced supply chain: Leverage an outsourced supply chain for production and warehousing.
 Beyond healthcare facilities, we are prioritizing our opportunities in additional market segments:
 Airplane and Cruise Line Bathrooms. Because of the close quarters inside most airplane cabins, pathogens can easily be spread amongst passengers, especially on long flights where airplane bathrooms have more use and may not be cleaned before flight’s end. Our Data Driven Disinfection platform could provide an important means for disinfecting airplane bathrooms, keeping track of cleanliness during flights, and decreasing the spread of germs in the airplane cabin.
 Schools. Schools and education authorities pay very close attention to disinfection to prevent the spread of influenza as well as other contagious threats. The CDC maintains guidelines for disinfection of schools and many other organizations also advise schools on proper disinfection protocol. Our disinfection systems could find a receptive audience among school facilities managers looking for new solutions that can assist in safely returning students to classrooms during the pandemic and post Covid-19.
 Restaurants. Given the need to prevent foodborne illness, restaurants are constantly urging staff to wash their hands and are required by public health authorities to keep their premises as clean and germ-free as possible. There is an opportunity to become part of upscale restaurants’ strategy to demonstrate dedication and commitment to customers and health department to reduce the spread of infections within their establishment.
 Homes. Our Airocide brands have a strong foothold in the consumer marketplace and we will expand digital marketing activities to gain greater market share.

Surface Disinfection Solutions: Lumicide 
 The Company’s Lumicide brand of products are unique, patented, and automated disinfecting systems that rely on LEDs in the “C” range of the ultraviolet spectrum (UVC). Lumicide offers configurable options for placement of the UVC LEDs in a wide variety of fixtures including but not limited to vanities, restrooms, above desks or along countertops. Lumicide disinfects hard surfaces within 12 to 24 inches of the unit, generating adequate energy required to kill pathogens in a typical disinfection cycle at extremely low power measured in milliwatts. Lumicide has been tested by ResInnova Laboratories, an International Antimicrobial Council certified BSL-2 testing facility (“ResInnova”).
 Our product platform includes the following attributes:
 • Focus on high-contamination surfaces Focuses on pathogens that accumulate on the sink area, including handles, faucets, backsplash and in the drain.
 • Germicidal UVC LEDs. The UVC LEDs in our devices have demonstrated destruction of the most clinically relevant pathogens causing HAIs as well as destruction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.
 • Automatic operation. A built-in programmable controller within the unit ensures operation for the appropriate UVC dosage required to conduct four logs pathogen destruction and is not dependent on manual operation. Its functionality is expandable and may become a source for recurring income through additional data reporting, leasing and maintenance of add-on elements. 
 • Continuous operation. Works in pre-programmed cycles that can be managed by an on-board programmable controller. The motion detectors enclosed within each device allow continuous disinfection of high contamination areas as long as room occupants are outside a safe distance of the device. Research has shown that microbes can rebound to pre-disinfection levels within two hours following manual cleaning and disinfection. Lumicide products operating continuously mitigate pathogen regeneration.
 • Safety. Built-in redundant motion sensors automatically shut off when movement is detected within range of the UVC light, or failure of motion sensors on the unit, eliminating safety concerns about UVC exposure. Once there is no movement in the room for programmed time period, Lumcide comes back on to restart and continue its cycle.
 We currently have five product lines incorporating Lumicide including:
 (i) disinfecting drain device (in market);
 (ii) disinfecting shelf, is a ribbon that can be installed above a sink, beneath an existing bathroom mirror, or above other high-contamination risk surfaces (in market);
 (iii) disinfecting back-lit mirror (in development);
 (iv) mirrored medicine cabinet for residential use (in development).
 The Company has pursued validation of its platform in both laboratory and real clinical settings. Devices were independently tested in 2017, before the pandemic, and again in 2020 at ResInnova Laboratories, an International Antimicrobial Council certified BSL-2 testing facility. The disinfecting mirror and disinfecting drain devices were found to be effective in killing (3-4 log reductions) the most infectious and clinically important pathogens including C. difficile, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), E. Coli, and OC43 human coronavirus, a strain structurally and genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2 and accepted as a surrogate for that virus. The Company is also sponsoring a study at Mount Sinai and its Icahn School of Medicine on the effectiveness of Lumicide in patient bathrooms in a New York hospital in the Mount Sinai system. Mount Sinai has agreed to provide the results of their study in a report to be issued in the third quarter of 2022 as well as publishing their results in an academic, peer reviewed journal.
