Item 1. Business
 We are an Emerging Growth Company with revenue generating operations. We were formed on June 23, 2017 and have four years of business experience.
 The United Express operates as a general company of transportation, dispatch service logistics, delivery merchandises and other items for companies and individuals across the United State. As such, it is difficult to determine the average customer of the Company as the business will have the freedom and the ability to effectively arrange for the transportation any type of merchandise. Management anticipates that the business will receive orders for service from companies seeking to move merchandise, as well as, people relocating to different areas of the target regional market areas. A primary concern for the Company is its ability to quickly respond to customer request, give affordable price for the services, and carry the full responsibility from pick up to drop off. Slight fluctuations in oil prices has caused the freight and logistic industries costs to be almost on a straight level during last 12 months. In the event of a significant increase the price of fuel, we will also reasonably increase prices (at a standardized rate of markup) to ensure the profitability of the business.
 Our other activities are providing dispatch services for the other companies. We working with CVK Express and doing dispatch service for them. In this field company doing search for transportation providers and connect them to cargo owners based upon delivery requirements, transportation routes, type of shipment, equipment requirements, cargo size, delivery time and price.
 Also, in this fiscal year we working with Royal Realty Enterprise, Inc to purchase from them used home
 appliances and sell it to appliance companies for further installation.
 During reported period our business activities have focused on the development of our business plan, locating producers of goods, despatchers, sell used appliances, researching for new customers, van supplies, development of optimal traffic routes.
  Revenues
 Our revenues from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 was $1,069,004. We currently have many customers working with us. We generated revenue from dispatch, logistics services and activities for selling used appliances.
Marketing Program
 We expect that the business will expand during the next five years of operation. Mr. Stoukan intends to implement marketing campaigns that will effectively target small businesses, medium sized businesses, product sellers, and distribution companies within the target market.

Working in logistics industry we observe desire truck owner operators or drivers get paid right after Bill of lading signed and cargo unloaded, instead of waiting 30-40 days. Factoring service can be solutions in this situation. In the simplest terms, invoice factoring is how get paid fast in the trucking industry. It's a way to get consistent cash flow for unpaid invoices.
 Drivers agree get pay 4% (factoring fees) less than original enrings. Based on:
 1 driver generates earnings somewhere about $40,000 in a month and 4% is $1,600. We can operate with 100 drivers at the same time during a month. So, our expenses with 100 drivers will be $4,000,000 and 5% is $160,000.
 Consistent cash flow is a key in being successful in the transportation industry. It's always good to have that safety net to know you will always get paid within 24-48 hours when you use a factoring service.
 Another direction in which we are going to excel is directly working with Hyundai manufacturing located in Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico. It’s very close to US border and we see a great potential in this. They build over 150 containers per day and we want to delivery their Hyundai dry van containers to US customers. Base on our research they pay $700 per container and allowed to download cargo to deliver it to the final destination. The other dealers who already work with Hyundai can pay us only half of this price for the same route. In this activity we plan to generate extra $15,000-$20,000 in a month net income.
 In addition, given the high demand for these containers, we can also buy them at the production price and resell them at a premium or even rent them out. For this activity we need at least $30,000 for one dry van. We can give trailer for rent $1000 in a month with full payback in 2.5 years. We are planning begin with 40-50 trailers and we need about 1,3-1,5 millions of attracted capital. Repairs and maintenance will be calculated additionally if necessary.
 Base on the above we need around $5,5-6 millions for these new activities.
