Overview

Carbon Ion is developing next generation supercapacitor technology aimed at the grid and other energy storage applications. 

We see ‘Hybrid’ solutions, by combining the best in class battery solutions with super capacitors, as the way forward to deliver sustainable energy for the next three decades and a grid which is fit for the future. Super Capacitors are different but complimentary technology to batteries. 

We are at the beginning of a forecasted once-in-a-century shift in moving away from fossil fuels to power our energy requirements across all demands for electricity.

For example, while current battery technology has demonstrated the benefits of EVs, principally in the premium passenger car market, there are fundamental limitations inhibiting widespread adoption of battery technology. They can catch fire easily, they use rare earth materials and have limited life span and the power delivery is compromised. They are not a universally applicable energy store.

Lamborghini recognised this in their recently launched supercar costing $3.5M the ‘Sian’ that has adopted regenerative braking using super capacitors as their first move to electric powertrains. Supercapacitors can deliver more power, more quickly than a battery solution. As part of the VW Group, Lamborghini elected to go a different route to the rest with their first ever hybrid car, and not follow the industry orthodoxy of a Lithium battery solution. As a result, we believe a hybrid solution using new super capacitor technology with complimentary battery technology represents the most promising path to unlock a mass market shift. A super capacitor can provide that immediate fast delivery (instant kick) mechanism and then once momentum and velocity is achieved the system moves over to battery power. In this way, the system can be better optimised for both cost and performance.

After 30 years of gradual improvements in conventional lithium-ion batteries we believe (like others in the industry) the market needs a step change in battery technology to make mass market EVs competitive with the fossil fuel alternative. We have gone, like Lamborghini’s terzo millenio does, down a direct route to achieve this goal.

We have spent the last decade developing a proprietary supercapacitor technology to meet this challenge. We believe that our technology enables a new category of supercapacitor that meets the requirements for broader market adoption. The Carbon-ion (C-ion) Super Capacitor technology that we are developing is being designed to offer greater energy density and safety when compared to today’s conventional super capacitors and longer life and faster charging than batteries.

We are focused on energy storage applications, which have a stringent set of requirements for super capacitor butour super capacitor technology also has applicability in other large and growing markets such as frequency response and fast recovery storage. Supercapacitors are best used when you need energy fast.

We will continue developing our C-ion super capacitor carbon-ion technology with the goal of beginning transfer to commercial production in the first half of 2025. We have evaluated each of the elements required for initial success and calculated the high performance which we expect from their combination. We are now working to combine and optimize all components of the cell. We will then further develop volume manufacturing processes to enable high volume manufacturing and minimize manufacturing costs. 

We are looking to raise funds that will enable us to expand and accelerate research and development activities and undertake additional initiatives. As well as continuing to develop our scientific and engineering capabilities iat Milton Park Abingdon England, we will use third party pilot lines, to achieve our goal of being prepared to begin the transition to high volume manufacturing capability from 2025.

We intend to work closely with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to make our cells widely available over time. We recognize that our super capacitor technology has applicability in other large and growing markets including energy storage and other electricity grid type environments such a frequency response. We expect that the heavy transport industries such a shipping, trains, planes and nascent infrastructure charging will also feature. 

Our technology enables a variety of business models. In addition to joint ventures, we may look to operate solely-owned manufacturing facilities or license technology to other manufacturers. Where appropriate, we may sell know how, electrodes or other subassemblies rather than complete super capacitor cells. We intend to continue to invest in research and development beyond Gen 4.0 to improve super capacitor cell performance, improve manufacturing processes, and reduce cost subject to having raised sufficient funds to do this.

Carbon-Ion was founded to develop a new class of energy storage device with considerable functional improvements over commercially available supercapacitors or ‘ultracapacitors’.

The C-Ion cell will provide specific power characteristics much higher than a Li-ion cell. It is designed to be classified as non-flammable and non-hazardous for transport, allowing the product to be shipped easily and to comply with both current and future regulations.

Due to the method of energy storage, the cell has fewer moving parts electrochemically and can go through significantly more charge/discharge cycles and/or operate for many years of normal use. 

The C-Ion cell is being designed for manufacture using technologies well known in high volume manufacture. This will enable Carbon-Ion to quickly scale-up production. Carbon-ion allows new products to be made and extra functions to be added to existing products, for example:


· | Improved energy storage allows the cell to be used as the principal method of energy storage in a far wider range of technologies than conventional supercapacitors 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | High specific power allows very fast charging 
· | High specific power enables the extension of Li-ion battery lifetimes and reduction in battery size through peak shaving in hybrid applications 
· | Improved safety protects customers, allows easy shipping and opens up applications in hazardous areas 
· | Long cycle life allows energy storage to be installed for the entire lifetime of the device, reducing design complexity, eliminating service intervals and saving money

Industry Background 

We believe that governmental action on climate change and the consequent drive to zero-carbon energy generation must lead to adoption of a rapidly increasing percentage of renewables in electricity generation markets. Legislation, regulation and consumer preferences coupled with growing government incentives are necessitating a once-in-a-century shift towards transient generation with basedload replaced by a range of innovative energy storage solutions.

Countries around the world are promoting a shift to renewable energy generation. The dependence on fossil fuels to power electricity is one of the largest environmental concerns, and has created reliance among industrialized and developing nations on large oil and gas imports. In turn this has exposed consumers to unstable fuel and electricity prices and health concerns related to heightened emissions. 

Adding more renewables to the grid makes for an increasingly transient generation and provides challenges with frequency regulation which can be met by using high power energy storage such as C-Ion. Hybrid energy storage systems on the grid can provide a range of services which address changes to supply (renewables) and demand (e.g. EVs) sides of the equation.

Many national and regional regulatory bodies have adopted legislation to incentivize or require a shift to lower-emission and zero-emission vehicles. For example, over a dozen of countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, France and Norway have announced intentions to either increase applicable environmental targets or outright ban the sale of new electric vehicles in the next two decades. In 2020, California passed regulations requiring half of trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035 and 100% by 2045. In 2021, the United States outlined the target of 50% EV sales share by 2030 and the European Union proposed an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035. This global push to transition from ICE vehicles, aided by favorable government incentives and regulations, is accelerating the growth in lower- and zero-emission vehicle markets.

Furthermore, governments and consumers are increasingly considering alternative energy storage solutions for a variety of reasons including better performance, deferring infrastructure upgrade costs, significantly lighter environmental impact, and lower maintenance and operating costs. Automakers such as Tesla, Inc. have demonstrated that premium EVs can deliver a compelling alternative to fossil fuels. As EVs become more competitive and more affordable, we believe that they will continue to take market share from ICE vehicles. Bloomberg estimate that the world demand for lithium-ion batteries could reach 400GWh (Giga Watt hours) by 2025 as demand for electric vehicles grows. We believe that this shift will occur across the entire electricity chain and market segments. However, the inherent limitations of lithium-ion battery technology continue to impede improvements in EV competitiveness and cost. 

At the same time the mass roll-out of EVs will challenge national grid infrastructure. In both Grid and EV, we think Hybrid solutions using both Super Capacitors and batteries in combination will be the future.

Areas where Hybridisation with Super Capacitors boosts and protects Battery 

In particular, we highlight four areas where hybridisation will drive broad adoption of energy storage solutions:


-6-


· | Right Sizing (Energy for Energy, Power for Power). Today’s battery systems are generally either oversized (Grid) or run at the limit of their capability (EV) in terms of power. This leads to additional cost or shortened lifetimes and safety concerns. Our view is that, in a hybrid system, when you want power use Carbon-Ion and when you want energy use the battery. This means that the system can be optimised to maximise beneficial aspects of each technology while mitigating others.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Safety (nonflammable). Carbon-Ion cells are not flammable and will not catch fire. It is also possible that they could reduce the risk of fire in a hybrid system. Carbon-ion is also more tolerant of temperature fluctuation and limit the requirement for costly cooling systems. 
· | Cost. By right sizing and simplification of cooling and safety systems, more options are available for cost optimisation at a system level. Improvements in lifetime also lower total cost of ownership. 
· | Cycle life. By taking on the high power peaks and troughs of a typical drive cycle (either EV or Grid), Carbon-Ion cells can protect batteries when hybridised resulting in longer lifetimes. Carbon-Ion cells are capable of many fast cycles thus reducing the number of cycles experienced by the battery. 


Supercapacitor technologies on the market today provide some of the qualities necessary for the game changing hybrid systems we imagine above but are limited in terms of Energy Density and make compromises in terms of safety and sustainability.


· | Carbon Ion aims to increase energy density more than threefold over it’s own previous generation of technology (industry leading performance measured in prototype pouches)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Carbon Ion does not use the commonly used but flammable and harmful solvent, Acetonitrile (methyl cyanide) in its electrolytes. 

Our Product Strategy

The Company is developing and bringing to market the next generation of capacitive energy storage. These C-Ion cells use improved materials and efficient design to solve global problems in (i) delivery of power-on-demand, (ii) grid management and (iii) electric vehicles. 

A very wide range of energy storage technologies will be needed in order to transition from a fossil-fuel based energy system to a system fueled by renewable energy sources. We believe that hybrid solutions where both supercapacitors and batteries work together will become increasingly essential. We are developing C-Ion products fit for this renewable age. 

We believe that governmental action on climate change—and the consequent drive to zero-carbon energy generation—will lead to adoption of a rapidly increasing percentage of renewables in electricity generation markets. Legislation, regulation and consumer preferences, coupled with growing government incentives, are necessitating a once-in-a-century shift towards transient generation with baseload replaced by a range of innovative energy storage solutions.

The dependence on fossil fuels to power electricity is one of the largest environmental concerns and has created reliance among industrialized and developing nations on large oil and gas imports In turn this has exposed consumers to unstable fuel and electricity prices and health concerns related to heightened emissions. 

Power-on-Demand

The world is in the midst of a potential transition to fully electric living, which transition would disrupt nearly every industry on the planet. As a result, there is a critical need for better and more diverse energy storage in order for many industries to provide more impactful solutions to consumers of all kinds. We intend to bridge this gap in a groundbreaking way by delivering fast and clean power on demand to a broad range of applications from infrastructure to individual products. The C-Ion cells that we are developing have unique properties that allow them to charge and discharge extremely quickly, while still retaining meaningful energy storage. These unique C-Ion cells deliver a powerful boost in hybrid systems with potential applications in enhanced grid revenue stacking or even powering take-off in electric-powered aviation.

The Company’s proposed technology and unique material properties enable an extremely fast response time that adds more value to the entire power system. C-Ion cells are designed to deliver high cycle life and ramping capabilities, along with repeated high cyclic storage with no performance degradation. This creates significant efficiencies in energy systems that will, in turn, save money, time, and resources.

Grid Market Management (Dynamic Containment) 

Adding more renewables to the grid make for increasingly transient generation and provides challenges with frequency regulation which can be met by using high power energy storage such as C-Ion. Hybrid energy storage systems on the grid can provide a range of services which address changes to supply (renewables) and demand (e.g., EVs) sides of the equation.

Significant loss of grid inertia has led to more numerous frequency deviations than before, and a range of technologies is needed to move toward a grid that is fully supplied by sustainable generation. This need to plug the gap in grid inertia will be true in every country in the world if the goal of ‘net-zero’ is adopted. The technology that we are developing can perform several roles to address issues in sustainable generation. C-Ion technology harnesses the ability to perform fast-responding, short-term energy storage to take energy from or provide energy to the grid and can provide support to improve the round-trip efficiency of renewable energy generation assets.

There are major problems with grid management in: (i) access to raw energy on short notice, and (ii) maintaining the frequency of the alternating current within the narrow 50Hz bandwidth. Supercapacitors can provide both the amount of power-on-demand (as in the case of an off-line power station), and the ability to balance the frequency required by all electrical equipment. 

As the world moves away from fossil and nuclear fuels toward green energy like solar and wind, the energy input into the grid will require energy management to keep the various fluctuations of grid systems balanced. Supercapacitors offer the speed and the volume of energy required to keep grid systems up and running in the case of a sudden loss of energy input. 

Electric Vehicles

Many national and regional regulatory bodies have adopted legislation to incentivize or require a shift to lower-emission and zero-emission vehicles. For example, over a dozen of countries including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, France and Norway have announced intentions to either increase applicable environmental targets or outright ban the sale of new ICE vehicles in the next two decades. In 2020, California passed regulations requiring half of trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035 and 100% by 2045. In 2021, the United States outlined the target of 50% EV sales share by 2030 and the European Union proposed an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035. This global push to transition from ICE vehicles, aided by favorable government incentives and regulations, is accelerating the growth in lower- and zero-emission vehicle markets.

Bloomberg estimates that the world demand for Li-ion batteries could reach 400GWh (Gigawatt hours) by 2025 as demand for electric vehicles grows. At the same time, the mass roll-out of electric vehicles will challenge grid infrastructures. We believe that our technology could address growing energy demands for electric vehicles by storing energy at low power from the grid and delivering it quickly and at high power to vehicles.

Certain car manufacturers are developing next-generation electric vehicles that may support extreme fast charging. This allows charging stations to operate at megawatt rates of charge ten times faster than the current Tesla superchargers, according to TransportXtra. At these rates, recharging an electric vehicle for a 300-mile (450 km) range would be possible in just five minutes. C-Ion technology is well suited for upgrading the power output of recharging stations where the grid infrastructure is limited.

Furthermore, governments and consumers are increasingly considering alternative energy storage solutions for a variety of reasons including better performance, deferring infrastructure upgrade costs, significantly lighter environmental impact, and lower maintenance and operating costs. Automakers such as Tesla, Inc. have demonstrated that premium EVs can deliver a compelling alternative to fossil fuels. As EVs become more competitive and more affordable, we believe that they will continue to take market share from ICE vehicles.

Our Growth Strategy 

Continue to Develop our Gen4 Carbon-ion technology

We will continue developing our carbon-ion technology with the goal of beginning transfer to commercial production in the first half of 2025. We have evaluated each of the elements required for initial success and calculated the high performance which we expect from their combination. We are now working to combine and optimize all components of the cell. We will then further develop volume manufacturing processes to enable high volume manufacturing and minimize manufacturing costs. As can be seen below Gen4 (and subsequently 4.1, 4.2) development activities represent a significant improvement over the existing technology, Gen 3.Strategic Partnerships.


Benefits of Our Technology 

C-ion technology is being developed to enable significant benefits across super capacitor capacity, cycle life, cell safety, unit cost and charging speed. We believe these benefits will provide significant value to customers and enable greater customer adoption by addressing key metrics, filling technology gaps and enabling mass market adoption of a wider range of energy storage solutions:
Right Sizing (Energy for Energy, Power for Power). Our cell design is intended to significantly increase volumetric energy density over traditional supercapacitor cells. By eliminating as much inactive material as possible at a cell level, energy storage is maximised - initially increasing volumetric energy by around 50%. Technology strategy is then targeted to further, similar increases with each subsequent development cycle. These high-power devices have a longer duration than conventional supercapacitors and can thus be used in a wider range of circumstances. 

Increased safety. Our cells use a non-flammable, non-toxic electrolyte and are designed to be stable to a wide range of temperature (-40 to 80 degrees Celsius). A nail penetration test was carried out and shows no reaction in the case of a Gen3 cell, we expect this to be no different for Gen4. Many other supercapacitors use solvents such as Acetonitrile (Methyl Cyanide) in their electrolytes which are flammable and harmful. 


-9-

Cost. Our technology is being developed for mass manufacture and using materials which provide value for money. Enabling mass market adoption will bring with it the economies of scale necessary to provide cost effective solutions in a range of markets. As a hybrid system, the extra longevity of battery components within the hybrid can lower the total cost of ownership. When our technology is used to buffer inadequate infrastructure, cost can be saved in deferring upgrades.

Cycle life. The inherently longer cycle life of electrostatic vs electrochemical energy storage gives an opportunity for longer life of systems either through hybridisation or alone. The extra energy storage afforded by C-Ion cells gives an advantage over some supercapacitors in that fewer cycles are needed for the same energy transferred, thus increasing lifetime of systems.

Strategic Partnerships.

Form key strategic research partnerships to seed the development of enabling technologies for future product generations. Where it provides good value for our shareholders, we will seek to capture intellectual property from these relationships. This kind of external innovation programme not only provides benefits in terms of the creating of new intellectual property but also enables thought leadership and encourages doctoral students to be trained in areas relevant for Carbon-Ion, providing a workforce for the future.

Commercially, a Chief Technical Strategist with particular experience in regional and national electrical grids has been brought on board to explore strategic relationships with a range of stakeholders in electrical grids. This will provide input to our technology development and could yield strategic investments, orders etc.

Develop Solutions

Our technology is being designed to enable a variety of business models, but must gain a good understanding of the total cost of ownership and management of hybrid systems. In addition to scientific research we will also undertake applications engineering and energy management development at a fundamental level in order to better understand, and meet, customer needs. Where appropriate, we may build and sell cell layers rather than complete cells.
Expand Target Markets

In addition to grid market development through our Chief Technical Strategist, we are entering into discussions with stakeholders in autonomous electric vehicles, aerospace, shipping, and mass transit and will continue to gather information from these sources in order to present compelling propositions to these markets. Should any market propositions prove compelling, we will engage sales and marketing professionals with particular expertise in that field to work on our behalf.
Employees

We currently have a team of eight (8) scientists, engineers, and other staff. We are also being assisted by third-party contractors that are providing additional support. We expect to expand our management and the product and intellectual-property development teams substantially after the close of this Offering to maintain more control over the development of our products to meet our business plans.
Intellectual Property

On December 10, 2020, COUV signed a binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter of Intent”) to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Oxcion Limited (the “Acquisition”), an entity incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales (Registration Number 06826090) (“Oxcion”), which was formerly known as Solutions for Start Up Ventures Limited (“Solutions”), and the owner of the ongoing business and assets of Zapgo Limited, including S (the “Zapgo Assets”), which are listed herein on Exhibit A. 

The Company was formed as a special purpose vehicle by the shareholders of Oxcion to acquire the Zapgo Assets. The Company assumed the right to complete the acquisition of the Zapgo Assets. The Company and COUV pursuant to which the original shareholders of Carbon Ion (the “Carbon-Ion Shareholders”) exchanged their shares for shares in COUV.[1]

The original Zapgo technology includes multi-layer supercapacitor cells made on commercial Li-Ion battery manufacturing lines (for Mobile phone and EV batteries) in commercially relevant sizes (again Phone/EV). Our focus has been to produce core intellectual property with a focus on nano-carbons, electrolyte, and integration of C-ion, which has resulted in high density super capacitors and high voltage super capacitors. 
___________________________________
1The Share Exchange Agreement provided that the Carbon-Ion Shareholders received the following shares in COUV (i) 100,000 shares of Series D preferred stock, and (ii) 100,000,000 shares of common stock.

In the next phase of development, we intend to focus on the following initiatives:


i. | Self-supporting electrodes, which allow separation of current collection and physical stability in the manufacturing process; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Gel electrolytes, which improve energy density and safe in the cell; 
iii. | New manufacturing routes, which will combine well known, high volume processes in a novel way to bring down manufacturing costs; and
iv. | Continued improvements in pseudo capacitance, which creates future innovations for new technologies; 


Our Milton Park, Abingdon Laboratory and engineering facility (currently being fitted out) has been designed to serve these purposes. First, the laboratory and engineering facility provides a sufficient quantity of super capacitor cells for internal development. And, second, our Milton Park, Abingdon is being built to have small scale manufacturing technology elements which can be configured to develop scalable new processes. This provides the basis for limited at scale manufacturing process development with third parties at Pilot Facilities. Without this capability, retention of intellectual property in manufacture would be difficult or costly and so any delays in the successful buildout of our facility may impact both our development and timelines.

Capturing our forecasted cost (performance) advantage at scale as compared to conventional super capacitor cells will require our team to continue process development to achieve rates of throughput, use of electricity and consumables, yield, and rate of automation demonstrated of mature super capacitor manufacturing processes. Notably, removal of water is a process step in carbon-ion manufacturing critical to both quality and product cost. We believe achieving required process cost advances is possible; our processes are designed around some tools which are already used at scale in the battery industries with the addition of alternative processing methods that may further increase the capital efficiency of the process. However, delay or failure on these fronts, and in particular with respect to water removal, would result in a higher cost of goods sold, which may limit our ability to profitably sell our super capacitors. 

We intend to protect and enhance the proprietary technology and inventions that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position through a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and globally, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and internal procedures. Our commercial success will depend, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies and all respective rights to such intellectual property and proprietary technologies therein.

As of the date hereof, our patent portfolio, including the Zapgo Patents, consists of over 100 patents that have been filed worldwide, of which over 30 have been granted. Below is a breakdown of patents filed and granted by jurisdiction.

Our issued patents will expire commencing in 2031. In addition, we plan to continue expanding and strengthening our IP portfolio with additional patent applications in the future. The research and development team returned to work on April 1, 2021, after having been on furlough during the COVID-19 pandemic. This team has focused on our technical expertise and identified over twenty (20) areas of interest where we now intend to file for numerous additional patents, subject to availability of sufficient funding. During this exercise we identified over forty (40) areas of ‘know-how,’ with particular emphasis on manufacturing and performance.

We may not be able to obtain protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future patents, trademarks, know-how, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. Our pending patent applications and future applications may not result in the issuance of patents, and any resulting issued patents may have claims narrower than those in our patent applications. Additionally, our current and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented, or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Our internal controls may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technologies.

Other companies that own patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights related to our technology-related industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property or other rights. Third parties, including our competitors, may make claims from time to time that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights. As our business grows and competition rises, the risk of facing claims related to intellectual property and litigation matters will likely increase.

Competition

In order to differentiate our Company from competitors, we will work in the following ways and according to the following principles:


· | Targeting best in class supercapacitor energy density without adding Lithium In order to differentiate our Company from competitors, our goal is to develop a new cell architecture which increases energy density compared to its current supercapacitor (already high in this field) and introduce new material combinations to boost this further. Our technology approach should maintain high cycle life and safety characteristics while storing progressively more energy per unit volume. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | High barriers to entry and extensive patent and intellectual property portfolio. Since inception, we have generated more than 100 patents and patent applications – including patents around our core technology and patents around application of technology. We have a range of patents/applications, including nano-carbons, electrode structures, cell operation and applications of our technology. A portfolio of future filings is already planned covering those topics and additionally manufacturing, hybridization, battery management, conditioning and others.

· | Strong network within battery and electrochemical communities. Being located in Oxfordshire, combined with strong networks in the Midlands and London give our R&D personnel the contacts and partnerships to find new collaborators and talent. The previous UK business collaborated with the likes of Oxford University, Imperial College London and Williams Advanced Engineering and Warwick Manufacturing Group (among others). Former staff can be found in other exciting energy storage businesses and communicate regularly with current team members.

· | Designed for volume production. Our cells are designed to use materials and processes suitable for high volume production. While our Gen3 technology was designed to be made on a Lithium ion production line, Gen4 will include higher volume elements from other industries in order to reduce cost and increase quality and throughput. An increased level of automation should be possible, allowing a very wide range of geographies to be attractive for manufacture. The addition of different processes is expected to provide a range of novel intellectual property.
· | Hybridization driving Industry cost trends. As we have discussed, hybridization using C-Ion cells could unlock far wider and faster adoption of novel energy storage technologies. This in turn could not only reduce costs through the larger size of that market but also dramatically reduce the cost of new energy storage technologies in the way we have seen with Lithium Ion technology. 


There are currently several companies that are focused on the development of supercapacitors, and we expect several more competitors to enter into this market in the next few years. These competitors include Maxwell Technologies, Skeleton Technologies, Superdielectrics and NAWA Technologies. Many other companies develop or manufacture supercapacitors as part of a wider range of electronic components or batteries and also form part of the competitive landscape for the Company. 

Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and stability, larger customer bases and significantly greater technical, sales, and marketing, and other resources than us. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally. Being a technology forward company, continued advancements, innovative new services, and new products from other competitors that are introduced may reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Despite our differentiators, increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business. 

Process Development 

Though our C-ion design is unique, its manufacturing relies on well-established, high-volume production processes currently deployed globally in other industries at large scale. We plan to outsource to OEM’s to manufacture cells, but will develop the process to a point which retains significant intellectual property. 
Government Regulation and Compliance

There are government regulations mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, disposal of batteries and to some extent this also pertains super capacitors. We will comply with these regulations if we sell our supercapacitor into the U.S. market and have confidence that the ability to fully discharge our cells and their non-flammable, non-toxic electrolyte components will make this process more straightforward than for Lithium containing cells. Hybrid systems will, of course, comply fully with all applicable safety, transportation and disposal requirements. The license and sale of our super capacitor abroad may be the subject to export regulations in the future.
Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11 employees, based primarily in our R&D Facility in Abingdon, Oxfordshire UK. Over 10 of those employees are engaged in research and development and related functions, and more than three quarters of these employees hold engineering and scientific degrees at postgraduate level.

We value diversity as a key enabler of novel thinking and recognize the importance of building a positive, inclusive culture to achieve a diverse and innovative workforce. Our human resource strategy is centered around the retention and development of employees which is necessary to achieve our stated aims.
