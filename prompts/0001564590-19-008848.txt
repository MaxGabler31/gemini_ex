Our Company
 
CorePoint is a leading owner in the mid-scale and upper mid-scale select service hotel space, primarily under the La Quinta brand. We believe we are the only publicly traded REIT with hotel investments focused solely on the midscale and upper midscale select-service segment of the lodging industry. Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, consisted of 315 hotels representing approximately 40,400 rooms across 41 U.S. states in attractive locations in or near employment centers, airports, and major travel thoroughfares. All but one of our hotels is wholly-owned. We primarily derive our revenues from our hotel operations.
 We intend to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”), effective May 31, 2018, with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2018, and currently qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. See “— REIT Qualification” below.

 Spin-Off from LQH
 On May 30, 2018, LQH Parent completed the separation of its hotel ownership business from its hotel franchise and hotel management business by spinning off LQH’s hotel ownership business as a stand-alone, publicly traded company, CorePoint Parent.  Subsequently, LQH Parent, which held LQH’s hotel franchise and hotel management business, merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham Worldwide (the “Merger”).  In conjunction with the Spin-Off, CorePoint entered into separate hotel management agreements with LQ Management L.L.C. (“LQM”) and separate hotel franchise agreements with La Quinta Franchising LLC (“LQ Franchising”).  See “– Our Principal Operating Agreements.”

Wyndham Worldwide transition and integration
 
In connection with the agreements we entered into with La Quinta, our hotels became a part of the management and franchise platforms of Wyndham Worldwide, and we are pro-actively engaged in the related transition and integration. This includes:
 
 
• | accessing Wyndham Worldwide’s distribution network including Wyndham.com, contact centers and loyalty platform to potentially increase market share at a more cost-effective customer acquisition cost;
• | technology and system integrations for property management, reservation systems and revenue management, which could expand our asset management effectiveness; and 
• | gross margin initiatives related to labor, procurement and other service deliveries. 

 We are in regular communication with La Quinta and are actively monitoring our progress. We expect the technology components, which are a part of Wyndham Worldwide’s technology upgrade, to be completed in the first half of 2019. Accordingly, we believe the major components of this transition will be completed during 2019; however, given the dynamics of the lodging sector and ever-changing technology, marketing and revenue enhancing opportunities, the impact on our operations and the interaction with our property manager will continuously be evolving.
 Our Properties
 As an owner of hotels, we can capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand or ADR. The cost structure of our typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and ADR increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. Hotel ownership is capital intensive, as we are responsible for the costs and capital expenditures for our hotels. The profits realized by us are generally significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues. 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate additional capital projects such as accelerating renovation cycles for our hotels, and we seek to invest in those projects that we believe will provide an appropriate return on capital invested and increase RevPAR and gross margin. 
 In 2016, LQH Parent undertook a review of its owned hotel portfolio and identified 54 properties that, with the appropriate scope of capital investment and renovation, LQH Parent believed would have the opportunity to re-position upwards within a market, capturing additional occupancy and rate increases while being measured against new, higher-quality competitive sets. As of December 31, 2018, the construction phase of the repositioning effort had been completed for 53 of these hotels. The capital expenditures related to such repositioning during 2018 were approximately $61 million. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a strategic review of our hotel portfolio with the goal of improving operating performance and increasing our net asset valuation. Our initial focus is on our lowest performing hotels, where we are evaluating opportunities to increase gross margin, net cash flow and return on investment. These include initiatives to increase revenue from access to the Wyndham distribution platform and to control variable expenses while still maintaining appropriate guest satisfaction levels. We are also evaluating whether the disposition of certain hotels could result in superior value creation over the long term.
 Because of differences in ADR, operating expenses, gross margin and capital investment, we typically group our hotels by interior or exterior corridor and by inns or inns and suites.  The table below sets forth the number of hotels and rooms with these groupings for each of the last three years:
 
 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
-------------------------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+-----
Number of Hotels in Operation | | | | | | 
La Quinta Inn & Suites (interior corridor) | | 181 | | 182 | | 180
La Quinta Inn & Suites (exterior corridor) | | 3 | | 3 | | 3 
La Quinta Inns (interior corridor) | | 41 | | 41 | | 46 
La Quinta Inns (exterior corridor) | | 89 | | 91 | | 93 
Baymont Inns (exterior corridor) | | 1 | | — | | — 
Total Hotels | | 315 | | 317 | | 322

Our reported weighted average ADR and occupancy by hotel category for the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows:
  
 | ADR | | Occupancy
-------------------------------------------+-----+-------+----------
La Quinta Inn & Suites (interior corridor) | $ | 97.06 | | 67 | %
La Quinta Inn & Suites (exterior corridor) | $ | 99.03 | | 69 | %
La Quinta Inns (interior corridor) | $ | 73.69 | | 60 | %
La Quinta Inns (exterior corridor) | $ | 79.55 | | 63 | %
Baymont Inns (exterior corridor) | $ | 60.22 | | 45 | %

 
Our reported weighted average ADR and occupancy by chain scale for the year ended December 31, 2018 are as follows:
 
 
 | Number of Hotels | | ADR | | | Occupancy
---------------+------------------+-----+-----+---+--------+----------
Upper upscale | | 5 | | $ | 182.75 | | 74.4 | %
Upscale | | 21 | | $ | 130.76 | | 72.0 | %
Upper midscale | | 62 | | $ | 103.39 | | 69.1 | %
Midscale | | 151 | | $ | 83.11 | | 65.3 | %
Economy | | 76 | | $ | 62.75 | | 58.7 | %

 The following table summarizes our key operating statistics for our comparable hotels, as of December 31, 2018, for each of the last three years:

  
 | As of and for the year ended December 31, | 
----------+-------------------------------------------+------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016
Occupancy | | 65.5 | % | | | 64.9 | % | | 65.5 | %
ADR | $ | 89.62 | | | $ | 86.33 | | $ | 85.51 | 
RevPAR | $ | 58.67 | | | $ | 56.05 | | $ | 56.02 | 

 
The increases noted in 2018 were primarily due to the positive effects from our repositioning initiatives as discussed above.
 
We own our hotels through wholly-owned subsidiaries except for one hotel, which is owned by a joint venture in which we own a controlling interest. Generally, our hotels include the land, related easements and rights, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment.  For 18 of our hotels, the hotels are located on land leased by us pursuant to ground leases with third parties.
 
Brand Affiliation
 
All but one of our hotels currently operates under La Quinta’s highly recognizable select-service hotel brand.  We believe our properties derive significant value from their affiliation with the La Quinta brand and benefit from the operational expertise, extensive distribution network, strong commercial engines and additional resources of one of the nation’s fastest growing select-service hotel brands.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we are obligated to re-flag three hotels currently operating under the La Quinta brand due to the completion of nearby competing hotels in La Quinta’s franchisee pipeline.  An additional 18 of our hotels currently operating under the La Quinta brand have been identified as potential conflicting facilities and may, in the future, be re-flagged to operate under another Wyndham brand.
 
Our Business, Growth and Financing Strategies 
 
Our objective is to generate favorable long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders through disciplined capital allocation, maintaining balance sheet strength, proactive asset management and enhancing the value of our properties. We intend to pursue this objective through the following strategies: 

• | Disciplined capital allocation. We are a pure-play lodging REIT strategically focused on the midscale and upper midscale select-service lodging segments. The midscale and upper midscale segments are among the largest segments of the lodging industry by property count. In addition, these segments are highly fragmented. We believe there is a significant opportunity to acquire hotels from smaller owner operators, particularly owners with a higher cost of capital. We may implement strategies to develop a disciplined acquisition strategy which would allow us to expand our presence in target markets and further diversify over time, including through the acquisition of hotels that are affiliated with other respected hotel brands and operators.

• | Build and Maintain a Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet. We seek to build and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet that will have a mix of debt that will provide us with the liquidity to prepay when desired, dispose of assets, pursue our value enhancement strategies within our existing portfolio, support acquisition activity and maintain a sustainable well-covered dividend. Additionally, we expect to reduce our leverage over time, which will provide additional balance sheet flexibility. We will also focus on preserving sufficient liquidity with minimal short-dated debt maturities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximizing Hotel Profitability through Proactive Asset Management. We are focused on continually improving the operating performance, profitability and cash flow of each of our hotels through our proactive asset management. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced an evaluation of CorePoint’s hotel portfolio to identify opportunities to expand profit margins and improve overall performance. As we look ahead, our team intends to focus on strategic initiatives that we believe will enhance potential of our diverse portfolio and improve results. We are executing an asset management strategy that includes working closely with our manager to improve the operational performance of CorePoint’s portfolio, especially in our underperforming hotels, and working to leverage their broad distribution network and infrastructure. We collaborate with our third-party managers to identify opportunities to increase market share, employ active revenue management strategies increase our ADR and occupancy and improve gross margins, thereby enhancing the operating performance, cash flow and value of each property. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identifying and Executing Value-Enhancing Investments. We have a demonstrated record of identifying and executing on value enhancing opportunities in our properties. As an example, in 2016, we reviewed our hotel portfolio and identified 54 properties that, with the appropriate scope of capital investment and renovation, had the opportunity to be repositioned upwards within their relevant market, which we believed would capture occupancy and additional rate. During 2018, these repositioned hotels produced an approximately 15% increase in RevPAR as compared to 2017. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a strategic review of our hotel portfolio with the goal of improving operating performance and results. Our initial focus is on our lowest performing hotels, where we are evaluating opportunities to increase gross margin, net cash flow and return on investment. These include initiatives to increase revenue from access to the Wyndham Worldwide distribution platform and to control variable expenses while still maintaining appropriate guest satisfaction levels. We also may create value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities to ensure our assets achieve their highest and best use. Concurrently, we are evaluating whether the disposition of certain hotels could result in a superior value creation outcome. Further, we are continually focused on maintaining our properties and adapting to evolving customer preferences by making ongoing capital expenditures that will provide an acceptable return on investment.

Our Principal Operating Agreements
 
Management Agreements
 
On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel management agreements with LQM whereby we pay a fee equal to 5% of total gross revenues, as defined. Our management fee expense for the partial period of May 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was $26 million.
 
LQM generally has sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. LQM also provides all employees for the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels.  We have consultative and limited approval rights with respect to certain actions of LQM, including entering into long-term or high value contracts, engaging in certain actions relating to legal proceedings, approving the operating budget, making certain capital expenditures and the hiring of certain management personnel.  We are also responsible for reimbursing LQM for certain costs incurred by LQM during the fulfillment of their duties, such as payroll costs for certain employees and other costs that the manager incurs to operate the hotels.  The term of the management agreements is through 2038, subject to two renewals of five years each, at LQM’s option.  There are penalties for early termination.
 
Franchise Agreements
 
On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel franchise agreements with LQ Franchising, each with an initial term of 20 years. As franchisee, 12 to 24 months prior to initial expiration of the applicable franchise agreement, we have the opportunity to request a renewal term of an additional ten years by notice to the franchisor, payment of a renewal fee and execution of the franchisor’s then current form of franchise agreement.  The franchisor then has 60 days to make a determination whether to renew.  There are also penalties for early termination; however, both we and the franchisor have the option to cancel the franchise agreements 
 8

in 2033, the 15th year anniversary, with no penalty to either party. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we were granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use our franchisor’s brand names, marks and system in the operation of our hotels.  The franchisor also may provide us with a variety of services and benefits, including centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness as well as training of personnel.  In return we are required to operate our hotels consistent with the applicable brand standards.  As of December 31, 2018, 314 of our franchise agreements were with LQ Franchising.
 
Our franchise agreements require that we pay a 5% royalty fee on gross room revenues.  
 
In addition to the royalty fee, the LQ Franchising agreement includes a reservation fee of 2% of gross room revenues, a marketing fee of 2.5% of gross room revenues, a loyalty program fee of 5% of eligible room night revenue, and other miscellaneous ancillary fees.  Reservation fees are included within room expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  The marketing fee and loyalty program fees are included within other departmental and support in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
 
Our total royalty and other franchise fee expense for the partial period from May 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was $68 million.
 
Our requirement to meet certain brand standards imposed by our franchisor includes requirements that we incur certain capital expenditures, generally ranging from $1,500 to $7,500 per hotel room (with various specific amounts within this range being applicable to different groups of our hotels) during a prescribed period generally ranging from two to eleven years.  These amounts are over and above the capital expenditures we are required to make each year for recurring furniture, fixtures and equipment maintenance.  However, these amounts that we are required to spend are subject to reduction, in varying degrees, by the amount of capital expenditures made for hotels in the applicable group over and above the capital expenditures required for recurring maintenance in one or more years before receipt of the franchisor’s notice. The initial period during which the franchisor can notify us that we must make these capital expenditures is through 2028. At the franchisor’s discretion, subject to the franchise agreement provisions governing when such requirements may be imposed, the franchisor may provide a notice obligating us to meet those capital expenditure requirements generally within two to nine years of the notice. As of December 31, 2018, no such notices have been received; however, approximately 63% of our hotels are potentially eligible for such capital expenditure requirements. Through 2028, our remaining hotels will become eligible for such notices and capital expenditure requirements. We expect to meet these requirements primarily through our recurring capital expenditure program.
 
In connection with the sale of a hotel, where the buyer is assuming the franchise agreement, the franchise agreements provide certain obligations for the buyer which may affect the terms of our hotel sales. These provisions include the franchisor’s approval of the buyer, transfer fees and capital expenditure assessments to meet the franchisor’s current brand standards.
 
Ground Leases
 
We maintain ground lease arrangements with third parties for 18 hotel properties that generally contain base rent and contingent rent provisions based upon the respective hotel’s revenues.  Many of these lease agreements contain renewal options at fair market value at the conclusion of the initial lease term.  The leases extend for varying periods through 2096.  Our ground lease rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $5 million. We are also responsible for property taxes associated with the land parcel.
 
Our ground leases are generally assumable by a hotel buyer in the event of a sale.  Our current debt agreements require us to exercise any ground lease renewals during the term of the debt.
 
Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018 we employed 33 people. We believe our employee relations are positive.
 
Although not employed by us, our hotels are operated by employees who are employed by our hotel manager, pursuant to our management agreements. Our hotel manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels, including setting compensation amounts, benefits and other labor arrangements.  These expe
nses are generally reimbursed by us under the terms of the relevant management agreement. Accordingly, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor, which may affect our hotel manager’s staffing requirements and overall staffing expenses. As of December 31, 2018, our hotel manager’s employees at two of our hotels were represented by labor unions.  In March 2019, the union ratified agreements with our hotel manager for both hotels.  We believe relations are positive between our hotel manager and its employees at our hotels.

For additional discussion of these relationships and risks associated with our hotel manager’s employees, refer to the section below “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”
 Competition
 The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests on the basis of several factors, including the attractiveness of the facility, location, room rate, quality of accommodations, public and meeting spaces, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands primarily in the mid-scale and upper mid-scale select service segments. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. We believe our hotels enjoy certain competitive advantages as a result of being flagged with nationally recognized brands, including access to centralized reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, strong hotel management expertise and guest loyalty programs.
 
Our principal competitors include hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including other lodging REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We have also seen the emergence of a sharing economy with the increasing availability of online short-term rentals.  We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity investors, institutional pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and numerous local, regional and national owners, including franchisors, in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.
 
Seasonality and Cyclicality
 
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature. Generally, our revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. The timing of holidays, local special events and weekends can also impact our quarterly results. The periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property and depend principally upon location. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, net earnings and cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, our quarterly results may be adversely affected by the timing of certain of our marketing production and maintenance expenditures. Further, the timing of opening of newly constructed or renovated hotels and the timing of any hotel acquisitions or dispositions may cause a variation of revenue and earnings from quarter to quarter.
 
In addition, the hotel industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic factors.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our hotels include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our hotels. We are required to have operations and maintenance plans that seek to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our hotels, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

REIT Qualification 
 
Following our Spin-Off, we believe that we are organized in conformity with and operate in a manner that will allow us to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes during our tax year ended December 31, 2018, and we expect to continue to be organized and operate so as to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To the extent we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on taxable income generated by our REIT activities that we distribute to our stockholders. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. Refer to “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.”
 

Regulation
 
The hotel industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations in the United States, including those relating to hospitality ordinances, data security, health and safety, building codes and zoning requirements. Hotels and their owners and operators are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing their relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our hotels, we may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state and local regulations. Any failure to obtain or maintain any such licenses or any publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of any such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property (including business interruption), terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our hotels. Certain of these insurance coverages are provided through policies obtained by our manager, primarily related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability, where we are identified as a co-insured party.  Through all of these policies, our insurance provides coverage related to claims arising out of the operations of our hotels, where most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles, subject to the terms and limits of the policies.
Corporate History
 
CorePoint Lodging Inc. was incorporated in Maryland on May 8, 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of LQH Parent. As described above under “Spin-Off from LQH,” the Company was spun off from LQH Parent on May 30, 2018 and began trading “regular way” on the NYSE on May 31, 2018.
