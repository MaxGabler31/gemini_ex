(“Illumination”), consummated the acquisition of Grom Holdings, Inc. (“Grom Holdings”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange”) that was entered into on May 15, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized capital to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, as well as to change its name to “Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.” At the closing of the Share Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 110,853,883 shares of its common stock to the Grom Holdings shareholders, pro rata to their respective ownership percentage.

As a result, the stockholders of Grom Holdings are now stockholders of the Company and own approximately 92% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
All references to common share totals or values in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) unless otherwise stated, have been adjusted, retroactively, to reflect the Share Exchange ratio of 4.17 as of August 17, 2017.

Grom Social
 
Grom Social is a social media company for kids focused on producing original content and generating revenue from our website and synergistic subsidiary companies. Although we have only generated minimal revenue to date, our core business is our Grom Social media website for children, which we refer to as “Grom Social.” The concept for Grom Social was developed in 2012, by Zach Marks, who was 12 years old at the time and is the son of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Darren Marks.
 
The name “Grom,” is derived from Australian surfing slang, and is defined by us to mean “a promising young individual who is quick to learn.” Visitors to our Grom Social website located at www.gromsocial.com may log on via mobile phone, desktop computer or tablet and chat with friends, view original content or play games created by us.
 
Grom Social’s business model is based upon providing children ages five through 16 with a safe environment on the Internet while promoting “fun,” “wholesomeness” and “family values.” Since inception, we have generated in excess of 7.0 million users, in over 200 countries and territories. We define a "user" as any child between the ages of 5 and 16 who sign up for a Grom Social account. We require that each child receive parental approval to gain full access to the Grom Social platform. In certain jurisdictions and circumstances, we allow parents, teachers, and guardians (collectively, “parents”) to sign up groups of children at one time. As a result, we have a grand total in excess of 14.0 million individuals in our database that we can contact and potentially monetize in the future, although there can be no assurances.
 
We communicate with our database both actively, through email and a parent portal; and passively, through messaging on the child’s profile page and through seventeen unique Grom characters. Additionally, we have the ability to communicate with users and parents regardless of where they may be navigating on our Grom Social website. We have established the following safeguards and procedures to ensure that above all else, Grom Social is a safe place for children:
 

· | Account Approval: We have set up our account creation procedures to help ensure that only children between the ages of five and 16 can create an account on Grom Social. According to our procedures, if a child submits a request to open an account on Grom Social, we send a notification to his or her parents by email that their child has applied to create a Grom Social account. If the child’s parents approve the account, by using one of three methods that are approved by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, guidelines, the account is opened. If a parent’s approval is not given, the account will not be opened, and the child will have limited access to the Grom Social website.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Parental Involvement: By requiring parental approval to for a child open an account and to enable the child to interact with other users on Grom Social, we hope to ensure that the parents are aware of and involved with Grom Social and their child’s activity on the site. Further, we believe that parental involvement provides us with the ability to market products and services to parents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Content Monitoring: We have software that monitors posts for inappropriate content using standard “key word” filter technology. If a post contains inappropriate content, it will not appear on the website and the poster will be sent a warning about offensive content. We believe that through monitoring content we can promote social responsibility and digital citizenship.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anti-bullying: We have software that monitors Grom Social for bullying. In addition to monitoring the interaction between children on the website, we also post messages on Grom Social that strongly emphasizes anti-bullying and actively promotes social responsibility and digital citizenship. Additionally, our website has received the “KidSafe Seal of Approval”. The kidSAFE Seal Program is an independent safety certification service and seal-of-approval program designed exclusively for children-friendly websites and technologies, including online game sites, educational services, virtual worlds, social networks, mobile apps, tablet devices, connected toys, and other similar online and interactive services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Use of “Gromatars”: Children on Grom Social create animated pictures, which we call “Gromatars,” to represent themselves on Grom Social without providing a real-life photo of themselves. Gromatars are viewed as profile pictures on a user’s home wall, and it’s what other user’s see when the user leaves a comment or “like” on a public page. Kids can build and customize their Gromatars by selecting over 200 different options such as the eyes, nose, hair, teeth, ears, skin color, hair style and color, etc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe these safeguards are a critical component of our business model. We believe that children are increasingly accessing the internet at younger and younger ages and therefore, the need for safe, age appropriate web venues for younger children to browse and interact with other children is increasing. According to statistics compiled from several sources over the past few years on GuardChild.com (“GuardChild”), an organization focused on providing software and applications to promote safe Internet browsing for children:
 

· | Approximately 81% of online 9-17 old’s say they visited a social networking site in the past three months;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approximately 41% of teens had a negative experience as a result of using a social networking site; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approximately 88% of teens have seen someone be “mean or cruel” to another person on a social networking site.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content
 
In addition to providing a safe, social media platform for children to interact with their peers, we create our own content for Grom Social consisting of animated characters we created, interactive chats, videos, blogs, and games only available on Grom Social. We believe that the content that we produce for Grom Social meets our goals of providing wholesome family entertainment.

According to Google Analytics, as of November 2016, the average online duration of an Internet user is approximately 18 minutes. Based upon the login statistics for Grom Social, the average online duration of users logged onto Grom Social is approximately 50.4 minutes. We believe the longer duration time is a result of our ability to better engage users through our original content.
 
Monetizing strategy
 
Since Grom Social’s inception in 2012 through the date of this Annual Report, we have been focused on growing our user base and in developing original content, technology, branding and marketing the “Grom” name. As a result of our focus on growing our user base instead of monetizing advertisements or subscription programs, Grom Social generated less than $20,000 in revenues in 2017.
 
While no assurances can be provided, we believe we now have the infrastructure, tools and access to funding to begin to generate meaningful revenues from Grom Social. We hope to generate revenues from Grom Social from the following sources:
 

· | Subscription Based Premium Content. We are continuously making software upgrades which will enable us to offer premium “VIP” content to users for which they will be charged a monthly subscription fee. Users that sign up for this VIP program will become Grom Club Members. We expect to be able to offer Grom Club Memberships during the fourth quarter of 2018. Grom Club Members will be able to:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Create and view interactive videos they can share with other Grom Club Members, with non-paying Grom users and with any other third parties;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive exclusive Gromatar options and accessories;
--+----------------------------------------------------


Ø | Have unlimited access to premium games;
--+----------------------------------------


Ø | Receive free monthly desktop screen savers and animated gifts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Engage in exclusive chats with athletes;
--+-----------------------------------------


Ø | Collaborate with Zach and other Grom Club Members with similar interests to create new Grom Social features;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


Ø | Earn and collect “Grom Coin Packages” that can be used to purchase merchandise, play games or purchase other exclusive content on the Grom Social website. Grom Club Members will earn Grom Coin Packages by participating in activities on Grom Social; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Receive discounts on Grom merchandise.
--+---------------------------------------


· | Advertising Revenue. We believe the growing size of our database of children and parents will attract several high-profile companies to advertise on our Grom Social website and mobile platforms. In addition, we intend to emphasize to advertisers what we believe is the unique level of parental involvement on Grom Social. We have been approached by numerous entities to advertise on the Grom Social website and have one program in early non-revenue testing. We expect to enter into an agreement with an advertiser during the third quarter of 2018 and intend to charge each advertiser a fee and/or commission to advertise a particular brand/product or service on our platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Longer Term Revenue Opportunities. In addition to the foregoing near term initiatives, we expect to add the following features to Grom Social to generate revenue:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Online Game Fees. The games currently available to users on Grom Social are free. We intend to offer Grom Social users an option to pay to play exclusive games and/or pay for game upgrades. These games may be developed by us, such as Grom Skate or obtained from outside developers, and adapted to use on Grom Social.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Licensing Merchandise Revenue. We believe we will generate merchandise revenue when members purchase Grom apparel and other goods through our website and mobile app. We also anticipate entering into Grom licensing and merchandise agreements.

Recent Developments
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
During 2016 and 2017 we made several significant acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is to acquire synergistic companies, products or intellectual property that will help grow our Grom Social user base and also will become profitable as a stand-alone enterprise or division within the company without the benefit of intercompany. In that regard, during 2016 and 2017 we made four acquisitions that meet those criteria:
 
Acquisition of TD Holdings Limited
 
On July 1, 2016, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of TD Holdings, which is incorporated in Hong Kong. Its operations are conducted through its subsidiary companies, TDAHK and TDA. The group’s principal activities, based in Manila, Philippines, are the production of animated films. TDA is a full-service production and pre-production studio working with leading international clients.
 
In connection with our acquisition of TD Holdings, we paid $4,000,000 in cash, issued a 5% Promissory Note, in the principal amount of $4,000,000 (the “Note”) to the selling shareholders of TDA (“TDA Sellers”) maturing on July 1, 2018. Additionally, we issued 7,367,001 shares of our restricted common stock to the TDA Sellers valued at $4,240,000, or approximately $0.58 per share. Wayne Dearing, the founder and CEO of TD Holdings, and currently one of our executive officers was a 50% owner of TD Holdings. Accordingly, he received 50% of the purchase consideration that we paid (described above).
 
Additionally, under the terms of the acquisition, Grom is required to make additional payments to the TDA Sellers, up to a maximum of $5,000,000 (“Earnout Payments”), if TD Holdings achieves certain adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA Targets”) during the three-year period following the acquisition (the “Earnout Period”). The Earnout Payments, if any, will be paid 25% in cash and the balance in shares of common stock. The number of shares issuable shall be determined by using a share price equal to the lower of a 10% discount to our last private placement price per share prior to making the Earnout Payment, to a bona fide investor, and priced at arm’s length; or if the Buyer Shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange and publicly traded and not suspended, at a 10% discount to the previous 20 day weighted average closing price per share.
 
The applicable EBITDA Targets and Earnout Payments for each of the three years during the Earnout Period are as follows:
 

EBITDA Target | Earnout Payment
--------------+----------------
$2,400,000 | $1,666,667 
$3,700,000 | $3,333,333 

 
In the event that TD Holdings achieves an EBITDA in an Earnout Year greater than $2,400,000 but less than $3,700,000, the Earnout Payment is calculated by multiplying $3,333,333 by the sum of “A” divided by “B” where:
 
“A” equals the sum of $3,700,000 less the EBITDA earned; and
 “B” equals $1,300,000 (being the difference between $2,400,000 and $3,700,000).
 
The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that TD Holding’s EBITDA in any 12-month period during the Earnout Years is equal to or greater than $3,700,000, the full amount of the Earnout Payment will be paid one month after that EBITDA Target is achieved and no further Earnout Payments shall be made.
 
No earn out was achieved for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

We believe that TDA not only provides us with an important source of revenue, it also provides us with a source for animated content for Grom Social and for original shows that can be viewed on Grom Social. Although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in creating this animated content.
 
On January 3, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the acquisition agreement with the TDA Sellers (the “Amendment”):
 

· | The TDA Sellers agreed to extend the maturity date of the Note one year until July 1, 2019;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The interest rate on the Note during the one-year extension period from July 2, 2018 to July 1, 2019 was changed to 10%. The interest rate on the Note remained at 5%, payable annually in arrears, until June 30, 2018; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | During the one-year extension period, the interest will be paid quarterly in arrears, instead of annually in arrears. The first such quarterly interest payment of $100,000 is due on September 30, 2018; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Under the terms of the terms acquisition agreement, the Sellers had an opportunity to earn up to $5.0 million in contingent Earnout Payments (as describe above). The original Earn out measurement period ended on December 31, 2018. As part of the consideration for the Sellers agreeing to enter the Amendment, we agreed to extend the Earnout Period, one year, to December 31, 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also on January 3, 2018 as additional consideration, we issued an additional 800,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the TDA Sellers.
 
Acquisition of the MamaBear Mobile Software Application Assets of GeoWaggle, LLC (“MamaBear”) 
 
On September 30, 2016, we purchased an online application and website called “MamaBear” for 208,500 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $162,500, or approximately $0.78 per share. By using MamaBear, a parent can follow and protect their child’s online presence by monitoring their social networking/media accounts, including, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. MamaBear is intended to generate revenue through a paid subscription and advertising model. To date, the revenue generated by the MamaBear safety application has been nominal. On April 2, 2018, we launched an upgraded and enhanced version of the MamaBear application. We believe this upgrade will help generate significant revenue from this application although there can be no assurances.
 
Acquisition of the NetSpective Webfilter Assets and Software from TeleMate.net 
 
On January 1, 2017, we acquired the assets of NetSpective Webfilter (“NetSpective”), a division of TeleMate.net Software (“Telemate”). NetSpective sells proprietary Internet filtering software to over 3,700 schools and more than over 2 million children and generates revenue through a subscription model. NetSpective products comply with The Children's Internet Protection Act, or CIPA, which requires that K-12 schools and libraries in the United States use Internet filters and implement other technology protection measures to protect children from harmful online content as a condition for federal funding.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we paid $1,000,000 in consideration in the form of a $1,000,000 redeemable, convertible promissory note. The note bears interest at 0.68% per annum. All note principal and accrued interest is payable January 1, 2020. The note is convertible at the election of the sellers (the “Telemate Sellers”) into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of $0.78 per share. Furthermore, if not previously converted by the Sellers, the note may be converted by the Company into shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate of $0.48 per share commencing on November 1, 2019.
 
Additionally, the Telemate Sellers had the opportunity to achieve an earn-out payment of up to $362,500, payable 100% in our restricted common stock at a price of $0.78 per share or 464,744 shares, if NetSpective generated $362,500 in “net cash flow” as defined by the agreement during the one-year post-closing period ending December 31, 2017. The earn-out payments, if achieved, shall be payable entirely in common stock at the rate of $0.78 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash flow threshold necessary for Telemate to receive the full $362,500 earn out was achieved by NetSpective. However, TeleMate failed to remit $146,882 it had collected on our behalf from NetSpective customers. As a result of TeleMate’s non-payment and to avoid litigation, on January 12, 2018 we entered into a First Modification to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Modification”).

Under the terms of the Modification, the TeleMate Sellers agreed to the following terms:
 

· | To pay us $10,000 per month against their outstanding balance of $146,822. To date they have paid us $20,000 and are current on their monthly payment obligations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | They cannot exercise the conversion feature of their $1.0 million promissory note, nor will any of the $362,500 Earnout shares (464,744 shares) be issued, until the outstanding balance is paid in full, by TeleMate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The December 31, 2019 maturity date of the promissory is extended indefinitely until all payments are made in full.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All interest payments ($6,800 annually) due from the Company to the TeleMate Sellers was suspended indefinitely until all payments are made in full.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Finally, assuming all payments are made and the TeleMate Sellers decide to exercise the conversion feature of their promissory note, they are now bound by a leakout agreement which will limit for a one-year period the amount of shares they can register for sale on a monthly basis
 
Acquisition of the Assets of Fyoosion LLC 
 
On December 27, 2017, we consummated the acquisition of all of the assets of Fyoosion LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fyoosion”), which assets included goodwill, cash, accounts receivable, prepayments, patents, trademarks, source code, hardware appliances as well as all other documentation, processes, equipment and know how necessary to operate the seller’s business in a manner similar to its current operations.
 
Fyoosion’s proprietary software utilizes a digital automation marketing platform for businesses of all types to enable companies to efficiently generate sales leads and improve customer retention. We intend to use this marketing software with all our existing businesses and to create new opportunities outside our current scope of business.
 
In consideration for these assets we issued an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our common stock. These shares are subject to a leakout agreement limiting the number of shares that can be sold during the one-year period following the date of the agreement to 25% of the daily average trading volume during the period prior to such sale. The agreement also provides that up to an additional 200,000 shares of our “restricted” common shares can be earned and will become payable to Fyoosion or its assigns only if the proposed business utilizing the Assets attains $125,000 in pre-tax earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) calculated using generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the one-year period post-closing. This calculation shall be based upon Fyoosion stand-alone performance excluding any of our intercompany revenue and expense and will not include any corporate fees or charges.
 
Business Strategy 
 
In 2017 and 2016, we generated net sales of $8.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our growth from 2016 to 2017 came from acquisitions.
 
We intend to continue grow our business through a combination of aggressive marketing initiatives and synergistic acquisitions through which we can increase our Grom Social user base to a large enough size to enable us to attract advertisers and paid users for our VIP content. Additionally, as described in this Annual Report, in December 2017 we consummated the acquisition of Fyoosion which utilizes proprietary software and marketing applications for businesses of all types to enable companies to efficiently generate sales leads and improve customer retention. We intend to use this marketing software with all our existing businesses and to create new revenue opportunities outside our current scope of business. Additionally, we intend to use other methods such as direct sales calls, industry and other trade shows along with other methods. There can be no assurance that our strategy will result in additional revenues.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy is as follows:
 
·         Increase the size of our database of user at Grom Social. Comparable to other successful social media companies, we believe the key strategy to our future success is to grow the size of our database. Although the revenue from Grom Social is now nominal, the database continues to grow due to our production of original content and through synergies from our subsidiary companies. For example, at GES our MamaBear application has in excess of 800,000 downloads since inception; and our web filtering products are being used by over 2.0 million K-12 students each year. We are in the process of making these users aware of the Grom social website. There can be no assurance that we can continue to grow the Grom website and that if we are successful in doing so, we will be able to generate significant revenues from the site. 
·        Expand Core Products. We manage our existing and new brands through strategic product development initiatives, including introducing new products and by modifying existing intellectual property. Our marketing teams and development team strive to develop enhanced products to offer added technological, aesthetic and functional improvements to our portfolio of products.
·        Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We supplement our internal growth with selected strategic and synergistic acquisitions.
 
·        Capitalize on Our Operating Efficiencies. We believe that our current infrastructure and operating model can accommodate growth without a proportionate increase in our operating and administrative expenses, thereby increasing our operating margins.
 
The execution of our growth strategy, however, is subject to several risks and uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience growth or maintain our present level of net sales. For example, our growth strategy will place additional demands upon our management, operational capacity and financial resources and systems. The increased demand upon management may necessitate our recruitment and retention of additional qualified management personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel or expand and manage our operations effectively and profitably. To effectively manage future growth, we must continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to train, motivate and manage our work force. While we believe that our operational, financial and management information systems will be adequate to support our future growth, no assurance can be given they will be adequate without significant investment in our infrastructure. Failure to expand our operational, financial and management information systems or to train, motivate or manage employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Risk Factors on page 14 of this Annual Report.
 
Seasonality
 
We believe that seasonality does not have any impact on our operations. 
 
Competition
 
Grom Social
 
We believe that the markets in which we compete are characterized by innovation and new and rapidly evolving technologies. We believe we will face significant and intense competition in every aspect of our intended business, including from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Google, which offer a variety of Internet products, services, and content, that will compete for our users Internet time and spending dollars. In addition to facing general competition from these large, well-funded companies, we also face completion from smaller Internet companies that offer products and services that may compete directly with Grom Social for users, such as Yoursphere, Fanlala, Franktown Rocks, Facebook and Sweety High and others. Additionally, as we introduce new services and products, as our existing services and products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition from:

· | Companies that offer products that replicate either partial or the full range of capabilities we intend to provide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9
-


· | Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social or other communications functionality, such as messaging, photo-and video-sharing, and micro-blogging.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies that provide web-and mobile-based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage our target audience and capture time spent on mobile devices and online.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of these companies have substantially greater resources than us.
 
We believe that the following features differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a possible competitive advantage with respect to our target market:
 

· | We provide children with a social media experience in a safe and controlled environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that Grom Social is one of the only, if not the only, Internet platform that offers games, chatrooms, educational services, social interaction, exclusive content, global connectivity and group collaboration to develop new content and activities based on user behavior in one platform.
 
TD Holdings
 
We have extensive competition in our animation business coming from Korea, Canada, India, Ireland and to a lesser degree, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. A number of these territories are government subsidized which sometimes makes it difficult to compete due to artificially low pricing levels. Also, the U.S. market has traditionally had a love affair with Korea and continues to for its branded properties.
 
We expect that TDA’s digitally animated features will compete with family-oriented, animated and live action feature films and other family-oriented entertainment products produced by major movie studios, including Disney, DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc., Warner Bros. Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox Entertainment Group Inc., Paramount Pictures, Lucasfilm Ltd., Universal Studios, Inc., MGM/UA, and Studio Ghibli as well as numerous other independent motion picture production companies.
 
The primary competitors of TD Holdings within the Philippines are Toon City, Animation, Snipple Animation Studio and Synergy 88 Digital. Another significant competitor is Mercury Filmworks in Canada.
 
The competitive environment in the television industry has changed significantly over the past few years following the deployment of digital set-top boxes, the launch of numerous new television networks and the resulting fragmentation of the market. Competition is based primarily on consumer preferences and extends to the Company’s ability to generate and otherwise acquire popular entertainment and trademark properties and secure licenses to exploit, and effectively distribute and market, such properties.

Grom Educational Services
 
iBoss, Lightspeed and Securly are the main webfiltering competitors. There are other larger companies that have web filtering as a part of the larger product offering: Forcepoint (Websense), Bluecoat, Palo Alto Networks, Barracuda, Cisco, etc. All of the larger companies are enterprise focused where they sell numerous products, and filtering is a minimal part of their portfolio.
Grom Nutritional Services
 
Consumer awareness regarding the benefits of dietary supplements and new product availability are the major drivers for the market world-wide. The nutritional supplements markets is an extremely competitive market estimated to be a $175 billion global market by 2020 according to the FN Media Group LLC. The largest companies in this space are Axxess Pharma Inc., Celsius Holdings, Inc., GNC Holdings Inc. and Pfizer Inc. 
Illumination America Lighting 
 
Since we are only a distributor of lighting products and do not do any manufacturing, we currently face very intense competition from both traditional lighting companies that provide general lighting products, including incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), metal halide (MH) and neon lighting. We also have competitors from specialized lighting companies that are engaged in providing LED products. In general, we compete with both groups on the basis of our design, quality of light provided, maintenance costs, safety issues, energy consumption, price, product quality and brightness. Additionally, there are thousands of electrical contractors and lighting distributors of varying scales that install and distribute LED lighting products 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to several U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy and data protection, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the European legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that will include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
 
Our website follows the guidelines of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501–6505. COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
 
Additionally, we are subject to CIPA, which was enacted by Congress in 2000 to address concerns about children's access to obscene or harmful content over the Internet. CIPA imposes certain requirements on schools or libraries that receive discounts for Internet access or internal connections through the E-rate program – a program that makes certain communications services and products more affordable for eligible schools and libraries. In early 2001, the FCC issued rules implementing CIPA and provided updates to those rules in 2011.
