ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview 
A-Mark, also referred to (together with its subsidiaries) as "we", "us" and the "Company", is a full-service precious metals trading company. It is a wholesaler of gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion and related products, including bars, wafers, grain and coins. A-Mark also: 

• | distributes gold and silver coins and bars from sovereign and private mints; 
• | provides financing and other services relating to the purchase and sale of bullion and numismatics; 
• | offers secure storage for precious metal products; 
• | provides our customers a platform of turn-key logistics services; 
• | provides a variety of custom fabricated gold and silver bullion and other specialty products through Sovereign Mint partnerships and its mint operations; and
• | sells directly to the retail community through its Goldline subsidiary. 

A-Mark believes it has one of the largest customer bases in each of its markets and provides one of the most comprehensive offerings of products and services in the precious metals trading industry. Our customers include mints, manufacturers and fabricators, refiners, coin and bullion dealers, e-commerce retailers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, industrial users of precious metals, investors, collectors and retail customers. We serve customers on six continents, with over 10% of our customers located outside the United States. 
A-Mark believes its businesses largely function independently of the price movement of the underlying commodities. However, factors such as global economic activity or uncertainty and inflationary trends, which affect market volatility, have the potential to impact demand, volumes and margins.
History
A-Mark was founded in 1965 as a numismatics firm, which subsequently grew to include wholesale bullion trading and precious metals financing. A-Mark became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spectrum Group International, Inc. ("SGI") in 2005. In March 2014, SGI distributed all of the shares of common stock of A-Mark to its stockholders, effecting a spinoff of A-Mark from SGI. As a result of this distribution, which we refer to as the spinoff, the Company became a publicly traded company independent from SGI. 
Over the years, A-Mark has been steadily expanding its products and services. In 1986, A-Mark became an authorized purchaser of gold and silver bullion coins struck by the United States Mint. Similar arrangements with other sovereign mints followed, so that by the early 1990s, A-Mark had (and continues to have) relationships with all major sovereign mints offering bullion coins and bars internationally. 
In 2005, A-Mark launched its Collateral Finance Corporation ("CFC") subsidiary for the purpose of making secured loans collateralized by bullion and numismatic material. CFC has been steadily expanding the value of its aggregate loan portfolio and number of its customers. CFC has achieved its growth through both origination and loan portfolio acquisitions that it has purchased from wholesale customers of A-Mark, which market to retail customers.
A-Mark opened an overseas office in Vienna, Austria in 2009, for the purpose of marketing its goods and services in the European markets, and the office commenced full trading activity in 2012. This resulted in the expansion of A-Mark's trading hours. Also in 2012, A-Mark formed Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC ("TDS"), a subsidiary that provides customers with turn-key global storage solutions for their precious metals and precious metal products. 
In July 2015, we launched our Las Vegas-based logistics fulfillment center, A-M Global Logistics, LLC, which provides our customers a platform of complementary services, including packaging, shipping, handling, receiving, processing and inventorying of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis.
Our minting operations commenced in August 2016, when we formed a joint venture, AM&ST Associates, LLC ("AMST"), with SilverTowne, L.P., an Indiana-based fabricator of silver bullion products, to acquire its minting business. We own a majority interest in AMST. Since the formation of AMST, the Company has invested in minting equipment and fabrication tools to expand output capabilities, increase production efficiencies and improve product quality, and has leveraged SilverTowne Mint’s fabrication capabilities and coin die portfolio to expand our custom coin programs, as well as to introduce new custom products for individual customers.

In August, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Goldline, LLC, a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community, and now conducts those operations through its subsidiary Goldline, Inc. ("Goldline"). Goldline LLC was formed in 1960 and became well-known to collectors and investors for its world-wide distribution of gold, silver and platinum bullion coins and bars, in part, due to its radio, internet and television marketing and customer service outreach programs which have historically led to a significant base of repeat customers. Since our acquisition, Goldline has expanded its product offerings, improved its delivery times, and provided additional financing options to its customers Also, Goldline has initiated a customer service program to re-engage with Goldline LLC's inactive customers and has invested in technological solutions to reduce the cost of its customer service outreach programs. Furthermore, Goldline has implemented a scaled marketing approach to better align with varying levels of market demands, and has consolidated the predecessor-company's trading, hedging, distribution and customer service functions within A-Mark.

Business Segments
The Company conducts its operations through three reportable segments: (1) Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services, (2) Secured Lending and (3) Direct Sales. Each of these reportable segments represents an aggregation of operating segments that meets the aggregation criteria set forth in the Segment Reporting Topic 280 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) (See Note 18). 
Prior to the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018, the operations of CFC, which now comprise our Secured Lending segment, had been considered part of the Wholesale Trading and & Ancillary Services segment. 
Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services
A-Mark operates through several business units that comprise the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment, including Industrial, Coin and Bar, Trading and Finance, TDS, Logistics and Mint. 
Industrial. Our Industrial unit sells gold, silver, platinum and palladium to industrial and commercial users. Customers include coin fabricators such as mints, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, including electronics, component parts companies, and refiners. Depending on the intended usage, the metals are either investment or industrial grade and are generally in the form of bars, or grains. 
Coin and Bar. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 200 different products, including gold and silver coins from around the world and gold, silver, platinum and palladium bars and ingots in a variety of weights, shapes and sizes. Our customers include 
 4


coin and bullion dealers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, manufacturers, investors, investment advisors, and collectors who qualify as “eligible commercial entities” and “eligible contract participants,” as those terms are defined in the Commodity Exchange Act. 
We are an authorized distributor (and, in the case of the United States Mint, an authorized purchaser) of gold and silver coins for all of the major sovereign mints and various private mints. The sovereign mints include the United States Mint, the Australian (Perth) Mint, the Austrian Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the China Mint, Banco de Mexico, the South African Mint (Rand Refinery) and the Royal Mint (United Kingdom). We purchase and take delivery of coins from the mints for resale to coin dealers, financial institutions and other qualified purchasers. 
Our distribution and purchase agreements with the mints are non-exclusive, and may be terminated by the mints at any time, although in practice our relationship with the mints are long-standing, in some cases, as with the U.S. Mint, extending back for over 20 years. In some cases, we have developed exclusive products with sovereign and private mints for distribution through our dealer network. 
In our Industrial and Coin and Bar units, orders are taken telephonically and also on an electronic trading platform. Pricing is generally based on screen quotes for bullion transactions in the spot market, with two-day settlement, although special pricing and extended settlement terms are also available. For example, a customer can leave an order with A-Mark to purchase at a specified price below the current market price or an order to sell at a specified price above the current market price. Almost all customers in these units take physical delivery of the precious metal. Product is shipped upon receipt of payment, except where the purchase is financed under credit arrangements between A-Mark and the customer. We have relationships with precious metal depositories around the world to facilitate shipment of product from our inventory to these customers, in many cases for next day delivery. Product may either be shipped to the customer's location or delivered to a depository or other storage facility designated by the customer. The Company also periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis, and may charge interest fees based on the value of the metals loaned. Such metal inventories are removed at the time the customers elect to price and purchase the metals, and the Company records a corresponding sale and receivable.
Trading and Finance. Our Trading and Finance units engage in commodity hedging as well as borrowing and lending transactions in support of our Industrial and Coin and Bar units. 
The Trading unit hedges the commodity risk on A-Mark's inventory in order to protect A-Mark from market price fluctuations. A-Mark maintains relationships with major market-makers and multiple futures brokers in order to provide a variety of alternatives for its hedging needs. Our traders employ a combination of future and forward contracts to hedge our market exposure. Because it seeks to substantially hedge its market exposure, A-Mark believes that its business largely functions independently of the price movements of the underlying commodities. Through its hedging activities, A-Mark may also earn contango yields, in which futures price are higher than the spot prices, or backwardation yields, in which futures prices are lower than the spot prices. A-Mark also offers precious metals price quotes in a number of foreign currencies. 
Our Finance unit engages in precious metals borrowing and lending transactions and other customized financial transactions with or on behalf of our customers and other counterparties. These arrangements range from simple hedging structures to complex inventory finance arrangements and forward purchase and sale structures, tailored to the needs of our customers.
TDS. Our Transcontinental Depository Services LLC. ("TDS") subsidiary provides storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors worldwide. TDS contracts on behalf of our clients with independent secure storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe, Singapore and Hong Kong, for either fully segregated or allocated storage. We assist our clients in developing appropriate storage options for their particular requirements, and we manage the operational aspects of the storage with the third party facilities on our clients' behalf. 
Logistics. Our A-M Global Logistics LLC. ("Logistics") subsidiary, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, supports our wholesale trading business by providing a significant amount of the secured storage, shipping and delivery services that had historically been outsourced to third-party depositories in their various locations. By consolidating those operations into one central location under our control, we have reduced our dependence on third-party service providers while enhancing quality control and reducing operating costs.
Logistics also provides turn-key logistics services to our customers engaged in the retail business. We provide these customers with one-stop financing (through our secured lending segment), hedging (through our trading and finance business units), inventory handling, packaging, storage and drop-shipping services.
Mint. In August 2016, the Company formed AM&ST ("Mint"), a joint venture with SilverTowne, L.P., an Indiana-based producer of minted silver. AMST acquired the entire minting operations (referred to as SilverTowne Mint or our "Mint" business unit) of SilverTowne, L.P., with the goal of providing greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as to gain increased access to fabricated silver products during volatile market environments. Since the acquisition, A-Mark has leveraged SilverTowne Mint’s fabrication capabilities and coin die portfolio to expand its custom coin 
 5


programs, as well as to introduce new custom products for individual customers.  As of June 30, 2018, the Company and SilverTowne, L.P. owned 55% and 45%, respectively, of AMST (see Note 19). 
Secured Lending
The Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC. CFC has been in operation since 2005.
CFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors and collectors. As of June 30, 2018, CFC had approximately $110.4 million in secured loans outstanding, of which approximately 67.6% was originated by third parties and acquired by CFC and approximately 32.4% was originated by CFC.
General. CFC’s loans consist of on-demand loans and loans with a term of three months to 364 days, with a typical term of approximately six months. Repayment of the loans can be made at any time without penalty. Because the loans are of relatively short duration, CFC does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations, even in a rising interest rate environment. Loans carried by CFC range in size from $15,000 to $10.0 million. 
All loans are fully secured by bullion or numismatics coins (or in rare cases, by other acceptable collateral.) TDS, on behalf of CFC, takes physical custody of the coins or bullion collateralizing the loans. CFC requires loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios of between 50% and 85%. LTV ratio refers to the principal amount of the loan divided by the liquidation value of the collateral, as conservatively estimated by CFC for numismatic loans and based on daily spot market prices for bullion loans. The LTV ratio varies with the nature of the collateral, with CFC requiring, for example, a higher LTV ratio for bullion than for rare coins. If, because of fluctuations in the market price of the pledged collateral, the LTV ratio on a loan drops below a prescribed minimum ratio, typically 85%, CFC can make a margin call on the loan. If the borrower does not meet the margin call, either by wiring payment or supplying additional collateral, CFC is authorized to sell the collateral, which it does through its A-Mark affiliates. Because of its conservative lending practices, CFC has never experienced losses of principal on its loans. 
CFC has historically financed its loan origination and acquisition activity through a demand line of credit with several financial institutions. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, CFC announced its intention to engage in securitization financing, whereby it would issue privately placed notes secured by the loans that it owns and the bullion and numismatics collateralizing the loans. 
Origination Activity. CFC's origination activities are complementary to the Company’s coin and bullion businesses, and afford our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections. CFC also attempts to leverage the worldwide storage capabilities of its TDS affiliate by offering clients TDS’s asset protection services in connection with the loans. CFC’s marketing efforts for its origination activity are conducted both in partnership with A-Mark, particularly with respect to dealers, and independently, including though its dedicated website cfccoinloans.com. Interest rates on loans originated by CFC are determined based on current market conditions, borrower profile and type or mix of collateral. CFC also offers a variety of custom loan services to its origination clients, including renewal options, options to increase loan size, financing arrangements tailored to facilitate participation in numismatic auctions, and revolving loan arrangements. CFC services the loans that it originates. 
Acquisition Activity. CFC also acquires portfolios of loans secured by bullion and numismatics coins from third party originators. The originators may be customers of A-Mark, who finance the purchases by their borrowers of precious metals and coins sourced by the originator, in whole or in part, from A-Mark. The loans acquired by CFC are sold subject to customary representations and warranties for loan portfolios of this type, and must comply with CFC’s criteria for quality of collateral, LTV ratio, term and interest rate. Upon acquisition of a loan portfolio, CFC takes physical possession of the collateral securing the loans. In the event that a loan is non-performing, the collateral will typically be liquidated by A-Mark on behalf of the originator in order to retire the loan. Typically, loan portfolios acquired by CFC are serviced by the originator for a fee.
Direct Sales
The Company operates its Direct Sales segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goldline Inc. (“Goldline”). The Company acquired the business in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline LLC. Goldline LLC had been in operation since 1960. 
Direct-to-Client Sales. Goldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline markets its precious metal products primarily on radio, the internet and television, as well as through telephonic sales efforts, particularly to Goldline’s repeat customers. The Company acquired the Goldline business with the objective of enhancing the Company’s distribution capabilities by adding a direct-to-client distribution channel. The Company also anticipated that the acquisition would diversify the product and services offering to Goldline customers, through access to the Company’s wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, CFC's secured lending services and TDS’s storage and asset protection services. Since the acquisition, the Company has been focused on rationalizing the cost structure of the Goldline business to promote profitability.

Goldline customers are required to open an account with Goldline and enter into an account agreement. The agreement specifies the terms and conditions of purchase and explains the availability of certain programs and services offered by Goldline to its customers. 
Liquidity
               Our business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. The Company’s line of credit provides it with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually.  Additional sources of funds are generated through product financing arrangements with customers, whereby the Company sells its inventory with an option to repurchase, and through borrowing arrangements with its suppliers. In addition, the Company generates cash from earning interest income on secured loans and secured financing structures, and from other finance products.
Market Making Activity
We act as a principal market maker, maintaining a two-way market for buying and selling precious metals. This means we both sell product to and purchase product from our customers. 
Inventory 
We maintain a substantial inventory of bullion and coins in order to provide our customers with selection and prompt delivery. We acquire product for our inventory in the course of our trading activities with our customers, directly from mints, mines and refiners and from commodities brokers and dealers, privately and in transactions on established commodity exchanges. Except for certain lower of cost or market products, our inventory is “marked to market” daily for accounting and financial reporting purposes. 
Sales and Marketing
We market our products and services primarily through our offices in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria, our website and our dealer network, which we believe is the largest of its kind in North America. The dealer network consists of over 700 independent precious metal and coin companies, with whom we transact on a non-exclusive basis. The arrangements with the dealers vary, but generally the dealers acquire product from us for resale to their customers. In some instances, we deliver bullion to the dealers on a consignment basis. We also participate from time to time in trade shows and conventions, at which we promote our products and services. As a vertically integrated precious metals concern, a key element of our marketing strategy is being able to cross-sell our products and services to customers within our various business units. 
Operational Support 
The Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment maintains administrative and operational support at its headquarters in El Segundo, California. We believe that our existing administrative and operational support infrastructure has the capacity to scale up with our business activities. We store our inventories of bullion and numismatics at third party depositories in major financial centers around the world and at our facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. As of June 30, 2018, A-Mark has an uncommitted line of credit that provided us with access up to $260.0 million, featuring a $210.0 million base with a $50.0 million accordion option, which it has used to fund substantially all of the operations of the Company.
The Secured Lending segment maintains administrative support at its headquarters in El Segundo, California for the processing of its originated loans, including billing of interest, managing margin calls and tracking of precious metal collateral. However, for the processing administration of loans that are acquired from a third-party (usually a customer of A-Mark), customer invoices are typically processed by the originating dealer of the loan portfolio, through a servicing arrangement, for a fee based on the interest rate charged to the end-consumer. The operational support (specifically, the collateral custody and security) is managed by our logistics business unit. Additionally, A-Mark provides funds to CFC to purchase additional bullion and numismatic secured loans. 
The Direct Sales segment maintains administrative and operational support at its office in Los Angeles, California for soliciting and processing it retail orders. The Company's Trading, Finance and Logistics business units and secured lending segment provide supporting services such as hedging, order fulfillment and lending services.
With a third party software developer, we have created a proprietary trading program, referred to as the Metals Trading System ("MTS"). Through MTS we are able to input, process, track and document our trading activity, including complex hedging and similar transactions. Additionally, we have developed and implemented an electronic trading platform for receiving and processing customer orders, with the objective of improving transactional ease and efficiency, and also extended trading hours. 
Supplier and Customer Concentrations 
A-Mark buys a majority of its precious metals from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes that numerous other suppliers are available and would provide similar products on comparable terms. In addition, through the Company's Mint business operation, it has the capabilities to design and mint silver custom bullion-coins to respond to changing market demands.

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had two customers, HSBC Bank USA and Mitsubishi Intl. Corporation, each comprising more than 10% of our revenues (see Note 17.) The Company's largest customers characteristically have significant forward contract sales activity (as opposed to those customers with whom we principally have physical trading activity), which are entered to hedge the Company's commodity holding risks, and not for speculative purposes.
Competition
A-Mark's activities cover a broad spectrum of the precious metals industry, with a concentration on the physical market. We service public, industrial and private sector consumers of precious metals which include industrial manufactures, refiners, minting facilities, banks, brokerage houses and private investors. We frequently face different competitors in each area and it is not uncommon for a customer and/or a supplier in one market segment to be a competitor in another. Our competitors may offer more favorable pricing or services considered to be superior to ours.
Our Secured Lending segment's market is believed to have limited direct competition. We believe factors, including access to capital, secure storage facilities, bullion and numismatic expertise and other related services and offerings, provide us a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Our Direct Sales' market environment is highly-competitive and highly-concentrated with a significant number of active loyal customers, from which we can expand product and service offerings and generate new customers from our sponsorship of syndicated radio and from acquired lists of marketing information.
Our competitors may offer more favorable pricing or services considered to be superior to ours. 
Trading Seasonality
While our precious metals trading business is not seasonal, we believe it is directly impacted by the perception of market trends and global economic activity. Historically, anticipation of increases in the rate of inflation, interest rates as well as anticipated devaluation of the U.S. dollar, have resulted in higher levels of interest in precious metals as well as higher prices for such metals. 
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we had 188 employees, with 186 located in North America, and two located in Europe; all except eight of these employees were considered full-time employees. We regard our relations with our employees as good. 
Corporate Information 
A-Mark was founded in 1965 as a New York corporation. In January 2014, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware.
