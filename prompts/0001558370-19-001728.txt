 Item 1. Business
     Overview
     Daseke, Inc. is a leading provider of transportation and logistics solutions focused exclusively on flatbed and specialized freight. The Company is the largest flatbed and specialized logistics carrier,1 and is among the top 10 truckload carriers,2 in North America. From 2009 to 2018, the Company has grown revenue from $30 million to $1,613 million at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56%. The Company’s predecessor was incorporated in Delaware in 2008.
     Daseke believes that it provides one of the most comprehensive transportation and logistics solutions offerings in the open-deck industry. The Company delivers a diverse offering of transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 5,900 customers across the continental United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2018, Daseke’s company and owner-operator drivers drove approximately 463 million miles.
     The Company has two reportable segments: Flatbed Solutions and Specialized Solutions. The Flatbed Solutions segment focuses on delivering transportation and logistics solutions that principally require the use of flatbed and retractable-sided transportation equipment, and the Specialized Solutions segment focuses on delivering transportation and logistics solutions that principally include super heavy haul, high-value customized, over-dimensional, commercial glass and high-security cargo solutions. The Flatbed Solutions segment generated approximately 41% of total revenue in 2018, and the Specialized Solutions segment generated approximately 59% of total revenue in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Flatbed Solutions segment operated 2,963 tractors and 5,141 trailers, and the Specialized Solutions segment operated 3,181 tractors and 8,683 trailers.
     Both of the Company’s reportable segments operate highly flexible business models comprised of company-owned tractors and asset-light operations (which consist of owner-operator transportation, freight brokerage and logistics). The Company’s asset-based operations have the benefit of providing shippers with certainty of delivery and continuity of operations. Alternatively, the Company’s asset-light operations offer flexibility and scalability to meet customers’ dynamic needs and have lower capital expenditure requirements and fixed costs. In 2018, approximately 49% of the Company’s freight, logistics and brokerage revenue was derived from company-owned equipment and approximately 51% was derived from asset-light services.
     Business Combination 
     On February 27, 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II, a special purpose acquisition company with no operations (Hennessy), merged with and into Daseke, Inc., with Daseke, Inc. surviving as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Hennessy (the Business Combination), in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 22, 2016 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Hennessy, HCAC Merger Sub, Inc., Daseke, Inc. and Don R. Daseke, solely in his capacity as the Stockholder Representative (as defined therein). Subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, Daseke, Inc. changed its name to “Daseke Companies, Inc.” and Hennessy Capital changed its name to “Daseke, Inc.” Unless expressly stated otherwise, references to the Company or Daseke refers to Daseke, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hennessy refers to the registrant prior to the closing of the Business Combination, and Private Daseke refers to Daseke, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Business Combination. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Business Combination.

      Industry and Competition
     The transportation and logistics market is one of the largest industries in the United States.  The flatbed and specialized (open-deck) freight market currently represents approximately 10% of the more than 1.5 million population of trucks used in the broader transportation and logistics market.  Open-deck freight is defined as loads secured atop trailer decks without sides or a roof and is generally both complex and time-sensitive, which separates it from traditional dry-van freight. The open-deck industry is focused on different customers with different freight requirements than traditional dry-van and requires highly trained drivers and specialized equipment with the ability to handle uniquely shaped and overweight cargo. Specialized loads often require specific expertise to address the additional administrative paperwork, proper licenses and hauling permits, extensive coordination with local officials and escort vehicles. 
     Open-deck routes are frequently more irregular than dry-van routes due to the nature of the freight. Open-deck lanes stretch across the country, with particular density around corridors of significant lumber, steel and machinery production, notably in the Southeast, Midwest, Texas and West Coast regions of the United States. 
     The open-deck industry is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company competes primarily with other flatbed carriers and to a lesser extent, logistics companies, as well as railroads. The Company competes with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors and management employees and with logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees. The Company believes that the principal differentiating factors in its business, relative to competition, are scale, North American footprint of operations, service, efficiency, pricing, the availability and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers’ needs, and its ability to provide comprehensive transportation solutions to customers.

 Customers
     The Company’s customers, many of whom are Fortune 500 companies, rely on it to transport mission-critical loads, making it an integral part of their supply chains. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has approximately 5,900 customers. The Company’s ability to dependably transport high-value, complex and time-sensitive loads as well as provide the value-added logistics services required to plan, transport and deliver loads has resulted in longstanding and established customer relationships. In 2018 and 2017 customer relationships with our top ten customers, based on revenue, span more than 20 years on average at the Company’s operating divisions.
     The Company’s customers represent a broad and attractive range of end markets. Examples of the freight the Company regularly transports include aircraft parts, manufacturing equipment, structural steel, pressure vessels, wind turbine blades, heavy machinery (construction, mining and agricultural), commercial glass, high security cargo, arms, ammunition and explosives (AA&E), lumber and building and construction materials. Because the Company’s customers are generally in the industrial and manufacturing sector, as is typical for open-deck services providers, the Company is not subject to the same consumer-driven demand as dry-van trucking companies, whose freight typically includes consumer goods and whose volume can peak during the holiday season. 
     In 2018, the Company’s Flatbed Solutions segment provided transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 3,000 customers, and the Company’s Specialized Solutions segment provided unique, value-added transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 2,900 customers. See Note 17 of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on its two reportable segments.
     A material portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from its major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In 2018 and 2017, the Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 29% and 31%, respectively, of its revenue; however, in 2018 and 2017, no single customer represented more than 5% and 6%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue. In 2018 and 2017, no customer of the Flatbed Solutions segment or the Specialized Solutions segment accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated total revenue.
     Revenue Equipment
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company operated 3,882 company-owned tractors. The Company also had under contract 2,262 tractors owned and operated by independent contractors as of December 31, 2018. The Company also operated 13,824 trailers as of December 31, 2018. Growth of its tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and its experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization and driver recruitment and retention. In acquiring revenue equipment (tractors, trailers and trailer accessories), the Company considers a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driver comfort and resale value. The Company maintains strong relationships with its equipment vendors and the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate. The Company’s acquisitions have provided a significant increase in its tractor and trailer fleets.     Employees and Independent Contractors
     As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 5,829 full-time employees in the Company’s total employee headcount of 5,930, which includes approximately 3,669 drivers. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
     The Company also contracts with owner-operator drivers to provide and operate tractors, which provide additional revenue equipment capacity. Independent contractors own or lease their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance and highway use taxes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 2,262 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 42% of total miles in 2018.
     The Company’s strategy for both company and owner-operator drivers is to (i) use safe and experienced drivers (the majority of driver positions hired require twelve months of over-the-road experience); (ii) promote retention with positive working conditions and a competitive compensation package in the case of company drivers and contracted rates in the 

 
  6


 
case of owner-operator drivers; and (iii) minimize safety problems through careful screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, electronic logging system and rewards for accident-free driving. The Company also seeks to minimize turnover of company drivers by providing highly attractive tractors and focusing on providing upgraded nationwide facilities. As a result, at least one of the Company’s operating companies has been named to the Truckload Carriers Association’s 20 Best Fleets to Drive For® in North America each year since 2010, and the Company has achieved driver retention rates that it believes are superior to the trucking industry average.
     Safety and Risk Management
     The Company takes pride in its safety-focused culture and conducts mandatory intensive orientation for all of its drivers. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that the Company perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations, and its safety program includes pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT. The Company also equips its company tractors with critical-event recorders to help continually train drivers and widely deploys truck-mounted cameras, so that the Company can prevent or reduce the severity of accidents and claims.
     The primary safety-related risks associated with the Company’s business include damage to cargo hauled, physical damage to company equipment, damage to buildings and personal property, third-party personal injury and property damage and workers’ compensation. The Company regularly reviews insurance limits and retentions. The Company’s historic and current retention, in the majority of instances, is $0.5 million. In addition, the Company has secured excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million per occurrence.
     To the extent under dispatch and in furtherance of the Company’s business, its owner-operators are covered by the Company’s liability coverage. However, each such owner-operator is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes, and, in the case of fleet operators, any applicable workers’ compensation requirements for their employees.
     Fuel
     The Company actively manages its fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce its fuel costs. The Company purchases its fuel through a network of retail truck stops with which it has negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The Company seeks to reduce its fuel costs by routing its drivers to truck stops with which the Company has negotiated volume purchase discounts when fuel prices at such stops are lower than the bulk rate paid for fuel at the Company’s terminals. The Company stores fuel in aboveground and underground storage tanks at some of its facilities.
     To help offset increases in fuel prices, the Company utilizes a fuel surcharge program designed to compensate the Company for fuel costs above a certain cost per gallon base. Generally, the Company receives fuel surcharges on the miles for which it is compensated by customers. In addition to its fuel surcharge program, the Company believes the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel-efficient fleet by incorporating fuel efficiency measures. The Company has not used derivatives as a hedge against higher fuel costs in the past but continues to evaluate this possibility.
     Seasonality
     In the transportation industry, results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern. The Company’s productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, end-user activity and some shippers reduce their shipments during winter. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions.

     Regulation
     The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, provincial, state, local and foreign government agencies in the United States and Canada. In the United States, the Company and its drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT and the agencies within the states that regulate transportation, including those regulations relating to drug- and alcohol-testing and hours-of-service. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. The Company also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, environmental protection, drivers’ hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, ergonomics and other matters affecting safety, insurance and operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also regulate the Company’s equipment, operations, drivers and the environment. The Company conducts operations outside of the United States, and is subject to analogous governmental safety, fitness, weight and equipment regulations and environmental protection and operating standards, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment. For example, in Canada, Daseke must conduct its operations in various provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in those provinces.
     The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. In December 2011, the FMCSA published its 2011 Hours-of-Service Final Rule (the 2011 Rule), requiring drivers to take 30-minute breaks after eight hours of consecutive driving and reducing the total number of hours a driver is permitted to work during each week from 82 to 70 hours. The 2011 Rule provided that a driver may restart calculation of the weekly time limits after taking 34 or more consecutive hours off duty, including two rest periods between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.; these restrictions are referred to as the 2011 Restart Restrictions. These 2011 rule changes, including the 2011 Restart Restrictions, became effective on July 1, 2013. However, in December, 2014, Congress passed the 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which was signed into law on December 16, 2014. Among other things, the legislation provided relief from the 2011 Restart Restrictions, reverting requirements back to those in effect before the 2011 Rule became effective, including the more straight forward 34-hour restart period, without need for two rest periods between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.. In December, 2014, the FMCSA published a Notice of Suspension summarizing this suspension of enforcement of the 2011 Restart Restrictions.
     The FMCSA has adopted a data-driven Compliance, Safety and Accountability (the CSA) program as its safety enforcement and compliance model. The CSA program holds motor carries and drivers accountable for their role in safety by evaluating and ranking fleets and individual drivers on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program affects drivers because their safety performance and compliance impact their safety records and, while working for a carrier, will impact their carrier’s safety record. The methodology for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating relies upon implementation of Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASIC) applicable to the on-road safety performance of the carrier’s drivers and certain of those rating results are provided on the FMCSA’s Carrier Safety Measurement System website. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for the Company, the Company’s fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to its peer firms, and the Company’s safety rating could be adversely impacted. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment (in the case of company drivers) or contracts (in the case of owner-operator drivers) with other carriers, or could cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with better fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and productivity. Additionally, the Company may incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve its scores as a result of such poor rankings. Those carriers and drivers identified under the CSA program as exhibiting poor BASIC scores are prioritized for interventions, such as warning letters and roadside investigations, either of which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. To promote improvement in all CSA categories, including those both over and under the established scoring threshold, the Company has procedures in place to address areas where it has exceeded the thresholds and the Company continually reviews all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness and revises them, as necessary, to establish positive improvement. However, the Company cannot assure you these measures will be effective.

     The methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating could be changed by the FMCSA and, as a result, the Company’s acceptable safety rating could be impaired. In particular, the FMCSA continues to utilize the three safety fitness rating scale—“satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory”—to assess the safety fitness of motor carriers and the Company currently has a “satisfactory” FMCSA rating on 100% of its fleet. However, pursuant to a 2015 federal statutory mandate, the FMCSA commissioned the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study and report upon the CSA program and its underlying Safety Measurement System (SMS), which is the FMCSA’s process for identifying patterns of non-compliance and issuing safety-fitness determinations for motor carriers. In June 2017, the NAS published a report on the subject providing specific recommendations and concluding, among other things, that the FMCSA should explore a more formal statistical model to replace the current SMS process. In June 2018, the FMCSA posted its response to the NAS study in a report to Congress, concluding, among other things, that it would develop and test a new model, the Item Response Theory (IRT), which would replace the SMS process currently used. The FMCSA was expected to commence small scale testing of the IRT model as early as September 2018, with full scale testing expected to occur in April 2019 and possible program roll-out expected to occur in late 2019 but the testing schedule has been delayed. The FMCSA’s June 2018 response is under audit by the DOT Inspector General to assess consistency with the NAS recommendations, and the audit findings will guide the agency’s actions and timing with respect to testing of the IRT model as a potential replacement for the SMS, in the event and to the extent that the FMCSA adopts the IRT model in replacement of the SMS or otherwise pursues rulemakings in the future that revise the methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating in a manner that incorporates more stringent standards, then it is possible that the Company and other motor carriers could be adversely affected, as compared to consideration of the current standards. If the Company were to receive an unsatisfactory CSA score, whether under the current SMS process, the IRT model, should it be finalized, and adopted, or as a result of some other safety-fitness determination, it could adversely affect the Company’s business as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and an unsatisfactory rating could negatively impact or restrict the Company’s operations.
     In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. This could reduce the pool of qualified drivers, which could require the Company to increase driver compensation or owner-operator contracted rates, limit fleet growth or allow trucks to be non-productive. Consequently, it is possible that the Company may fail to meet the needs of customers or may incur increased expenses.
     The FMCSA published a final rule in December 2015 mandating the use of Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) for commercial motor vehicle drivers to measure their compliance with hours-of-service requirements by December 18, 2017. The 2015 ELD final rule generally applies to most motor carriers and drivers who are required to keep records of duty status, unless they qualify for an exception to the rule, and the rule also applies to drivers domiciled in Canada and Mexico. Under the 2015 final rule, motor carriers and drivers subject to the rule were required to use either an ELD or an automatic onboard recording device (AOBRD) compliant with existing regulations by December 18, 2017. However, the AOBRDs may only be used until December 16, 2019, provided those devices were put into use before December 18, 2017. Starting December 16, 2019, all carriers and drivers subject to the 2015 final rule must use ELDs. Commencing with the December 18, 2017 effective date, the Company and other motor carriers subject to the 2015 rule are required to use ELDs or AOBRDs in their operations.
     The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from its vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, and adverse impacts to the environment, including to the soil, groundwater and surface water. The Company has implemented programs designed to monitor and address identified environmental risks. Historically, the Company’s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results. Additionally, certain of the Company’s operating companies are Charter Partners in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. If the Company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities. Those costs and liabilities may include the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or 

 
  9


 
performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of its operations in a particular area. The occurrence of any one or more of such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results.
     The Company maintains bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at some of its terminals. The Company also has vehicle maintenance operations at certain of its facilities. The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, discharge of contaminants, environmental and natural resource damage, and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others. Some of the Company’s operations are at facilities where soil and groundwater contamination have occurred, and the Company or its predecessors have been responsible for remediating environmental contamination at some locations. In the past, the Company has also been responsible for the costs of cleanup of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused during its transportation operations, including as a result of traffic accidents or other events. If the Company is found to be responsible for such contamination or spills, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities, including costs for remediation, environmental natural resource damages and penalties.
     The EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions became more restrictive in 2010. In 2010, a presidential executive memorandum was signed directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for, among other vehicles, heavy-duty trucks. In 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final Phase 1 rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty vehicles. These standards apply to certain combination tractors’ model years 2014 to 2018 and require them to achieve an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by model year 2018, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. Additionally, in October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA jointly published final Phase 2 standards for improving fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from new on-road medium- and heavy-duty vehicles beginning for model year 2019 and extending through model year 2027. The Phase 2 standards build upon the Phase 1 standards, encouraging wider application of currently available technologies and the development of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through model year 2027. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions limits and fuel efficiency standards will be imposed on new trailers. The Company expects that these Phase 2 standards, if unchanged to make less stringent, will result in its incurrence of increased costs for acquiring new tractors and for additional parts and maintenance activities to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards. Such increased costs could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA announced the CTI, pursuant to which it plans to propose and finalize a rulemaking updating standards for nitrogen oxide emissions from highway heavy-duty trucks and engines. The EPA is expected to issue a proposed rulemaking to implement the CTI program in early 2020.  The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be adversely impacted, by these or any other new fuel or emission restrictions.
     Notwithstanding the federal standards, a number of states have mandated, and states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment that could increase equipment or other costs for entire fleets. For instance, the California Air Resource Board also has adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the state of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these regulations must be either EPA Smart Way certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with Smart Way-approved aerodynamic technologies. The Company currently purchases Smart Way certified equipment in its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have also begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force the Company to alter its drivers’ behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or face a decrease in productivity.
     Federal and state lawmakers also have implemented or proposed potential limits on greenhouse gas emissions under a variety of other climate-change initiatives. Compliance with such regulations may increase the cost of new tractors and trailers or require the Company to retrofit its equipment, and could impair equipment productivity and increase its operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual value of these vehicles, could materially increase the Company’s operating expenses or otherwise adversely affect its operations.

     Since 2013, any entity acting as a broker or a freight forwarder is required to obtain authority from the FMCSA, and is subject to a minimum $75,000 financial security requirement. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries are licensed by the FMCSA as a property broker and, therefore, they are obligated to satisfy this financial security requirement. This new requirement may limit entry of new brokers into the market or cause current brokers to exit the market. Such persons may seek agent relationships with companies such as the Company to avoid this increased cost. If they do not seek out agent relationships, the number of brokers in the industry could decrease.
