ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. is a technology-driven independent oilfield services company that has historically offered well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Our service offerings extended to exploration and production (“E&P) companies in the United States and Argentina.
 
In September 2018, we completed work under our pressure pumping contract with our primary U.S. customer. Based on the weakness of the U.S. well stimulation market, in September 2018 we elected to suspend our U.S. well stimulation operations and significantly reduce our U.S. workforce in alignment with potential near-term opportunities, including pump down and miscellaneous pumping services. As previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2018 filed on November 14, 2018, we have been actively pursuing the sale of all material equipment, inventory and other operating assets relating to our U.S. operations.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its U.S. equipment and other operating assets to unrelated third parties in several separate transactions in exchange for aggregate cash proceeds, before commissions and selling expenses, of approximately $5.7 million. On January 24, 2019, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its U.S. equipment to an unrelated party in exchange for approximately $2.8 million of aggregate cash proceeds, before commissions and selling expenses. On February 21, 2019, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its U.S. equipment to an unrelated party in exchange for approximately $6.2 million of aggregate cash proceeds, before commissions and selling expenses. On March 14, 2019, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its U.S. equipment to an unrelated party in exchange for approximately $2.1 million of aggregate cash proceeds, before commissions and selling expenses. Net of commissions, the Company received approximately $16.8 million. In the U.S., we have sold all the material equipment, inventory and other operating assets relating to our U.S. operations and terminated all field level employees.
 
In Argentina, we operated under a transition agreement with our primary customer beginning May 2018 and continued to provide services under that agreement during the third quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2018, we have not provided any services to our primary customer in Argentina under the transition agreement or otherwise, and have not generated any material revenue from our Argentina operations since the third quarter of 2018. As previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2018 filed on November 14, 2018, we have been pursuing strategic alternatives, including alternatives for the Company’s operations in Argentina that could include selling, reducing the scale of, or shutting down the Company’s operations in Argentina.
 
In line with the Company’s decision to either sell the Argentine company or sell the assets of the Argentine company, on March 18, 2019, the Company signed an agreement with an unrelated third party to purchase significantly all of our equipment and machinery assets in Argentina. The transactions contemplated by this agreement are expected to close in phases during the second quarter of 2019, with no continuing obligation or involvement by the Company in the operation of these assets. Following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, the Company expects to shut down its operations in Argentina.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has classified our Argentina subsidiary as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this filing. The Company made the decision, having received a letter of intent during the fourth quarter of 2018 from a third party, to sell the subsidiary. Refer to Note 17 – Assets Held for Sale-Discontinued Operations of our consolidated financial statements for additional details. As of December 31, 2018, the Company classified certain U.S. spare parts, equipment and machinery as held for sale based on the decision by the Company to seek buyers for and sell these assets. Refer to Note 17 – Assets Held for Sale-Discontinued Operations of our consolidated financial statements for additional details on the impact of this classification.

On December 28, 2018, the Company received a determination letter from Nasdaq that the Company would be delisted pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Company determined not to appeal the determination and the quotation of the Company’s common stock moved to the “Pink Open Market” operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. The common stock was subsequently delisted from Nasdaq due to the Company’s non-compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirements. Specifically, the Nasdaq suspended trading in the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq, effective prior to the regular opening of the market on January 2, 2019. The Nasdaq subsequently filed a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration on Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on February 26, 2019 to remove the common stock from listing on Nasdaq and withdraw the common stock from registration under Section 12(b) pursuant to Rule 12d2-2(b) of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to Rule 12d2-2(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, the application on Form 25 became effective with respect to the delisting of the common stock ten (10) days after the Form 25 was filed with the SEC.
 
As disclosed previously in Form 8-K filed February 14, 2019, the Company has implemented a reverse stock split. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shareholders of record and allows the Company to deregister the common stock and reduce ongoing expenses with respect to filings under the Exchange Act. Those shareholders who, immediately following the reverse stock split, held only a fraction of a share of the Company’s common stock were paid, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash equal to $0.08 (on a post-split basis) times such fraction of a share and are no longer shareholders of the Company. After the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the filing of a Form 15 to suspend the Company’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will no longer be subject to certain provisions of the Exchange Act. In particular, the Company’s obligations to publicly file periodic and current reports with the SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be suspended.
 
Our Services
 
The Company offered a variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the various services we offered is provided below.
Pressure Pumping
 
Our customers utilized our pressure pumping services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, which restricts the natural flow of hydrocarbons. The technique of well stimulation consists of pumping a fluid into a cased well at sufficient pressure to create new channels in the rock, which can increase the extraction rates and the ultimate recovery of the hydrocarbons. Our equipment that was contracted by E&P companies to provide pressure-pumping services is referred to as a “well stimulation fleet” or “spread.”
 
During a portion of 2018, we operated three well stimulation fleets, two in the United States based out of our operations facility in Fairview, Oklahoma, and one in Argentina based out of our operations facility in Neuquén, Argentina. In the United States, we provided pressure pumping services to customers in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. From our operations base in Fairview, Oklahoma, we provided services to E&P companies in the mid-continent region, including in the Scoop, Stack, Cana-Woodford, Mississippian Lime and Springer plays.
 
During 2018, our well stimulation fleets generally included high pressure well-stimulation pumps and other supporting equipment, in both trailer-mounted and skid-mounted configurations. We had the capability of providing a variety of pressure-pumping services, including work-over pumping and well injection.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 45 high-pressure pumps with an aggregate capacity of approximately 101,250 horsepower (“HHP”) and owned an additional 12 high-pressure pumps with an aggregate capacity of approximately 27,000 HHP that require refurbishment and upgrade prior to activation for service. As of April 1, 2019, significantly all of our material operating machinery and equipment has been sold.

Coiled Tubing
 
During 2018, we offered coiled tubing services to customers in Argentina. Our coiled tubing services were used to perform various functions associated with well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing services involve the insertion of steel tubing into a well to convey materials and/or equipment to perform various applications as part of a new completion or the servicing of existing wells, including wellbore maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. Coiled tubing has become a preferred method of well completion, workover and maintenance projects due to speed, ability to handle heavy-duty jobs across a wide spectrum of pressure environments, safety and ability to perform services without having to shut-in a well. The capabilities of our coiled tubing units in Argentina were their ability to cover a wide range of applications for horizontal completion, work-over and well-maintenance projects.
Customers
 
In May 2017, our first U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma for an independent E&P company. In October 2017, our second U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma for another independent E&P company. In November 2017, we negotiated an early release of our first U.S. spread from our contract with our first U.S. customer. In March 2018, and after securing sand delivery and other needed equipment, we redeployed this fleet to serve an independent E&P company operating in the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties (“STACK”) play. This spread did not provide services to customers in April 2018 but resumed operations with a new independent E&P company customer in early May 2018. We subsequently ceased to provide services to this customer. In late May 2018, we agreed to provide our primary U.S. customer with additional dedicated horsepower and equipment, including certain of our natural gas-powered pumping units, to create what we referred to as a “super fleet” in support of a collaborative plan to improve the efficiency of our U.S. operations.
 
In September 2018, we completed work under our pressure pumping contract with our primary U.S. customer. Given the weakness of the U.S. well stimulation market, in September 2018 we elected to suspend our U.S. well stimulation operations and significantly reduce our U.S. workforce.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company provided pump down services for a major E&P company, but did not provide any other services in the U.S.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, one U.S. customer accounted for 99% of our total U.S. revenue.
 
In Argentina, our customers consisted primarily of international oil and gas E&P companies including national oil companies, local privately-held exploration and production companies and, on occasion, other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide well stimulation and completion services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest customer in Argentina accounted for approximately 21% of our total revenue and 98% of the revenue generated from our operations in Argentina.
 
In 2018, we negotiated with our primary customer in Argentina to improve the terms of our agreement with this customer. In June 2018, we finalized the terms of a transition agreement with improved commercial terms. The transition agreement became effective in May 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2018, we did not provide any services to our primary customer in Argentina under the transition agreement or otherwise, and we did not generate any material revenue from our Argentina operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Customer demand for our services depended primarily upon the capital and operating spending of oil and gas exploration and production companies and the level of drilling activity in the regions we serve. A significant portion of our revenue came from a relatively small number of customers.
 
Competition
 
During a portion of 2018, we provided services in the U.S. and Argentina, both highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather and general economic conditions. We believe the principal competitive factors are price, performance, service quality, safety, response time and breadth of services. During 2018, our primary competitors in Argentina included Schlumberger, Halliburton, Weatherford, Baker Hughes, Calfrac Well Services and San Antonio International and other oilfield service companies. During a portion of 2018, in the United States, we competed against many of the same competitors as in Argentina but in addition, we also faced strong competition from many independent pressure pumping companies. We also competed with various other regional and local providers within each of our geographic markets for products and services.
Markets
 
United States
 
In May 2017, our first U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma. In October 2017, our second U.S. spread commenced operations in Oklahoma. The market in this region has been concentrated around wells being drilled in the Scoop, Stack, Cana-Woodford, Mississippian Lime and Springer plays. Activity in this region accelerated in late 2016 and 2017, and on into the first quarter of 2018. According to Baker Hughes’ North America Rotary Rig Count data, in early March 2018 there were 124 rigs operating in Oklahoma as compared to 98 rigs operating in early March 2017. Rig count in Oklahoma was 108 at the end of March 2019, dropping from 140 rigs operating at the end of 2018.
Argentina
 
We operated an oilfield services business in Argentina since December 2014. Our first full year of operations was 2015. During 2018, we marketed three service offerings in Argentina: (1) pressure pumping, (2) coiled tubing and (3) field management. The majority of our revenue came from the pressure pumping market which can be broken into three sub-markets, (1) conventional wells, (2) tight gas wells and (3) unconventional wells. Generally, the conventional wells were serviced with 3-5 pumping units whereas the tight gas wells required 8-10 pumping units. The unconventional wells in Argentina required anywhere from 16 to 24 pumping units. In 2015, we had sufficient pumping capacity to participate in the conventional well market. In 2016, we expanded our capacity and had the capacity to serve customers in the tight gas market. In the second quarter of 2017, we entered into a two-year contract with the largest operator in Argentina to provide services for their tight gas completions program. During the course of providing services under that contract, we incurred losses due to lower than expected utilization of our assets, higher than expected third-party costs incurred in order to provide the bundled services contemplated under the contract, and other factors. We engaged in negotiations with our primary customer in Argentina to improve the terms of the agreement, and in June 2018, we finalized the terms of a transition agreement with improved commercial terms. We operated under the transition agreement with our primary customer in Argentina beginning May 2018 and we continued to provide services under that agreement during the third quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2018, we have not provided any services to our primary customer in Argentina under the transition agreement or otherwise, and we did not generate any material revenue from our Argentina operations since the third quarter of 2018.
 
Our coiled tubing services supported our pressure pumping business, including the drill out of frac plugs, wash-downs, chemical treatments and workover activity. We provided these services to the conventional, tight gas and unconventional well markets in Argentina.

In 2018, our field management business consisted of various degrees of subsurface analysis derived from the data received from clients or otherwise acquired. The different forms of data include geophysical, geo-mechanical, core samples and other information provided by our customers and data acquired, processed and interpreted by our team including real time fiber optic information data gathered from pressure gauges installed in the wells. This market was driven by exploration and step-out development in new regions or in mature areas where our customers look to better understand the production associated with older wells.
 
The Baker Hughes rig count noted drilling rig count in Argentina peaked at 113 in 2014, bottomed at 52 in January 2017 and was 68 in January 2018. During 2018, rig count topped at 75 rigs in September and ended the year with 74. The rig count is an indicator of activity in Argentina which typically drives the utilization and pricing of services we provided.
 
Potential Liabilities and Insurance
 
Prior to the suspension in September 2018 of our U.S. well stimulation operations and significant reduction of our U.S. workforce, our operations involved a high degree of operational risk and exposed us to significant liabilities. As we continued into the fourth quarter of 2018 with our pump down operations, we continued to be exposed to significant liabilities. Even with the discontinuation of operations in Argentina in the fourth quarter of 2018, we continued to be exposed to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, or well blowout, could result in substantial claims for damages.
 
We maintained insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all the operating risks to which our business was exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. Our insurance program included, among other things, general liability, excess liability, sudden and accidental pollution, contractors’ pollution, equipment floater, commercial property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, employment practices liability, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery. Currently, we have scaled back our coverages to match with our lower or no activity levels (operational activity, reduced headcount, etc.), but maintaining coverage that we believe is sufficient to protect the Company from continued risks associated with the discontinuation of our operations.


Government Regulation
 
Our business is significantly affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 

● | worker safety standards; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the protection of the environment; 
● | the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; 
● | the protection of natural and cultural resources; and 
● | the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites. 

 
Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 
We cannot predict changes in the interpretation of, or changes to the policies adopted by governmental agencies in connection with the enforcement of, existing laws and regulations or how such laws, regulations and policies may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.

Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of natural resources. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations could have exposed us to significant costs and liabilities and could have caused us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to have complied with these laws and regulations could have resulted in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Although we have currently discontinued operations both in Argentina and in the U.S., we could remain liable for past activities. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future; however, we can provide no guarantee that this will not change.
 
The primary U.S. federal environmental laws to which our operations were subject include the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants in industrial wastewater and storm water runoff; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which imposes liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. We were also subject to regulation under the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. Analogous state and local laws and regulations could have also applied. Similar laws and regulations existed at the national and provincial level in Argentina.
 
In the last several years, there has been domestic and international scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities, resulting in additional regulation. Domestically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have finalized rules or made proposals that would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and could restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs for us or our customers, or delays in development or restrictions on our operations or the operations of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
In addition, from time to time regulators in both the U.S. and Argentina have taken steps to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases based on determinations by the scientific community that such emissions are contributing to climate change. Initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment and could indirectly affect us by increasing operating costs for our customers. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Severe limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas, which could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.

Raw Materials
 
During 2018, we purchased various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our services. These materials were generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and were subject to price volatility. While we generally did not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we had from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials.
Cyclical Nature of Our Industry
 
We operated in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor that drove demand for our services and that drives demand in our industry is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas is critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally result in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions are capable of temporarily impairing our operations by reducing our ability to operate for certain time periods, thereby reducing demand for our services.

Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 97 employees, all of which were full-time employees. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of our Argentine employees and none of our U.S. employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. As of April 15, 2019, we have approximately 9 employees in Argentina. As a result of our termination of all field level employees in the U.S., as of April 15, 2019, we had approximately 5 employees.
