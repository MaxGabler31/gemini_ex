 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
We are engaged in the design, construction, and sale of new homes in markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Alabama, California, Oregon, Nevada, West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Our management team has been in the residential land development business since the mid-1990s. Since commencing home building operations in 2003, we have constructed and closed over 50,000 homes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had 10,442 home closings, compared to 9,339 home closings in 2020.
LGI Homes, Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated on July 9, 2013. Our principal executive offices are located at 1450 Lake Robbins Drive, Suite 430, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number is (281) 362-8998. Information on or linked to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires, “LGI,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer collectively to LGI Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Business Opportunities
Since our initial public offering in November 2013, we have grown substantially by expanding our operations from nine markets in four states to 35 markets in 19 states. We believe there is an opportunity to continue to grow in our existing markets. Given our knowledge of and proven success in these markets, as well as the favorable demographic and economic trends forecasted for these markets, we expect to continue to grow in our current markets. 
We intend to continue to expand into new markets where we identify opportunities to build homes and develop communities that meet our profit and return objectives. One of the keys to our successful geographic expansion is our operating model which enables us to enter new markets efficiently and effectively. During 2022, we expect to continue operating in our existing markets and expect to continue land development in Utah.
In addition to our geographic expansion, we have significantly diversified our operations, offering multiple entry-level product lines, including attached and detached homes as well as active adult offerings, which are sold under our LGI Homes brand, and our luxury series homes, which are sold under our Terrata Homes brand, as well as our wholesale business that builds and sells homes to companies looking to acquire single-family rental properties, primarily through bulk sales agreements. In addition, our recently announced joint venture, LGI Mortgage Solutions, will have the opportunity to facilitate financing for the majority of our customers. At December 31, 2021, we had 93 active communities with our LGI Homes brand and eight with our Terrata Homes brand. To further assess diversification within our operations during 2021, we also began offering a limited number of single-family rental homes in select communities with the intent to ultimately sell these homes through a bulk purchase.
Our Terrata Homes brand allows us to leverage our systems and process approach, including our customer centric sales system, to deliver move-in ready homes with standardized features. During 2021, we closed 183 Terrata Homes, which had an average sales price per home closed of $482,410, compared to 150 Terrata Homes, which had an average sales price per home closed of $424,132, in 2020.
Our attached townhome product in certain markets enables us to keep our entry-level price point within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that our attached townhome product helps to counter rising land and home costs, and supports our expansion into more densely populated markets. 
Our active adult communities offer both open and age-restricted lifestyles in amenity-rich communities with affordable homes. The communities leverage existing floor plans with minor modifications that present a compelling value-proposition, convenience and comfort for the product line’s target demographic.
Additionally, we believe the creation of LGI Mortgage Solutions, a joint venture with one of our long-time, third-party preferred lenders, will facilitate a more streamlined, customer-focused mortgage financing experience for our homebuyers.
Our wholesale business provides opportunities for us to leverage our systems and processes to meet the needs of companies looking to acquire multiple homes for rental purposes, primarily through bulk sales agreements. During 2021 and 2020, we had 1,515 and 850 wholesale home closings, respectively, which represented 14.5% and 9.1% of our total home closings in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We expect to continue to pursue a flexible land acquisition strategy of purchasing or optioning finished lots at attractive prices, or purchasing raw land for residential development. We are experienced in converting raw land into residential communities, given our successful history as a land developer. We endeavor to maintain a pipeline of desirable land positions for replacement communities and new communities. We generally target land acquisitions that are further away from urban centers than many other suburban communities but have access to major thoroughfares, retail districts and centers of business. These target areas that are further away from urban centers generally result in a better value for the homeowner through either lower price points or larger lot sizes. We consider development opportunities that meet our profit and return objectives, including opportunities that may involve the sale of home sites as a part of the product mix. Projects of interest are typically evaluated at the division level using an extensive due diligence checklist that includes assessing the permitting and regulatory requirements, environmental considerations, local market conditions and anticipated floor plans, pricing and financial returns. We also determine the number of potential residents in the market and rental households that are within driving distance of the proposed project. We will continue to focus primarily on entry-level home buyers. We expect our wholesale business to represent approximately 10.0% of our annual home closings during 2022. Additionally, we expect that home closings in our Terrata Homes branded communities will be approximately 5.0% of our annual home closings during 2022.
Sales and Marketing 
Our well-defined sales and marketing approach is primarily focused on converting renters of apartments and single-family homes into homeowners. We use extensive digital and print advertising to attract potential homebuyers. We employ various marketing methods such as interactive online media, social media, direct mail and directional signage and billboards. These methods have proven highly successful in reaching our target market, placing potential homebuyers in front of our trained sales professionals and communicating our core messages of value and dream fulfillment.
While a proportion of our business comes from realtors, our marketing efforts are principally designed to connect directly with potential customers who are currently renting their residence and to encourage them to schedule an in-person appointment at one of our information centers. Our information centers are typically open 12 hours per day, 359 days per year, and generally staffed by two to five sales professionals who are supported by a dedicated, independent loan officer. 
Our commission-based sales professionals are trained to learn about the current housing situation of the customer, educate them on the value proposition of owning an LGI home and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of the steps required to achieve homeownership. We also educate customers on our history, vision and values. Our sales professionals determine credit and income qualifications, provide information regarding floor plans and pricing and conduct tours of our homes based on the customer’s needs and budget. We provide each customer with a comprehensive introduction to the community and the surrounding area, furnishing them with detailed information regarding utilities, schools, homeowners association dues and restrictions, local entertainment and nearby dining and shopping options. As a result of our transparent approach, customers receive all the information needed to make a buying decision, which we believe sets clear expectations and eliminates confusion during the home buying process. Currently, we do not sell a home until construction has begun on the home.
Homebuilding Operations
Our homebuilding operations are organized and managed by seven operating segments: West, Northwest, Central, Midwest, Florida, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. The Midwest division is included in our Central reportable segment and the Mid-Atlantic division is included in our Southeast reportable segment.
We operate in the following markets within these seven operating segments:

West | Northwest | Central | Midwest | Florida | Southeast | Mid-Atlantic 
Phoenix, AZ | Seattle, WA | Houston, TX | Minneapolis, MN | Tampa, FL | Atlanta, GA | Washington, D.C.
Tucson, AZ | Portland, OR | Dallas Ft. Worth, TX | | Orlando, FL | Charlotte, NC | Norfolk, VA 
Albuquerque, NM | Denver, CO | San Antonio, TX | | Fort Myers, FL | Raleigh, NC | Richmond, VA 
Las Vegas, NV | | Austin, TX | | Jacksonville, FL | Wilmington, NC | Baltimore, MD 
Northern CA | | Oklahoma City, OK | | Fort Pierce, FL | Winston-Salem, NC | 
Southern CA | | | | Daytona Beach, FL | Columbia, SC | 
 | | | | Sarasota, FL | Greenville, SC | 
 | | | | | Birmingham, AL | 
 | | | | | Nashville, TN | 

During 2021, we expanded our geographic presence in the Mid-Atlantic with the addition of Baltimore, Maryland and Norfolk, Virginia. These operating segments reflect the way we evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. Additional information on our operating segments and product information is contained in Note 15 “Segment Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our even-flow, continuous construction methodology enables us to build and maintain an inventory of move-in ready homes that are available for immediate sale. Driven by commitment to our customers and the desire to make dreams of homeownership come true, we offer a set number of floor plans in each community with standardized finishes.  In 2019, we introduced the CompleteHomeTM and CompleteHome PlusTM packages to continue our legacy of offering buyers beautiful move-in ready homes, a streamlined buying experience, and superior quality with even more standard features than offered before.
Each of these packages offers move-in ready homes with preselected, upgraded standard features, including stainless steel Whirlpool® appliances, cabinets with crown molding, granite or quartz countertops, undermount sinks, Moen® faucets and Kwikset® door hardware, as well as convenient outlets with USB charging capability and a Wi-Fi-enabled garage door opener. Additionally, both packages include programmable thermostats, double-pane Low-E vinyl windows, LED flush mount ENERGY STAR lights and a variety of other energy-saving features. Our CompleteHome Plus package includes everything in the CompleteHome package plus 42” upper cabinets, nine-foot ceilings, designer paint selections, enhanced landscaping selections and window blinds throughout the home. Our homes are designed to meet the preferences of our target market of potential homebuyers and enable cost efficient and effective construction processes. We maintained an average home completion time of approximately 90 to 130 days during 2021, with homes closed during 2021 ranging between 1,000 to 4,100 square feet and overall sales prices ranging between the $150,000’s to the $1,100,000’s.
We expect to continue to utilize our even flow construction methodology in communities with homes at all of our price points and will maintain our focus on marketing complete or move-in ready homes with standardized features.
We employ experienced construction management professionals to perform the tasks of general contractors for home construction in each of our communities. Our employees provide the purchasing, construction management and quality assurance for the homes we build, while third-party subcontractors provide the material and labor components of our homes. In each of our markets, we employ construction managers with local market knowledge and expertise. Additionally, our construction managers monitor our compliance with zoning, safety, and other regulations, production schedules, and quality standards for our projects.
We endeavor to obtain favorable pricing from subcontractors through long-term relationships and consistent workflow. As we have expanded into new markets outside of Texas, many employees that we have hired in those markets have brought with them long-term relationships with subcontracting firms. We have also expanded upon existing relationships with subcontracting firms located in Texas. A number of our trade partners have subcontracted on our projects since we commenced homebuilding 
operations in 2003. We purchase some components and materials centrally to leverage our purchasing power to achieve volume discounts, a practice that often reduces costs and ensures timely deliveries. We typically do not store significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. Consistency of our trade partners is an integral part of our homebuilding operations that also leads to reduced warranty costs. We believe in building long lasting relationships with our trade partners in order to provide consistent, quality and timely deliveries across our markets. We also work closely with our construction managers and subcontractors and train them using a comprehensive construction manual that outlines the most efficient way to build an LGI home.
Throughout our homebuilding operations, we utilize a paperless purchase order system to conduct business with our subcontractors and suppliers. Our master build schedule allows our trade partners to receive their specific tasks from our electronic system and plan several weeks in advance before starting their work. This means of communication allows our subcontractors to schedule their crews efficiently, thereby allowing for better pricing and better quality of work. Typically, our contractors are paid every week, which contributes to the strength of our business relationships with them.
Land Acquisition Policies and Development
We continue to be an active and opportunistic acquirer of land for residential development in our markets. We source land from a wide range of landowners, brokers, lenders, builders and other land development companies. We generally acquire raw land and finished lots in affordable locations that are further away from urban centers than many other suburban communities but have access to major thoroughfares, retail districts and centers of business. We conduct thorough due diligence on each of our potential land acquisitions, and we typically look at numerous opportunities before finding one that meets our requirements. We also maintain a pipeline of desirable land positions for replacement communities and new communities. Our lot inventory increased to 91,845 owned or controlled lots as of December 31, 2021 from 61,504 owned or controlled lots as of December 31, 2020 due to overall increased lot count within all reportable segments. We decreased our active communities to 101 as of December 31, 2021 from 116 as of December 31, 2020. During 2021, we experienced a decrease in our overall active community count driven by the accelerated pace of absorptions, the time lag between the closing out of certain communities and the readiness of replacement communities and limited availability of finished lots in certain markets in 2021 as compared to 2020. We expect this trend to continue in the beginning of 2022 until additional new communities are ready to become active communities (i.e., home construction has begun in the community and a home has closed in the community).
Our allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to portfolio management. Our Acquisitions Committee meets periodically and consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President of Acquisitions. Annually, our divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographic areas. Supply and demand are analyzed to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. The long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to our experience in the marketplace and is then adjusted to the extent necessary. 
We have also purchased larger tracts of land across our markets which will provide us with more opportunities to build homes with multiple price points in our communities. We believe that our land development expertise will allow us to meet our growth and profit objectives with respect to opportunities in which we are the developer. Similar to our home building operations, our personnel oversee the contractors who perform the development work. Our land development projects may include the sale of home sites or commercial property as a part of the project.
We have strong relationships with the land brokerage community in many of our markets. We believe that in the brokerage community we have a reputation for knowing our business, having the capital to close deals, and making accurate and timely decisions that benefit both the buyer and seller. For these reasons, we believe that brokers routinely notify us when desirable tracts of land are available for purchase.
In our land acquisition process, projects of interest are evaluated at the division level using an extensive due diligence checklist which includes assessing the permitting and regulatory requirements, environmental considerations, local market conditions, and anticipated floor plans, pricing, and financial returns. We also acquire and develop land for use in our wholesale business. 
The table below shows (i) home closings by reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) our owned or controlled lots by reportable segment as of December 31, 2021. 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2021 | As of December 31, 2021
Reportable Segment | Home Closings | Owned (1) | | Controlled | Total 
Central | 4,665 | | 23,034 | | 14,761 | 37,795
Southeast | 2,279 | | 15,386 | | 5,616 | 21,002

Total | 10,442 | | 54,867 | | 36,978 | 91,845

(1)Of the 54,867 owned lots as of December 31, 2021, 42,743 were raw/under development lots and 12,124 were finished lots.
Homes in Inventory
When entering a new community, we intend to build a sufficient number of move-in ready homes to meet our budgets. We base future home starts on home closings. As homes are closed, we start more homes to maintain our inventory. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 683 completed homes, including information centers, and 3,026 homes in progress.
The following is a summary of our homes in inventory by reportable segment as of December 31, 2021 (dollar values in thousands):

Reportable Segment | Homes in Inventory (1) | Inventory Value (1)
Central | 1,534 | | $ | 224,428
Southeast | 605 | | 77,513 | 
Northwest | 333 | | 81,997 | 
West | 504 | | 92,157 | 
Florida | 617 | | 81,383 | 
Total | 3,593 | | $ | 557,478

Backlog
See discussion included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Backlog.”
Raw Materials and Labor
When constructing homes, we use various materials and components. We generally contract for our materials and labor at a fixed price for the anticipated construction period of our homes. This allows us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in building materials and labor costs between the time construction begins on a home and the time it is closed. Typically, the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. In addition, the majority of our raw materials is supplied to us by our subcontractors, and is included in the price of our contract with such subcontractors. Most of the raw materials necessary for our subcontractors are standard items carried by major suppliers. Substantially all of our construction work is done by third-party subcontractors, most of whom are non-unionized. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. Typically, the price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in labor, commodities and lumber. We could see additional cost pressures associated with lumber in future quarters. Generally, we have been able to increase the sales prices of our homes to absorb these increased costs.
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the beginning of 2022, significant supply chain disruptions extended construction cycles across our markets. We have focused on our supply chain and have endeavored to manage it to limit impacts to our business and customers. We believe these global shortages are directly related to the novel strain of coronavirus (including new variants thereof, “COVID-19”) and will continue to impact our operations as long as the pandemic 
persists. Although we expect COVID-19 to continue to influence our future results, we believe that the desire for single-family homes outside of densely populated urban areas combined with historically low mortgage rates and low availability of existing homes is driving an increase in demand for new homes.
Seasonality
The homebuilding industry generally exhibits seasonality. We have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. See discussion included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality.” 
Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters, which impose zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes or mandate the type of structure that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, health and safety. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. These executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, whether the site contains wetlands or other features that may create burdensome permitting requirements, its environmental conditions, the present and former uses of the site, the presence or absence of endangered plants or species or sensitive habitats, and environmental conditions at adjoining or nearby properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers’ and homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties, among other sanctions, for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in delays. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held strictly and/or jointly and severally liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including property damage or bodily injury, and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation plan may be implemented during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition, such as methane or radon. Some homebuyers may not want to purchase a home that is, or may have been, subject to a mitigation plan.
Competition
The U.S. homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We also compete with sales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage financing terms and location. There has been some consolidation among national homebuilders in the United States, and we expect that this trend may continue.
Human Capital Resources
LGI Homes is committed to being a people-focused organization and actively promotes a workplace of dignity and respect for all. We strive to uphold all applicable laws and regulations in the markets where we conduct business and pursue business relationships with external partners who share our commitment to lawful, ethical business conduct. We believe our commitments to diversity and inclusion, training, safety and sustainability form the foundation of our people-focused culture.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 952 people, of whom 87 were located at our corporate headquarters. Of our employees located outside our corporate headquarters, 528 were on-site sales and support personnel, and 337 were involved with acquisition and development, purchasing, and construction. We have built a diverse and inclusive team of professionals with a wide range of industry experience across our markets. We are dedicated to supporting our employees when times are challenging. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We believe we have good relations with our employees. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, training, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. 
We utilize subcontractors and tradespeople to perform the construction of our homes. We believe we have good relations with our subcontractors and tradespeople.
Diversity, equity and inclusion. We are committed to equal employment and advancement opportunities for all individuals regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status or status as a covered veteran in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. As of December 31, 2021, our workforce at our corporate headquarters was comprised of 65% women and 28% identified as racially or ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2021, our on-site sales, sales support and construction workforce located outside of our corporate headquarters was comprised of 25% women and 32% identified as racially or ethnically diverse. 
We are committed to maintaining a workplace that is respectful to all individuals and we maintain a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment of any kind. Any conduct that creates an offensive or intimidating environment runs counter to our culture and core values and is strictly prohibited. This policy is expressly described in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Employee Handbook and includes, but is not limited to, any protected status or characteristic, including race, color, ethnicity or national origin, age, sex, religion, disability, marital status, status as a veteran, genetic information, or any other status or characteristic protected by any federal, state, or local law. Our employees are expected to treat their coworkers, our business partners’ employees and our customers with dignity and respect.
Commitment to recruitment, training and advancement. We focus on identifying and attracting the best talent and providing those individuals with world-class training and continuous development. We directly invest in our sales professionals by conducting an intensive 100-day introductory training program consisting of 30 days of initial in-depth, in-house education about our time-proven selling strategies, which includes a one-week training program at our headquarters, and secondary training at the local division. Our continued commitment to our sales personnel is reflected in the ongoing weekly training sessions held in each of our information centers and quarterly regional training events. Typically, all employees including construction managers, purchasing managers and vice presidents come to our corporate headquarters for a week of training in their first 100 days. We also work closely with our subcontractors and tradespeople, training them on the most efficient way to build an LGI home. A number of our subcontractors and tradespeople have worked on our homes since we commenced homebuilding operations in 2003 and, therefore, are familiar with our business model.
Employee wellness, health and safety. We are committed to providing competitive benefits to attract and retain employees, including benefits that facilitate healthy lifestyles, mental well-being and preparedness for retirement. Our commitment to wellness, health and safety was demonstrated by our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, we announced we would not lay off or furlough employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2020, we paid a special bonus to our “frontline” workers whose roles and responsibilities required that they directly interact with the public on a daily basis. The bonus was in recognition of the extraordinary efforts of such workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are committed to creating a safe and secure business environment that protects the health and safety of our employees, business partners and customers. Our workplaces are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as they pertain to health and safety in the workplace. As part of this commitment, we have implemented a systems-based program of regularly scheduled safety reviews, meetings and continuing education that are held in our communities and include our employees and the employees of our subcontractors and tradespeople.
Commitment to community involvement and support. We are committed to improving and giving back to the communities we serve. In addition to ongoing charitable giving throughout the year, each June we close all offices nationwide for our Service Impact Day. During this annual service event, our focus turns away from sales and home closings as we dedicate the entire day to giving back. Every LGI employee spends the day volunteering in the local community. From constructing fences and cleaning up parks, organizing food, and volunteering at children's clubs, we are committed to being a positive presence in the communities we build. Since 2016, we have contributed over $1.8 million in corporate, non-profit sponsorships, donated over 20,000 employee service hours and collaborated with over 100 non-profit organizations in an effort to make a meaningful impact in our local communities.
