ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated under the name Creative Learning Products, Inc. in the State of New Jersey on August 31, 1988 and changed its name to Creative Gaming, Inc. in May 1997. The Company changed its name to Management Services, Inc. in October 2006. In August 2008, the Company changed its name to Centriforce Technology Corp. In May 2010, the Company changed its name to ADB International Group, Inc. The Company changed its name to its current name, E-Qure Corp., on August 27, 2014.
 
On May 12, 2014, the board of directors approved a plan to redomicile from the State of New Jersey to the State of Delaware. In conjunction with the change in domicile the board of directors also approve a 1:100 reverse split of our Common Stock. The redomicile and reverse split were approved by FINRA and became effective on August 4, 2014.
 
Our Business
 
We are a medical device Company planning to commercialize our Bioelectrical Signal Therapy device (“BST Device,” or “Device”). Our BST Device treats wounds via electrical stimulation, which is believed to result in accelerated wound healing by imitating the natural electrical current that occurs in injured skin on the human body. Our BST Device stimulates renewed blood flow and oxygen in order to induce local cell regeneration and therefore promote wound healing. Our mission is to improve non-invasive wound care treatments and to become a leading provider of non-invasive wound and ulcer healing treatment. Our device is designed to specifically address many of the limitations associated with other invasive and non-invasive wound care devices.
 
We believe our BST Device is a simple and effective wound heal method that can be used in and incorporated as an adjunctive therapy in wound healing. Treatment is safe, effective, and well-tolerated.
 
Our BST Device has the Communaute Europeenne (“CE”) mark and is approved to be sold in the EU market. We are planning to initiate a FDA clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which we reasonably believe should commence in the third quarter of 2019. The costs related to this clinical trial is expected to be approximately $1.8 million. We estimate that the initial phase of the first 10 patients (out of 90) to cost $200K.
 
The Company’s success greatly depends upon the successful FDA clinical trial of its BST Device as well as our ability to raise sufficient equity capital through our pending Rights Offering Registrations Statement from which we are expected to receive approximately $500,000 (not including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants included as part of the Unit Rights Offering. The Device may need additional development and there can be no assurance that we will, in fact, achieve the requisite safety and efficacy, prerequisites for FDA approval and/or that FDA approval will be received in a timely manner, if at all. Nevertheless, the Company believes that its BST Device’s design and procedure is safe and effective, but the path to commercial success in the US, even if FDA approval is granted, may take more time and may be more costly that we expect or for which we have sufficient resources at the present.
 
Our BST Device is designed to treat chronic wounds – primarily Stage III and Stage IV ulcers, which we believe comprises about 11% and 7% of all chronic wounds, respectively, and severe Stage II wounds.
 
Our anticipated plan to be able to sell the BST Device commercially in the United States, assuming success in our FDA approval process, is not expected before the end of 2019. We have not generated any sales revenues from our BST Device to date other than the payment of US$40,000 we have received from Colombia in January 2018 representing an initial order for our BST Device.

Our Wound Healing Strategy
 
The objective of our BST Device is to reduce healing time and allow patients to receive treatment at home while delivering optimal therapeutic results, which eventually should result in significantly higher healing rates along with lower wound treatment costs presently available on the market.
 
The costs associated with untreated and/or unhealed wounds are far in excess of the costs of the physician, hospital and medical equipment, particularly when there are subsequent complications that require additional medical treatment which are virtually certain to occur as a result of untreated and/or unhealed wounds in a patient.
 
The healing time of chronic wounds usually ranges from a few weeks to up to several months depending on the size and type of the wound and the patient’s medical condition. Wound treatment typically can involve many direct and indirect costs. Wound dressings comprise only 10-15% of the total direct treatment cost according to the International Committee of Wound Management. In contrast, a significant percentage of the total cost is attributable to care providers’ salaries and staff expenses. As a result, treatment methods that reduce healing time to closure of the wound and reduce staff time inevitably lead to lower cost of care.
 
We believe that our BST Device is a very effective and cost-saving method for the chronic wound treatment market. Our belief is based on the knowledge and experience of our management in the wound care industry that our BST Device is designed to be able to significantly lower treatment cost compared to other wound therapies modalities due to the fact that our wound heal method requires shorter healing times, treatment can be easily given at patient homes and therefore reduce per day treatment costs.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company intends to launch marketing efforts in the US assuming receipt of FDA approval which we anticipate during 2019, of which there can be no assurance. Until such time, most of our efforts will be related to internally preparing for the launch of our BST Device in the US as well as proceeding with marketing efforts in the EU, Colombia, Argentina and a few other territories.
 
Assuming FDA approval, which we reasonably believe can be achieved by end of 2019 based, in part, because of approval that our BST Device been received in Europe, the Company plans to indirectly sell its wound treatment solution by entering into distribution agreements with distributors specializing in wound care therapy solutions or by creating its own sales and marketing force. The distributors or the C ompany will then sell the treatment to hospitals, nursing homes, geriatric institutions and private wound care clinics.
 
In addition to indirect sales through distribution agreements, the Company considers the outright sale of its treatment to each institution such as hospitals, nursing homes, geriatric institutions, and private clinics, which would rent the Device to their patients on a monthly basis. Upon completion of the wound healing treatment, the patient would return the Device, which would then re-enter the medical device rental market.
 
Competition
 
Our principal competition in the chronic wound care market are expected to be the wound care products manufactured by Acelity (formerly known as KCI) and Smith & Nephew. Acelity is considered a market leader and, we believe, commands a market share of approximately 21% in the United States. Smith & Nephew’s U.S. market share is believed to be approximately 19% based on revenues. Other significant competitors are ConvaTec, Johnson & Johnson and others, all manufacturers of wound healing devices.
 
We also face competition from numerous companies that offer a variety of wound healing methods including traditional wound care dressings, advanced wound care dressings, such as hydrogels, hydrocolloids, and alginates, skin substitutes, and products containing growth factors. While many of these methods compete with our BST Device, such methods can also be utilized as complementary therapies to our BST Device and V is versa.
 
We believe that the following treatments or therapies represent alternatives or complementary treatments and/or therapies to our BST device:
 
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (“HBOT”): Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a medical treatment that utilizes pressurized oxygen to heal wounds. The treatment is administered by placing a patient in a comfortable pressure chamber that circulates oxygen at two to three times the atmospheric pressure rate. The HBOT method is not specifically designed for chronic wounds and the treatment process is both very long and very expensive. HBOT treatments typically last 90-120 minutes and are administered 1-2 times a daily for a period of 5 to 6 days a week. The length of treatment depends on the wound’s severity, with some patients requiring 20-40 treatments. There are many companies that offer HBOT treatment in clinics as a direct service to patients.
 
Vacuum-assisted closure (“V.A.C.”) method: The V.A.C. method is designed for the treatment of acute care setting, serious trauma wounds, failed surgical closures, amputations, and serious pressure ulcers. The leading V.A.C. product was launched in 1995 by KCI, a major global medical technology company, recently acquired by Acelity.
 
EZCARE (Smith & Nephew) - Following the acquisition of BlueSky Medical in May 2007, Smith & Nephew provide negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). NPWT is a technology used to treat chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, as well as post-operative and hard-to-heal wounds. It aids in the healing of open wounds by the application of sub-atmospheric pressure (Similar technology to KCI).

In addition, recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, are or may be the basis for products which compete with our BST Device. There can be given no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into the chronic wound heal market with our BST Device or that we will be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future.
 
Many of these companies have substantially greater capital and marketing resources, and greater experience in commercializing products and services than we have.
 
Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights
 
We have a list of all pending and granted patents to date attached as exhibit 10.9 to our S-1 Registration Statement as filed with the Company’s S-1 on September 6, 2014. To the extent that we determine that additional intellectual property (“IP”) protection may be necessary, we plan to secure such protection by applying for additional patents, trademarks or copyrights related to our business and IP, as we deem necessary.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations and the marketing of our BST Device is subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, foremost of which is the FDA. There can be no assurance that the FDA, other governmental agencies or a third party will not contend that certain aspects of our business and our BST Device is either subject to or is not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations or rules or that the state or federal regulatory agencies or courts would interpret such laws, regulations and rules in our favor. The sanctions for failure to comply with such laws, regulations or rules could include denial of the right to conduct business, significant fines and criminal and civil penalties. Additionally, any increase in the complexity or substantive requirements of such laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Any change in current regulatory requirements or related interpretations by or positions of, state officials where we operate could adversely affect our operations within those states. State regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to establish operations in such other states.
 
Timeline and Estimated Costs for Regulatory FDA Approval of Our BST Device
 
We expect FDA approval of our BST Device during 2019 after total costs and expenses of approximately $1.5 million. We have received IDE approval from the FDA which involved a more lengthy process and are currently preparing to commence our clinical trial in the U.S. To that end, we have engaged IMARC Research Inc., a leading clinical research organization located in Ohio, to conduct our Randomized Control Trial (RCT) based upon a monthly payment schedule with payments determined by the amount of work provided, the number of patients enrolled to the study and the expenses incurred IMARC during the RCT.
 
Based upon our current estimations, which we believe are based on sound business analysis after consultation with IMARC, we expect that we should be able to complete: (i) the first phase of the RCT with 10 patients by the end of Q4 2018; and (ii) the second phase of the RCT with 80 patients by the end of Q4 2019, depending on patient enrollment rate. We will incur fixed costs during the RCT and additional costs paid to IMARC and other service providers based upon the time devoted during the RCT process.
 
Various state and federal laws apply to the operations of medical device providers including, but are not limited to, the following:
 
Licensing Requirements: Certain medical device providers are required to be licensed by various state regulatory bodies. However, if we are found to not be in compliance, we could be subject to fines and penalties or ordered to cease operations which could have an adverse effect on our business.
 
False Claims Act: The Federal False Claims Act and some state laws impose requirements in connection with the submission of claims for payment for health care services and products, including prohibiting the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims and submission of false records or statements for reimbursement and payment to the United States government or state government. Such requirements would apply to the hospitals to which we provide our Device related to wound care treatment services. Not only are government agencies active in investigating and enforcing actions with respect to applicable health laws, but also health care providers are often subject to actions brought by individuals on behalf of the government. As such, “whistleblower” lawsuits, also known as “qui tam” actions, are generally filed under seal with a court to allow the government adequate time to investigate and determine whether it will intervene in the action. As a result, health care providers subject to qui tam actions are often unaware of the lawsuit until the government has made its determination whether to intervene, or not, at which time the seal is lifted. The Federal False Claims Act provides for penalties equal to three (3) times the actual amount of any overpayments plus $11,000 per claim. Under legislation passed in 2009, those who bill third parties are now obligated to discover and disclose any overpayments received or be subject to False Claims Act penalties as well.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws: Since a significant portion of reimbursement for healthcare products and services are currently paid through reimbursements under Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, the federal government and many states have adopted statutes and regulations that address fraudulent and/or abusive behavior in connection with such programs.
 
As part of this regulatory scheme, the federal government believes that an “inducement” to refer a Medicare or Medicaid patient is likely to result in fraud or abuse on the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Therefore, the federal government adopted a number of laws and regulations to recoup funds and assess penalties which it believes were paid inappropriately. In cases of criminal fraud, the individuals responsible for the fraudulent activity can be subject to imprisonment.

One of the principal federal statutes regulating fraud and abuse is the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback statute prohibits the solicitation, payment, receipt or offering of any direct or indirect remuneration in exchange for the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients or for the purchasing, arranging for or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of Medicare or Medicaid covered services, items or equipment. To be convicted of a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the party must have had specific intent to induce the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients or the purchase, lease or ordering of a good, item or service reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Some of the federal courts have broadly construed the Anti-Kickback Statute and held that the “intent” required to support a criminal conviction will exist if only one purpose of the referral is to induce a prohibited referral.
 
To clarify some of the issues created by the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued “safe harbor” regulations identifying actions which will not be deemed to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these “safe harbors” are in the area of joint ventures, personal services, and other arrangements. Conducting an activity that falls within a “safe harbor” regulation provides comfort that such activity will not be prosecuted. Compliance with each element of a particular “safe harbor” is required in order to assured of the protection provided by such “safe harbor”. Even though a transaction that does not fall within a “safe harbor” may be perfectly appropriate, the arrangement will be evaluated based on its facts and circumstances to determine if the parties intended to induce the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients or the purchase, lease or ordering of a good, item or service reimbursable under Medicare or Medicaid.
 
An allegation of violation and/or a conviction for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and parallel state laws could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our business. As noted earlier, significant fines, penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and imprisonment of individuals can result. Because the burden to prove specific intent under the Anti-Kickback Statute can sometimes be difficult, the government has been pursuing enforcement under statutes that do not require specific intent such as the False Claims Act. In fact, in recent legislation the Congress has required that those submitting claims for third party reimbursement are required to discover and repay any overpayments, or they are subject to additional penalties.
 
The Stark Law: Federal and some state laws prohibit physician referrals to an entity in which the physician or his or her immediate family members have a financial interest for provision of certain designated health services that are reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. We cannot assure you that the federal government, or other states in which we operate, will not enact similar or more restrictive legislation or restrictions or interpret existing laws and regulations in a manner that could harm our business.
 
Health Care Reform: There are currently a number of legislative proposals that have been proposed as health care reform in the United States Congress. At this time, it is not clear which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted. Therefore, although one or more of these proposals, if enacted, could have an impact on our business, we cannot predict at this time what that impact will be until there is legislation that becomes law.
 
Ongoing Investigations: Federal and state investigations and enforcement actions continue to focus on the health care industry, scrutinizing a wide range of items such as joint venture arrangements and referral and billing practices. We believe planned activities will be substantially in compliance with applicable legal requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that a governmental agency or a third party will not contend that certain aspects of our business are subject to, or are not in compliance with, such laws, regulations or rules, or that state or federal regulatory agencies or courts would interpret such laws, regulations and rules in our favor, or that future interpretations of such laws will not require structural or organizational modifications of our business or have a negative impact on our business. Applicable laws and regulations are very broad and complex, and, in many cases, the courts interpret them differently, making compliance difficult. Although we try to comply with such laws, regulations and rules, a violation could result in denial of the right to conduct business, significant fines and criminal penalties. Additionally, an increase in the complexity or substantive requirements of such laws, regulations or rules, or reform of the structure of health care delivery systems and payment methods, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
