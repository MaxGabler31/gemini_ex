ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development
Cardinal Ethanol, LLC is an Indiana limited liability company formed on February 7, 2005 with the name of Indiana Ethanol, LLC. On September 27, 2005, we changed our name to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Cardinal” and the “Company” refer to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. We began producing ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at the plant in November 2008 (the "Ethanol Division"). In addition, in 2017 we added a facility to allow us to procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our new grain operations (the "Trading Division"). 
    On January 20, 2022, we entered into an Equipment Purchase and Installation Agreement (the "EPC Agreement") with ICM, Inc. pursuant to which ICM has agreed to engineer, procure, construct, and install its high protein feed system and license to us its proprietary, patent-protected technology to use, operate and maintain the system. Pursuant to the EPC Agreement and subsequent adjustments due to change orders executed by the parties, we expect to pay approximately $50,000,000, including recent change orders, which is payable in installments. This price is subject to further adjustment in the event additional change orders are executed. We will also pay license fees of $10 per ton of PROTOMAX™ produced by the system for a period of 10 years. We expect to fund the project from operations and from our current credit facilities as amended. We began installation of the system during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022. This project is expected to be completed by Fall of 2023.
On March 30, 2022, we executed an Eighteenth Amendment of First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement, to be effective as of February 28, 2022, which amended the First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement dated June 10, 2013 (the "Amendment"). The primary purposes of the Amendment are to provide additional financing to fund the construction and installation of a system to produce high protein feed at the plant and extend the termination date of the Revolving Credit Loan to February 28, 2023. Please refer to Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9 - Bank Financing for more information.
On May 23, 2022, we received an award from the USDA Biofuel Producer Program of approximately $7,652,000. 
On September 14, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, LLC (the "Murex Amendment"). The Murex Amendment amends the Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 18, 2006, as amended. The Murex Amendment is effective on December 1, 2022. Please refer to Item 1 - Business - Reportable Operating Segments - Ethanol Division for more information.
We have engaged with an unrelated third party to pursue the possible joint development of integrated carbon dioxide facilities, transportation infrastructure and a carbon sequestration site for the carbon dioxide emissions produced by our plant (the "CCS Project"). We performed an initial study and assessment of the technical and economic feasibility of the CCS Project and optimal commercial structure. As a result, we decided to organize a joint venture entity along with the third party to take certain steps towards implementing the CCS Project including filing the application for the necessary permitting and acquiring rights from landowners that will be needed in order to complete the CCS Project. In addition, we have granted certain rights to the joint venture including a surface easement and a lease of pore space below the surface of our property for use in sequestration if the CCS Project is successful. However, the CCS Project is still in its early stages and is subject to many variables that could have a material effect on its feasibility and our ability to construct and complete the CCS Project. Please refer to Item 8 - Financial Statements - Note 16 - Equity Method Investments for more information.
Reportable Operating Segments

    Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Based on the nature of the products, services and operations and the expected financial results, we review our operations within the following two separate operating segments: (1) ethanol production through our Ethanol Division; and (2) trading of agricultural grains through our Trading Division. We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines 
of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and the trading of agricultural grains. 

Ethanol Division
In October 2020, we obtained a new Title V air permit allowing us to increase our annual ethanol production to 175 million gallons compared to 140 million gallons under our previous permit. Our annual ethanol production rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35% above the nameplate capacity for the plant.  
    Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We market and sell ethanol and its co-products (distillers grains and corn oil) primarily in the continental United States using third party marketers. Murex, LLC markets all of our ethanol. Our distillers grains are marketed by CHS, Inc. We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers.    
Principal Products
The principal products in our Ethanol Division are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil and capturing a portion of the raw carbon dioxide we produce for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total ethanol division revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2022 | | Fiscal Year 2021 | | Fiscal Year 2020
Ethanol | 80 | % | | 77 | % | 75 | %
Distillers Grains | 14 | % | | 18 | % | 20 | %
Corn Oil | 6 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %
Carbon Dioxide | < 1% | | < 1 % | | < 1% 

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. 
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called “beer,” which contains about 10% alcohol and 90% water. The “beer” is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable. 
Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95% of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender. The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the northeastern United States.
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, beef, poultry and swine industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distillers grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles ("DWS"), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles ("DMWS") and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles ("DDGS"). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70% moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS have a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and are often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to 10% to 12% moisture. 
DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant. 
Corn Oil
Since November 2008, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. We have worked hard to improve corn oil production levels and continue to fine tune the operation of our equipment to further increase production rates. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses. 
Carbon Dioxide
    Since March 2010, we have been selling some of the carbon dioxide gas produced at the plant. 
Ethanol, Distillers Grains, Corn Oil and Carbon Dioxide Markets
As described below in "Distribution Methods," we market and distribute our ethanol and distillers grains through third parties. Our ethanol and distillers grains marketers make all decisions, in consultation with management, with regard to where our products are marketed. Our ethanol and distillers grains are predominately sold in the domestic market. Specifically, we ship a substantial portion of the ethanol we produce to the New York harbor. We expect our ethanol and distillers grains marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets, and believe that there is potential for increased international sales of our products. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a large portion of our products to be marketed and sold domestically. In addition, export demand is typically more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations.
Canada, India and South Korea were top destinations for ethanol exports during the past year. Exports of ethanol were lower for 2021 but have increased significantly in 2022. However, tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States have reduced export demand from those countries. Tariffs imposed by China remained unchanged during the past year. In March 2022, Brazil suspended its tariff through the end of the year on ethanol imported from the United States following a 10% reduction on the tariff in November 2021. However despite this suspension, Brazil has not become a leading player in the export market in recent months. Trade barriers with key markets may continue to take a toll on ethanol export demand which could negatively affect domestic ethanol prices. 
Exports of distillers grains increased in 2021 with the United States exporting about a third of distillers grain produced. The export market has remained strong in 2022 with Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam continuing as top destinations for distillers grains exports. Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past five years effectively closed the Chinese market. 
    As described below in "Distribution Methods," we sell carbon dioxide to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products") and we market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers in the domestic market. 
Distribution Methods
Our ethanol plant is located near Union City, Indiana in Randolph County. We selected the site because of its proximity to existing ethanol consumption and accessibility to road and rail transportation. Our site is in close proximity to rail and major highways that connect to major population centers such as Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, New York and Chicago. 
Ethanol 
    We entered into an Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, LLC ("Murex") for the purpose of marketing and distributing all of the ethanol we produce at the plant. Under the terms of the agreement, Murex markets all of our ethanol unless we choose to sell a portion at a retail fueling station owned by us or one of our affiliates. Murex pays to us the purchase price invoiced to the third-party purchaser less all resale costs, taxes paid by Murex and Murex's commission which is calculated on each net gallon of ethanol taken under the agreement. Murex has agreed to purchase on its own account and at 
market price any ethanol which it is unable to sell to a third party purchaser. Murex has promised to use its best efforts to obtain the best purchase price available for our ethanol. In addition, Murex has agreed to promptly notify us of any and all price arbitrage opportunities. Under the agreement, Murex is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our ethanol. Murex handles all RIN activity, submits regulatory reports, and leases us a minimum number of tank cars for rail transportation and manages the tank car fleet in exchange for a monthly payment. 
On September 14, 2022, we executed an amendment to extend the term until December 31, 2024, subject to automatic renewals thereafter for one-year periods unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term. The agreement may also be terminated due to the insolvency or intentional misconduct of either party or upon the default of one of the parties as set forth in the agreement. In addition, the amendment added a provision that allows Cardinal to terminate the agreement on 90 days prior written notice if we experience a "Material Change in Control". However, upon termination of the agreement for any reason, we may be obligated to continue to deliver ethanol to Murex for a period of time to cover certain contractual commitments for which we gave prior written approval. The amendment also provides for certain adjustments to the purchase price for sales made to Murex for its own account or for sales of exported ethanol. If this adjusted price can not be finalized at time of payment, the parties may agree upon a provisional price which shall be trued up later. The amendment will be effective on December 1, 2022. 
Distillers Grains 
    We have entered into an agreement with CHS, Inc. to market all distillers grains we produce at the plant. CHS, Inc. is a diversified energy, grains and foods company owned by farmers, ranchers and cooperatives. CHS, Inc. provides products and services ranging from grain marketing to food processing to meet the needs of its customers around the world. We receive a percentage of the selling price actually received by CHS, Inc. in marketing our distillers grains to its customers. The agreement remains in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS, Inc. is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our distillers grains. 
Corn Oil
    We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers. Our corn oil is mainly used as an animal feed ingredient and as a feedstock in biodiesel production.
Carbon Dioxide 
    Air Products purchases a portion of the carbon dioxide gas produced at our plant. We entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement with Air Products under which Air Products was obligated to purchase a minimum of 98,700 tons of carbon dioxide gas. In addition, we executed a Site Lease Agreement with Air Products under which Air Products leased a portion of our property, on which it is operating a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant. On November 26, 2019, we sent written notice of termination of the Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement and Site Lease Agreement which was to be effective on June 1, 2020. However, due to disruptions related to COVID-19, the Company and Air Products agreed to rescind the terminations and extend the agreements one year to June 1, 2021. Effective June 1, 2021, we amended the agreement with Air Products. The amendment extended the initial term of the agreement to May 31, 2026 with automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party by providing at least six months written notice prior to the expiration of the term. The amendment increased the price paid for carbon dioxide subject to a price adjustment in the event of a take or pay shortfall. The amendment also provided that we may do anything we wish with excess carbon dioxide gas produced provided that if the excess is sold to competitors of Air Products then Air Products' annual take or pay obligation will be reduced accordingly and Air Products has the option to terminate the Agreement upon 90 days written notice. In addition, the amendment provides that, after the three year anniversary, we may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event as defined in the amendment or if we decide to sequester our carbon dioxide. 
Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports 
The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increased incrementally each year until the United States reached the requirement to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS 
must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"). The statutory volumes and the EPA's volumes for 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in billion gallons) are as follows: 

 | | Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2020 | Statutory | 30.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 12/2019 | 20.09 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 7/2022 | 17.13 | 12.50 
2021 | Statutory | 33.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 7/2022 | 18.84 | 13.79 
2022 | Statutory | 36.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Rule 7/2022 | 20.63 (+0.25) | 15.00 


In July 2022, the EPA retroactively reduced the RVO for total renewable fuel for 2020 to 17.13 billion gallons. The portion that could be met by corn-based ethanol was reduced to 12.50 billion for 2020. The EPA indicated that the reason for this retroactive proposed change was due to program and market challenges, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the EPA set the RVO for total renewable fuel for 2021 at 18.84 billion gallons and for 2022 to 20.63 billion gallons. The portion that could be met by corn-based ethanol was 13.79 billion for 2021 and 15 billion gallons for 2022. The EPA also added a 250 million gallon supplemental obligation in 2022 and stated its intention to do the same for 2023. The EPA has not yet released the proposed rules to set the renewable volume obligation for 2023. 
    Small refineries can petition the EPA annually for an exemption from their ethanol use requirements for the prior compliance year. The EPA granted significantly more small refinery waivers in 2018 and 2019 than in past years and did not reallocate the waived gallons to other refiners. These actions resulted in decreased ethanol demand which led to reduced market ethanol prices and negative operating margins in the ethanol industry. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision finding that a small refinery may obtain a hardship exemption even if its earlier exemption had lapsed in one or more previous years. In June 2022, the EPA announced the denial of 69 small refinery exemption petitions for one or more compliance years between 2016 and 2021 on the grounds that the petitioners had failed to show that the EPA had a basis to approve them. 
In February 2010, the EPA issued new regulations governing the RFS. These new regulations have been called RFS2. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in green house gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% green house gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in green house gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in green house gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. However, RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes meets the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS up to 115,000,000 gallons annually due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle green house gas requirement. Therefore, we are not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle green house gas reductions for a significant amount of our production. Certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. 
Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. In 2021, gasoline demand in the United States was approximately 135 billion gallons which was a significant increase over consumption in 2020. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol in 2021 was 13.5 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the “blending wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends. Gasoline demand is estimated to rise in 2022 but remain shy of pre-COVID-19 levels due in part to higher gasoline prices.
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. Previously, different gasoline blendstocks were required at certain times of the year due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which prevented E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. In May 2019, the EPA issued a final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15. However in June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down this rule finding that the EPA exceeded its authority. In May 2022, the EPA issued an emergency waiver to allow sales of E15 during the summer months. The reason given for the temporary suspension of the prohibition on year-round sales was that it was an effort to counteract rising gasoline prices. It appears that the EPA is considering enacting a rule to allow year-round sales before next summer. However, it is unclear whether that will occur.
    A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. 
In May 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") announced the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program which consists of up to $100 million in funding for grants to be used to increase the availability of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. Funds may be awarded to retailers such as fueling stations and convenience stores to assist in the cost of installation or upgrading of fuel pumps and other infrastructure. To date, the USDA has awarded approximately $74 million to eligible projects. 
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which has several provisions that may benefit the ethanol industry, was signed into law. There is, however, considerable uncertainty as to how the newly required provisions will be implemented in future regulatory guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act maintains the 12-year credit period for the existing Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage ("CCS"). However, the Act extends eligibility for the credit to facilities that have commenced construction by December 31, 2032, and substantially lowers the minimum annual capture requirements to 12,500 tons for qualifying facilities. In addition, the potential credit rate is increased five times for industrial facilities and power plants that capture their carbon emissions to $85 per metric ton of carbon oxide stored in secure geologic formations, $60 per ton for the beneficial utilization of captured carbon emissions, and $60 per ton for carbon oxide stored in oil and gas fields. Prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements must be met by the facility to claim the full amount of the higher credit. In addition, projects will now be eligible to be directly paid for the credit by the Internal Revenue Service for the first five years with no direct pay for many projects for the final seven years of the credit, and, as an alternative to direct pay, projects will now be allowed to sell their credits to unrelated third parties for cash without adverse tax consequences. The Act also creates a Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for the production of low-emissions transportation fuel produced and sold in 2025, 2026 and 2027, subject to certain requirements as to prevailing wage and apprenticeship. However, the Act provides that the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit is not available for a facility that qualifies for the Section 45Q tax credit. Additional incentives for production of sustainable aviation fuel and $500 million in funding for biofuels infrastructure funding are also included in the Act. 
Effect of Governmental Regulation
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the 
plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions affecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
    In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.    
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $138,000 complying with environmental laws. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. 
We are subject to regulation by many governmental agencies, both federal and state. The chart below refers to some of the most important agencies and the areas of regulation.

Agency | Area of Regulation 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | Environmental Discharge and Renewable Volume Obligations
Indiana Department of Environmental Management | Air Permit and Environmental Discharge 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau | Regulation of Alcohol Fuel and Distilled Spirits Permit 
Federal Railroad Administration | Shipments Via Rail of Hazardous Material 
U.S. Department of Agriculture | Food Safety Modernization Act 
Indiana Department of Agriculture | Grain Procurement 
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration | Workplace Safety 
U.S. Department of Labor | Wage and Hour 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement | Employment Eligibilty of Alien Workers 
U.S. Securities Exchange Commission | Public Reporting of Financial Related Information 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service | Tax Policy 
Commodities Futures Trading Commission | Dodd-Frank and Commodities Trading 

If any of these agencies find us in violation of any regulation, we could incur significant penalties and other economic disadvantages, including loss of permission to operate. 
Competition
Ethanol
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, several of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. The ethanol industry was impacted by the pandemic in fiscal year 2020, which resulted in decreased demand. The ethanol industry rebounded in 2021. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are approximately 204 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 17.5 billion gallons of ethanol. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
Following the acquisition of several plants by POET Biorefining from Flint Hills Resources in 2021, the largest ethanol producers now include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. 
The following table identifies the majority of the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.
U.S. FUEL ETHANOL PRODUCTION CAPACITY

POET Biorefining | 2,811 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,747 
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,613

The ethanol industry in the United States experienced increased competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States during 2012 which was likely the result of the expiration of the tariff on imported ethanol which expired on December 31, 2011. Although ethanol imports have since decreased, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again that could negatively impact demand for ethanol produced in the United States which could result in lower operating margins. 
Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so. 
 A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been an increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grains 
Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Ethanol plants produced approximately 35.4 million metric tons of distillers grains in 2021. 
The primary consumers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine and poultry markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of 
poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from it. The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: soybean meal, corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Soybean meal, dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
    The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. To produce 135 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 47 million bushels of corn per year, or approximately 129,000 bushels per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. Traditionally, corn grown in the area of the plant site has been fed locally to livestock or exported for feeding or processing and/or overseas export sales. 
    The price at which we purchase corn will depend on prevailing market prices. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors affecting grain commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs and foreign purchases. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to grain prices, ethanol producers are generally not able to compensate for increases in the cost of grain feedstock through adjustments in prices charged for their ethanol. We therefore anticipate that our plant's profitability will be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. 
    In an attempt to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on operating profits, we take hedging positions in corn futures markets. Hedging means protecting the price at which we buy corn and the price at which we will sell our products in the future. It is a way to attempt to reduce the risk caused by price fluctuation. The effectiveness of hedging activities is dependent upon, among other things, the cost of corn and our ability to sell sufficient amounts of ethanol and distillers grains to utilize all of the corn subject to the futures contracts. Hedging activities can result in costs to us because price movements in grain contracts are highly volatile and are influenced by many factors beyond our control. These costs may be significant. 
    High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. Corn prices were higher during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a smaller crop carryout in some areas from the 2021 harvest and concerns regarding predictions of the corn crop for fall of 2022. In addition, global economic uncertainty, rising inflation, market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices contributed to higher corn prices. On October 12, 2022, the USDA released a report estimating the 2022 corn crop in the United States at approximately 13.9 billion bushels, down 8% from last year's production, with yields averaging 171.9 bushels per acre. The USDA forecasted area harvested for grain at 80.8 million acres, down 5% from 2021. The Indiana corn crop is estimated to be approximately 944 million bushels, down approximately 8% from 2021. Yields in Indiana are expected to be approximately 187 bushels per acre, down approximately 4% from 2021. Management will continue to monitor the availability of corn in our area. 
Utilities
We engaged Capstone Energy Services, LLC ("Capstone") to provide us with on-going energy management services. Capstone manages the procurement and delivery of energy to our location. They assist with strategy development, cost analysis, risk management, supply management and reporting services in exchange for a monthly fee. The agreement commenced on June 1, 2015, and continues for one year unless earlier terminated due to an event of default. Following the expiration of the initial one-year term, the agreement will be on a month-to-month basis and may be terminated by either party upon sixty days prior written notice. 
Natural Gas
Natural gas is also an important input commodity to our manufacturing process. Our natural gas usage for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was 0.9% more MMBTUs than for last fiscal year, constituting 3.9% of our total costs of goods sold. We are using natural gas to produce process steam and to dry our distillers grain products to a moisture content at which they can be stored for long periods of time, and can be transported greater distances, so that we can market the product to broader livestock markets, including poultry and swine markets in the continental United States. 
On March 20, 2007, we entered into a Long-Term Transportation Service Contract for Redelivery of Natural Gas with Ohio Valley Gas Corporation ("Ohio Valley"). Under the contract, Ohio Valley receives, transports and redelivers natural gas to us for all of our natural gas requirements up to a maximum of 100,000 therms per purchase gas day and our estimated annual 
natural gas requirements of 34,000,000 therms. For all gas delivered to us by Ohio Valley, we pay a throughput rate in the amount of $0.0138 per therm for the first five years of the contract term, and $0.0138 increased by the compounded inflation rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. In addition, we pay a service charge for all gas delivered to us by Ohio Valley in the amount of $750 per delivery meter per billing cycle per month for the first five years of the contract term and $750 increased by the compounded inflation rate over the initial rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. The initial term of the contract was ten years. Provided neither party terminates the contract, the contract will automatically renew for a series of not more than three consecutive one year periods.
Electricity
We require a significant amount of electrical power to operate the plant. On May 2, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Indiana Michigan Power Company to furnish our electric energy. The initial term of the contract was 30 months from the time service is commenced and continues thereafter unless terminated by either party with 12 months written notice. We pay Indiana Michigan Power Company monthly pursuant to their standard rates. 
Water
    We require a significant supply of water. Engineering specifications show our plant's water requirements to be approximately 774 gallons per minute, 1.1 million gallons per day, depending on the quality of water. We have assessed our water needs and available supply and have determined that we have an adequate supply. Union City Water Works is supplying the water necessary to operate our plant. 
         Recycling water back into the process minimizes discharge water. This will have the long-term effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. Our plant design incorporates the ICM/Phoenix Bio-Methanator wastewater treatment process resulting in a zero discharge of plant process water. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
    We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. In addition, we were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain corn oil technologies necessary to extract corn oil during our plant operations. 
Seasonality of Ethanol Sales
    We experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
    As discussed above, we have entered into a marketing agreement with Murex for the purpose of marketing and distributing our ethanol and have engaged CHS, Inc. for the purpose of marketing and distributing our distillers grains. We rely on Murex for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and CHS, Inc. for the sale and distribution of our distillers grains. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on Murex and CHS, Inc. for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of Murex or CHS, Inc. as our marketing agent for our ethanol and distillers grains, respectively, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues.
Trading Division 
    We procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our Trading Division, which began operations at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. 
Principal Products

    We have and expect to continue to buy primarily soybeans and corn from producers relying principally on forward purchase contracts to ensure an adequate supply of grain. However, we occasionally also purchase grain the day of delivery. Grain prices are typically comprised of futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") and local basis adjustments. 
Grain Markets and Distribution Methods
    Grain shipments are made by rail and truck. Our sales are made to grain processors and export markets in the southeastern United States. Our grain sales are generally made by contract for delivery in a future period. Income is expected to be earned on grain bought and sold, the appreciation or depreciation in the basis value of the grain held and the appreciation or depreciation between the futures contract months.
Competition
    We primarily compete in the purchase of grain on a local or regional basis although there are some larger national and international companies that maintain regional grain purchase and storage facilities. We compete in the sale of grain with other public and private grain brokers, elevator operators and farmer owned cooperatives. Competition is based primarily on price, service and reliability. 
Seasonality of Grain Purchases and Sales
    Our grain operations are somewhat seasonal in nature in that the grain we procure is harvested in October and November. The largest portion of the grain is delivered by producers in the fall although we buy and sell a significant portion of our grain throughout the year. 
Risk Management
    We manage the futures price risk of changing commodity prices by entering into exchange-traded futures contracts on the CME. The CME is a regulated commodity futures exchange that maintains futures markets for the grain we trade. Futures prices are determined by worldwide supply and demand. 
    We entered into a Risk Management Agreement with John Stewart & Associates ("JS&A") under which JS&A provides risk management and related services pertaining to grain hedging, grain pricing information, aid in purchase of grain, and assistance in risk management as it pertains to ethanol, co-products and soybeans. In exchange for JS&A's risk management services, we pay JS&A a fee of $1,500 per month. We are currently on a month to month basis for this contract with JS&A. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time upon written notice. 
We also entered into an agreement with Advance Trading to assist us with hedging corn, ethanol, natural gas and soybeans. We pay them a fee of $3,000 per month for these services. The term of the agreement is month-to-month and may be terminated by either party at any time upon proper notice. 
We also entered into an agreement with Commodity & Ingredient Hedging, LLC to evaluate and provide marketing advice and margin management related to cash sales and purchases, forward contracts and exchange-traded futures and options. We pay an annual fee of $12,000 in exchange for these services. The agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal as provided in the agreement.
Employees

    We have 66 full-time employees as of December 1, 2022. We employ individuals in the local region around our one facility. Many of our employees require some technical or professional background and we compete for them via wages and benefits. We attract them from schools and colleges within our region, which are numerous. There are several other ethanol plants within a fifty mile radius of our facility. Individuals with ethanol specific skills are available to us because of this proximity. However, this competition for resources also presents a challenge in retaining those with specialized skills.
Working Capital
    We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the Ethanol Division and for purchases of grain commodities for the Trading Division. Our primary sources of working capital is cash we generate from our operations along with our Declining Loan and our Revolving Credit Loan with our primary lender First National Bank of Omaha. The Declining Loan provides $36,000,000 in total for us to use on capital projects allowing us to preserve our working capital at a sufficient level. We have engaged ICM, Inc. to install a system to produce high protein feed which is currently expected to cost approximately $50,000,000 including recent change orders, and be funded from operations and borrowings from the Declining Loan. We have also engaged with an unrelated third party to pursue the CCS Project. However, the CCS Project is subject to many variables that could have a material effect on its feasibility and our ability to construct and complete the CCS Project. 
At September 30, 2022, we have approximately $20,000,000 available to draw on the Revolving Credit Loan to provide working capital. We will discuss the Declining Loan and Revolving Credit Loan in more detail in "Item 7- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
