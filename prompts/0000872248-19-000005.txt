Item 1 and 2. | Business and Properties

Overview
PetroQuest Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the State of Delaware with primary operations in Texas and Louisiana. We seek to grow our production, proved reserves, cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration, development and acquisition activities. From the commencement of our operations through 2002, we were focused exclusively in the Gulf Coast Basin with onshore properties principally in southern Louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico shelf. During 2003, we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties with our acquisition of the Carthage Field in East Texas. From 2005 through 2015, we further implemented this strategy by focusing our efforts in the Woodford Shale play in Oklahoma. In response to lower commodity prices and to strengthen our balance sheet, we sold all of our Oklahoma assets in three transactions during 2015 and 2016. In December 2017, we acquired approximately 24,600 gross acres in central Louisiana targeting the Austin Chalk to provide greater exposure to oil production and reserves. During January 2018, we sold all of our Gulf of Mexico assets to further reduce our liabilities and strengthen our liquidity position.
Our liquidity position has been negatively impacted by lower commodity prices beginning in 2014. In response to the lower commodity prices, we executed numerous actions beginning in 2015 aimed at increasing liquidity, reducing overall debt levels and other liabilities, and extending debt maturities. Despite these actions, our overall liquidity position and our cash available for capital expenditures continued to be negatively impacted by weak natural gas prices, declining production and increased cash interest expense on outstanding indebtedness.
As a result of the forgoing, we engaged in discussions and negotiations with the lenders under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), certain holders of the 2021 Notes (as defined below) and the 2021 PIK Notes (as defined below), and their legal and financial advisors regarding various alternatives with respect to our capital structure and financial position, including our significant amount of indebtedness and the August 15, 2018 interest payments overdue on our 2021 PIK Notes and 2021 Notes.
Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
As a result of the forgoing discussions and negotiations, on November 6, 2018 (the “Petition Date”), we and our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (collectively, the “Petition,” and the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”).
In connection with the Chapter 11 filing, on the Petition Date, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) holders of 81.83% of our 10% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), (ii) holders of 84.76% of our 10% Second Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2021 (the “2021 PIK Notes”) and (iii) each of the lenders, or investment advisors or managers for the account of each of the lenders under our multidraw term loan agreement (the "Multidraw Term Loan Agreement"), pursuant to which such parties agreed to support the Plan (as defined below).
On January 31, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Debtors’ First Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, as Immaterially Modified as of January 28, 2019 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Plan”) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 8, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. On the Effective Date, TDC Energy, LLC, Pittrans, Inc. and Sea Harvester Energy Development, L.L.C. were dissolved. The remaining Debtors (collectively, the "Reorganized Debtors") continue in existence. In this Form 10-K, we may refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date as the “Predecessor,” and on and after the Effective Date as the “Successor.”
On the Effective Date and pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the Confirmation Order, the Company:

• | Adopted an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;


• | Appointed four new members to the Successor’s board of directors to replace all of the directors of the Predecessor, other than the director also serving as Chief Executive Officer, who was re-appointed pursuant to the Plan;


• | Canceled all of the Predecessor’s common stock and 6.875% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock with the former holders thereof not receiving any consideration in respect of such stock;

#6#


• | Issued to the former holders of the Predecessor’s 2021 Notes and 2021 PIK Notes (collectively the “Old Notes”), in exchange for the cancellation and discharge of the Old Notes:


◦ | 8,900,000 shares of the Successor’s Class A Common Stock; and


◦ | $80.0 million of the Successor’s 10% Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2024 (the “2024 PIK Notes”);


• | Issued 300,000 shares of the Successor’s Class A Common Stock to certain former holders of the Old Notes for their commitment to backstop the Exit Facility (as defined below);


• | Issued to the Class B Holder (as defined in the Successor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation) one share of the Successor’s Class B Common Stock, which confers certain rights to elect directors and certain drag-along rights;


• | Issued to the Class C Holder (as defined in the Successor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation) one share of the Successor’s Class C Common Stock, which confers certain rights to elect directors and certain drag-along rights;


• | Entered into a new $50 million senior secured Term Loan Agreement (the “Exit Facility”) upon the repayment and termination of the Predecessor’s Multidraw Term Loan Agreement;


• | Entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain holders of the Successor’s Class A Common Stock and 2024 PIK Notes; and


• | Adopted a new management incentive plan (the “2019 Long Term Incentive Plan”) for officers, directors and employees of the Successor and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which 1,344,000 shares of the Successor’s Class A Common Stock were reserved for issuance.

The foregoing is a summary of the substantive provisions of the Plan and related transactions and is not intended to be a complete description of, or a substitute for a full and complete reading of the Plan and the other documents referred to above. See “Note 2- Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our bankruptcy and resulting reorganization.
Business Strategy
Focus Capital Toward More Predictable Onshore Assets. As a result of the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets in January 2018, our asset base is now exclusively comprised of onshore assets in Texas and Louisiana. We plan to continue to focus the majority of our capital spending developing our lower-risk Cotton Valley acreage in East Texas where we believe the less complex geology, combined with the large inventory of offsetting vertical and horizontal well data, offers greater predictability in increasing production and proved reserves. With respect to horizontal drilling operations in the Carthage Field, we have a 100% five year drilling success rate on 21 gross wells drilled. Additionally, our East Texas acreage position provides a significant inventory of future drilling locations, which we expect to develop over a long-term drilling campaign. We also expect to drill our initial well in our Austin Chalk acreage in 2019, where we have substantial geologic and reservoir data from a multitude of vertical and horizontal wells in the area. We plan to apply our latest drilling and completion techniques to consistently improve the economic development of our resource potential.
Maintain Our Financial Flexibility. We strive to consistently fund our capital expenditures with a combination of cash flow from operations, cash on hand, asset sales and certain joint venture arrangements rather than increasing our total debt. Because we operate approximately 82% of our total estimated proved reserves and manage the drilling and completion activities on an additional 18% of such reserves, we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments in order to better align our sources and uses of capital.
Pursue Balanced Growth and Portfolio Mix. We plan to pursue a risk-balanced approach to the growth and stability of our reserves, production, cash flows and earnings. Our goal is to weight our capital allocation to lower risk development activities and reduce the capital allocated to higher risk exploration activities. At December 31, 2018, approximately 94% of our estimated proved reserves were located in longer life and lower risk basins in East Texas and 6% were located in the shorter life, but higher flow rate reservoirs in the Gulf Coast Basin. In terms of production diversification, during 2018, 55% of our production was derived from longer life basins. Our 2018 production was comprised of 75% natural gas, 9% oil and 16% natural gas liquids. We believe that the development of our Austin Chalk acreage in central Louisiana will allow us to achieve a more balanced commodity profile as these assets are believed to have a greater percentage of oil production than our East Texas assets.
Concentrate in Core Operating Areas and Build Scale. With the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets, we have substantially reduced our operational footprint allowing us to concentrate our efforts in fewer areas. We plan to focus on our operations in East 
#7#

Texas and our Austin Chalk acreage. We also expect to continue to harvest cash flow from our Gulf Coast producing assets as they are expected to require minimal capital expenditures. Operating in concentrated areas helps to better control our overhead by enabling us to manage a greater amount of acreage with fewer employees and minimize incremental costs of increased drilling and production. We have substantial geological and reservoir data and partner relationships in these regions. We believe that these factors, combined with the existing infrastructure and favorable geologic conditions with multiple known oil and gas producing reservoirs in these regions, will provide us with attractive investment opportunities.
2018 Financial and Operational Summary
As a result of our Chapter 11 reorganization activities described above, our capital spending and operating activity was significantly reduced in 2018. During 2018, we invested $16.1 million primarily related to two completions in our East Texas drilling program, various plugging and abandonment projects and leasing efforts in the Austin Chalk. These activities were financed through cash on hand and our cash flow from operations. During 2018, our production decreased 23% to 21.3 Bcfe due primarily to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets in January 2018. Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 decreased 16% from 2017 as discussed in greater detail below.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The following table sets forth certain information about our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018:

 | Oil (MBbls) | NGL (Mmcfe) | | Natural Gas (Mmcf) | Total Mmcfe*
Proved Developed | 567 | | 10,220 | | 47,516 | 61,143 
Proved Undeveloped | 619 | | 6,802 | | 58,648 | 69,162 
Total Proved | 1,186 | | 17,022 | | 106,164 | 130,305


* | Oil conversion to Mcfe at one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids to six Mcf of natural gas.

Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 decreased 16% from 2017 totaling 1.2 MMBbls of oil, 17.0 Bcfe of natural gas liquids (Ngls) and 106.2 Bcf of natural gas. At December 31, 2018, our standardized measure of our discounted cash flows, which includes the estimated impact of future income taxes, totaled $124.0 million. We had a pre-tax present value, discounted at 10%, of the estimated future net revenues based on 12-month, first day of month, average prices during 2018 (“PV-10”) of $124.0 million. See the reconciliation of standardized measure of discounted cash flows to PV-10 below. The decrease in reserves was primarily the result of the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets in January 2018 resulting in a reduction of 10.1 Bcfe. 
Our standardized measure of discounted cash flows and PV-10 utilized prices (adjusted for field differentials) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as follows:
 
 | 12/31/2018 | 12/31/2017
Oil per Bbl | $68.71 | $52.46 
Natural gas per Mcf | $3.13 | $3.03 
Ngl per Mcfe | $4.08 | $3.23 

 Ryder Scott Company, L.P., a nationally recognized independent petroleum engineering firm, prepared the estimates of our proved reserves and future net cash flows (and present value thereof) attributable to such proved reserves at December 31, 2018. Our internal reservoir engineering staff is managed by an individual with over 36 years of industry experience as a reservoir and production engineer, including sixteen years as the Reservoir Engineering Manager for PetroQuest.
Our internal controls that are used in our reserve estimation process are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our reserve estimates are computed and reported in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These internal controls are regularly tested in connection with our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and include:
•Utilizing documented process workflows;
•Employing qualified professional engineering, geological, land, financial and marketing personnel; and
•Providing continuing education and training for all personnel involved in our reserve estimation process.
#8#

Each quarter, our Reservoir Engineering Manager presents the status of the changes to our reserve estimates to our executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer. These reserve estimates are then presented to our Board of Directors in connection with quarterly meetings. In addition, our reserve booking policies and procedures are reviewed annually by members of our Board of Directors with oil and gas technical experience.
With respect to proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD reserves”), we maintain a five year development plan that is updated and approved annually by our PUD Review Committee (as described below) with input from our executive team and asset managers and reviewed quarterly by our executive team and asset managers. Our development plan includes only PUDs that we are reasonably certain will be drilled and completed within five years of booking based upon qualitative and quantitative factors including estimated risk-based returns, current pricing forecasts, recent drilling results, availability of services, equipment and personnel, seasonal weather patterns and changes in drilling and completion techniques and technology. Our PUD reserves are based upon our substantial basin-specific technical and operating experience relative to the location of the reserves. Over the last five years, we have realized a 100% drilling success rate on 21 gross wells drilled in East Texas where 100% of our PUD reserves are currently booked. Furthermore, because all of our PUD reserves are direct offsetting locations to producing wells, we have comprehensive data available, which enables us to forecast economic results, including drilling and operating costs, with reasonable certainty. 
Our PUD Review Committee (the “Committee”) is comprised of our Executive Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial Officer and Reservoir Engineering Manager and meets annually in connection with each year-end reserve report. The Committee is responsible for reviewing all PUD locations, not only in terms of technical and financial merits as reviewed by our independent petroleum engineering firm, but also to apply a robust evaluation of the timing and reasonable certainty of the development plan in light of all known circumstances including our budget, the outlook for commodity prices and the location of ongoing drilling programs. The Committee’s evaluation of reasonable certainty of the development plan includes a thorough assessment of near term drilling plans to develop PUDs, a review of adherence to previously adopted development plans and a review of historical PUD conversion rates. 
As of December 31, 2018, our PUD reserves totaled 69.2 Bcfe, a 13% decrease from our PUD reserves at December 31, 2017. During 2018, we spent $4.2 million converting 6.5 Bcfe of PUD reserves at December 31, 2017 to proved developed reserves at December 31, 2018. In addition at year-end 2018, drilling was in progress on three PUD locations which resulted in the conversion of 13.6 Bcfe to proved developed reserves in early 2019.    
The following table presents an analysis of the change in our PUD reserves from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018:

 | MMcfe 
PUD reserve balance at December 31, 2017 | 79,506 | 
Conversions to proved developed | (6,514 | )
Net additions from extensions, discoveries and revisions | 3,494 | 
Divestitures | (7,324 | )
PUD reserve balance at December 31, 2018 | 69,162 | 

During 2018, we added 11.1 Bcfe of PUD reserves as a result of third party drilling, as well as leasing efforts which provided two additional PUD locations. All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2018 were associated with the future development of our East Texas properties. We expect all of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2018 to be developed over the next five years. However, our PUD reserve inventory does not encompass all drilling activities over the next five years. We expect to continue to allocate capital to projects that do not have proved reserves ascribed to them. At December 31, 2018, we had no PUD reserves booked for longer than five years. Estimated future costs related to the development of PUD reserves are expected to total $24.7 million in 2019, $6.0 million in 2020, $0.2 million in 2021, $27.3 million in 2022 and $11.9 million in 2023. During 2019, we expect to convert approximately 26.7 Bcfe of PUDs at December 31, 2018 to proved developed reserves, including 13.6 Bcfe of PUD reserves that have already been converted to proved developed in early 2019.

The estimated cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were as follows:

 | Proved Developed(M$) | | ProvedUndeveloped(M$) | Total Proved(M$)
Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows (1) | $ | 131,909 | | $ | 105,601 | $ | 237,510
Discounted pre-tax future net cash flows (PV-10) (1) | $ | 87,543 | | $ | 36,482 | $ | 124,025
Total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | | | | $ | 124,025


(1) | Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows and discounted pre-tax future net cash flows (PV-10) are non-GAAP measures because they exclude income tax effects. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors as they are based on prices, costs and discount factors that are consistent from company to company, while the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. As a result, the Company believes that investors can use these non-GAAP measures as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of the Company’s reserves to other companies. The Company also understands that securities analysts and rating agencies use these non-GAAP measures in similar ways.

The following table reconciles undiscounted and discounted pre-tax future net cash flows to standardized measure of discounted cash flows as of December 31, 2018:

 | Total Proved (M$)
Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows | $ | 237,510
10% annual discount | 113,485 | 
Discounted pre-tax future net cash flows | 124,025 | 
Future income taxes discounted at 10% | — | 
Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 124,025

We have not filed any reports with other federal agencies that contain an estimate of total proved net oil and gas reserves.
Core Areas
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves and annual production from each of our core areas (in Bcfe) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 | 2018 | 2017 
 | Reserves | Production | | Reserves | Production
Gulf Coast | 8.3 | | 9.1 | | 13.8 | 10.6
Gulf of Mexico (1) | — | | 0.4 | | 10.5 | 6.9 
East Texas | 122.0 | | 11.8 | | 131.6 | 10.1
 | 130.3 | | 21.3 | | 155.9 | 27.6

(1) In January 2018, we sold all of our producing Gulf of Mexico assets.
East Texas
During 2018, we invested $8.2 million in our East Texas properties where we completed two gross wells, achieving a 100% success rate. Production from our East Texas assets averaged 32.3 MMcfe per day during 2018, a 16% increase from 2017 average daily production; however, our estimated proved reserves decreased 7% from 2017 primarily due to 7.3 Bcfe of reserves sold during 2018.
Gulf Coast 
During 2018, we invested $7.6 million in this core area, including additional acquisitions of Austin Chalk acreage in central Louisiana. Production from this area decreased 14% from 2017 totaling 24.9 MMcfe per day in 2018 due to normal production declines. Our estimated proved reserves in this area at year end 2018 decreased 40% from 2017 primarily as a result of the 9.1 Bcfe of production in 2018.
#10#

Gulf of Mexico
We sold our assets in this core area in January 2018. See Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.
Markets and Customers
We sell our oil and natural gas production under fixed or floating market contracts. Customers purchase all of our oil and natural gas production at current market prices. The terms of the arrangements generally require customers to pay us within 30 days after the production month ends. As a result, if the customers were to default on their payment obligations to us, near-term earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. However, due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of these customers or any other single customer would adversely affect our ability to market production. Our ability to market oil and natural gas from our wells depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including:

• | the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;


• | the proximity of the natural gas production to pipelines;


• | the availability of capacity in such pipelines;


• | the demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;


• | the availability of alternative fuel sources;


• | the effects of inclement weather;


• | state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production; and


• | federal regulation of gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to market all of the oil or natural gas we produce or that favorable prices can be obtained for the oil and natural gas we produce.
A portion of the natural gas production that we operate in East Texas is committed to a minimum volumetric delivery contract with a third party pipeline company. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to deliver 11.0 Bcf of natural gas in each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Based upon our projected drilling plans, current estimated proved developed reserves and production, we expect that this commitment will be met.
In view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices and demand or the overall effect such prices and demand will have on the Company. During 2018, one customer accounted for 26%, one accounted for 21%, one accounted for 16% and one accounted for 12% of our oil and natural gas revenue. During 2017, one customer accounted for 29% and one accounted for 24% of our oil and natural gas revenue. During 2016, one customer accounted for 23%, one accounted for 17%, one accounted for 14% and one accounted for 10% of our oil and natural gas revenue. These percentages do not consider the effects of commodity hedges. We do not believe that the loss of any of our oil or natural gas purchasers would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability of other purchasers.

Production, Pricing and Production Cost Data
The following table sets forth our production, pricing and production cost data during the periods indicated. Our core area of East Texas represented approximately 94% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018. The Gulf Coast area represented less than 10% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018, but represented 25% or more of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Leasehold Acreage
The following table shows our approximate developed and undeveloped (gross and net) leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2018:

 | Leasehold Acreage
 | Developed | Undeveloped
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net 
Louisiana | 4,050 | | 1,260 | | 24,994 | 19,776
East Texas | 42,843 | | 21,746 | | 11,310 | 6,725 
Federal Waters | 5,760 | | 163 | | 5,760 | 5,760 
Total | 52,653 | | 23,169 | | 42,064 | 32,261

Leases covering 1.5% of our net undeveloped acreage are scheduled to expire in 2019, 52% in 2020, 11% in 2021 and 35% thereafter. At December 31, 2018, we do not have any PUD reserves attributed to acreage that has a lease expiration date preceding the scheduled date for initial development. Of the minimal acreage subject to leases scheduled to expire during 2019, 100% relates to undeveloped acreage in East Texas.

Title to Properties
Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business.
As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review of local records, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Our properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and gas leases;


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;


• | a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments;


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements; pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are conventional in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.
Federal Regulations
Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Historically, the transportation and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated the price for all “first sales” of natural gas. Thus, all of our sales of gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERC's more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Our natural gas sales are generally made at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Therefore, even though we sell significant volumes to major purchasers, we believe that other purchasers would be willing to buy our natural gas at comparable market prices.
On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 EPA”) was signed into law. This comprehensive act contains many provisions that are intended to encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the U.S. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, BOEM and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. The 2005 EPA amends the NGA to make it unlawful for “any entity”, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC's enforcement authority.
#15#

In 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, beginning in 2009, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. The monitoring and reporting required by these rules have increased our administrative costs. To date, we do not believe we have been, nor do we anticipate that we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. The spot markets for oil, gas and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") are subject to volatility and supply and demand factors fluctuations. Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated, and are subject to applicable contract provisions made at market prices and typically under short term agreements with third parties. Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a portion of our oil, gas or natural gas liquids production. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to the FERC's jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes.
The regulation of pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids is generally more light-handed than the FERC's regulation of gas pipelines under the NGA. Regulated pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are subject to common carrier obligations that generally ensure non-discriminatory access. With respect to interstate pipeline transportation subject to regulation of the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, rates generally must be cost-based, although market-based rates or negotiated settlement rates are permitted in certain circumstances. Pursuant to FERC Order No. 561, pipeline rates are subject to an indexing methodology. Under this indexing methodology, pipeline rates are subject to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, minus one percent. A pipeline can seek to increase its rates above index levels provided that the pipeline can establish that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index. A pipeline can seek to charge market based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power. In addition, a pipeline can establish rates pursuant to settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. A pipeline can seek to establish initial rates for new services through a cost-of-service proceeding, a market-based rate proceeding, or through an agreement between the pipeline and at least one shipper not affiliated with the pipeline.
Federal Leases. We maintain operations located on federal oil and natural gas leases, which are administered by the BOEM or the BSEE, pursuant to the OCSLA. The BOEM handles offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies, and the BSEE is responsible for the safety and enforcement functions of offshore oil and gas operations, including the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting of offshore exploration, development and production activities, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs. We are currently subject to regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all production facilities, structures and pipelines, and the BOEM or the BSEE may in the future amend these regulations.
To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Outer Continental Shelf (the “OCS”), the BOEM generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied. While we were exempt from such supplemental bonding requirements in the past, beginning in 2014 we were required to post supplemental bonding or alternate form of collateral for certain of our offshore properties. As a result, we engaged a number of surety companies to post the requisite bonds. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with these surety companies, we had provided cash deposits of $12.7 million as collateral to support certain of the bonds that are issued on our behalf. As a result of the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets in January 2018, the majority of all cash deposits have been refunded as of the date hereof.
The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) in the U.S. Department of the Interior administers the collection of royalties under the terms of the OCSLA and the oil and natural gas leases issued thereunder. The amount of royalties due is based upon the terms of the oil and natural gas leases as well as the regulations promulgated by the ONRR.

State Regulations
Most states regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including:

• | requirements for obtaining drilling permits;


• | the method of developing new fields;


• | the spacing and operation of wells;


• | the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources; and


• | the plugging and abandonment of wells.

The rate of production may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from both oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis or both.
We may enter into agreements relating to the construction or operation of a pipeline system for the transportation of natural gas. To the extent that such gas is produced, transported and consumed wholly within one state, such operations may, in certain instances, be subject to the jurisdiction of such state’s administrative authority charged with the responsibility of regulating intrastate pipelines. In such event, the rates that we could charge for gas, the transportation of gas, and the construction and operation of such pipeline would be subject to the rules and regulations governing such matters, if any, of such administrative authority.
Legislative Proposals
In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation. New legislative proposals in Congress and the various state legislatures, if enacted, could significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on our operations.
Environmental Regulations
General. Our activities are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and rules regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to our existing assets and operations. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations could have on our activities.
Our activities with respect to exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including the drilling of wells and the operation and construction of pipelines and other facilities for extracting, transporting or storing natural gas and other petroleum products, are subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “USEPA”). Such regulation can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating such facilities. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas production operations, and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Moreover it is possible that other developments, such as spills or other unanticipated releases, stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, would result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.
Solid and Hazardous Waste.  We own or lease numerous properties that have been used for production of oil and gas for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or solid wastes may have been disposed or released on or under these properties. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties that controlled the handling of hydrocarbons or solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination.
Wastes, including hazardous wastes, are subject to regulation under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state statutes. Much of the waste we generate in our operations, including hazardous waste, is exempt from regulation under RCRA, but generally remains subject to state storage, treatment and disposal requirements. The USEPA has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and gas operations which are 
#17#

currently exempt from regulation under RCRA as “hazardous wastes” may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements.
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) are radioactive materials which precipitate on production equipment or area soils during oil and natural gas extraction or processing. NORM wastes are regulated under the RCRA framework, although such wastes may qualify for the oil and gas hazardous waste exclusion. Primary responsibility for NORM regulation has been a state function. Standards have been developed for worker protection; treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste; management of waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations upon the release of NORM-contaminated land for unrestricted use. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with all applicable NORM standards.
Superfund. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release or threatened release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Liable persons under CERCLA include the owner and operator of a site and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the USEPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action from the responsible persons. State statutes impose similar liability.
Under CERCLA, the term “hazardous substance” does not include “petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof,” unless specifically listed or designated and the term does not include natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel. While this “petroleum exclusion” lessens the significance of CERCLA to our operations, we may generate waste that may fall within CERCLA's definition of a “hazardous substance” in the course of our ordinary operations. We also currently own or lease properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Although we and, to our knowledge, our predecessors have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, “hazardous substances” may have been disposed or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. At this time, we do not believe that we have any liability associated with any Superfund site, and we have not been notified of any claim, liability or damages under CERCLA.
Endangered Species Act. Federal and state legislation including, in particular, the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (“ESA”), impose requirements to protect imperiled species from extinction by conserving and protecting threatened and endangered species and the habitat upon which they depend. With specified exceptions, the ESA prohibits the “taking,” including killing, harassing or harming, of any listed threatened or endangered species, as well as any degradation or destruction of its habitat. In addition, the ESA mandates that federal agencies carry out programs for conservation of listed species. Many state laws similarly protect threatened and endangered species and their habitat. We operate in areas in which listed species may be present. As a result, we may be required to adopt protective measures, obtain incidental take permits, and otherwise adjust our drilling plans to comply with ESA requirements.
Discharges. The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) regulates the discharge of pollutants to Waters of the United States ("WOTUS"), including wetlands, and requires a permit for the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, to such waters. The CWA also prohibits spills of oil and hazardous substances to WOTUS in excess of levels set by regulations and imposes liability in the event of a spill. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to such waters. The CWA also requires a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into wetlands. A revised regulatory definition of WOTUS that would expand the applicability of CWA requirements was promulgated in 2015, but these regulations have since been subject to judicial challenges and administrative action resulting in uncertainties about the scope of the WOTUS definition. When the WOTUS definition is ultimately resolved, CWA obligations may be expanded. State laws further provide civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for spills to both surface and ground waters and require permits that set limits on discharges to such waters. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and that any noncompliance would not have a material adverse effect on us.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our exploration and production activities may involve the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques to stimulate wells and maximize natural gas production. Citing concerns over the potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water, human health and the environment, and in response to a Congressional directive, the USEPA commissioned a study to identify potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and to improve scientific understanding to guide USEPA’s regulatory oversight, guidance and, where appropriate, rulemaking related to hydraulic fracturing. A final report for this study was released in December 2016 and provided information regarding potential vulnerability of drinking water resources to hydraulic fracturing, but did not reach conclusions regarding the frequency or severity of impacts due to data gaps and uncertainties. Some states now regulate utilization of hydraulic fracturing and others are in the process of developing, or are considering development of, such rules to address the potential for drinking water impacts, induced seismicity, and other concerns. In several localities and in New York, use of hydraulic fracturing has been banned, although local fracking bans are prohibited in Texas and Louisiana, 
#18#

which currently address hydraulic fracturing concerns by requiring disclosures of the content of fluids used in the process. Our drilling activities could be subjected to new or enhanced federal, state and/or local requirements governing hydraulic fracturing.
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits may be resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could impose civil or criminal liability for non-compliance. An agency could require us to forego construction or operation of certain air emission sources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with air pollution control requirements.
According to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases (“GHG”) may be contributing to global warming of the earth's atmosphere and to global climate change. In response to the scientific studies, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been underway to limit GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) definition of an “air pollutant”, and in response the USEPA promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. The USEPA has also promulgated rules requiring large sources to report their GHG emissions. We are not subject to GHG reporting requirements. In addition, the USEPA promulgated rules that significantly increase the GHG emission threshold that would identify major stationary sources of GHG subject to CAA permitting programs. We are not currently subject to federal GHG permitting requirements, but regulation of GHG emissions is developing and highly controversial, and further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments may occur and may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact the Company. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, the Company cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on the Company. 
The USEPA has promulgated rules to limit air emissions from many hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These regulations have been highly controversial, have been challenged, and their future is uncertain. While such requirements would be expected to increase the cost of natural gas production, we do not anticipate that we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
Coastal Coordination. There are various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. The federal Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”) was passed to preserve and, where possible, restore the natural resources of the Nation's coastal zone. The CZMA provides for federal grants for state management programs that regulate land use, water use and coastal development.
The Louisiana Coastal Zone Management Program (“LCZMP”) was established to protect, develop and, where feasible, restore and enhance coastal resources of the state. Under the LCZMP, coastal use permits are required for certain activities, even if the activity only partially infringes on the coastal zone. Among other things, projects involving use of state lands and water bottoms, dredge or fill activities that intersect with more than one body of water, mineral activities, including the exploration and production of oil and gas, and pipelines for the gathering, transportation or transmission of oil, gas and other minerals require such permits. General permits, which entail a reduced administrative burden, are available for a number of routine oil and gas activities. The LCZMP and its requirement to obtain coastal use permits may result in additional permitting requirements and associated project schedule constraints.
OSHA. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the USEPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and similar state statutes require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens.
Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations described above and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us.
Corporate Offices
Our headquarters are located in Lafayette, Louisiana, in approximately 46,600 square feet of leased space, with an exploration office in The Woodlands, Texas in approximately 5,400 square feet of leased space. We also maintain owned or leased field offices in the areas of the major fields in which we operate properties or have a significant interest. Replacement of any of our leased offices would not result in material expenditures by us as alternative locations to our leased space are anticipated to be readily available.
#19#

Employees
We had 54 full-time employees as of February 28, 2019. In addition to our full time employees, we utilize the services of independent contractors to perform certain functions. We believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
