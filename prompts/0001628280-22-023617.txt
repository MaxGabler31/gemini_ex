ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Overview
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our”, “Lumentum” or the “Company”) is an industry-leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share addressing a range of end-market applications including Optical Communications (“OpComms”) and Commercial Lasers (“Lasers”) for manufacturing, inspection and life-science applications. We seek to use our core optical and photonic technology, and our volume manufacturing capability, to expand into attractive emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide, including 3D sensing for consumer electronics and diode light sources for a variety of automotive, consumer and industrial applications. The majority of our customers tend to be original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that incorporate our products into their products which then address end-market applications. For example, we sell fiber optic components that network equipment manufacturers (“NEMs”) assemble into communications networking systems, which they sell to communication service providers, hyperscale cloud operators and enterprises with their own networks. Similarly, many of our customers for our Lasers products incorporate our products into tools they produce, which are used for manufacturing processes by their customers. For 3D sensing, we sell diode lasers to manufacturers of consumer electronics products for mobile, personal computing, gaming, and other applications, including to the automotive industry, who then integrate our devices within their products, for eventual resale to consumers and also into other industrial applications.
We believe the global markets in which Lumentum participates have fundamentally robust, long-term trends that increase the need for our photonics products and technologies. We believe the world is becoming more reliant on ever-increasing amounts of data flowing through optical networks and data centers. Lumentum’s products and technology enable the scaling of these optical networks and data centers to higher capacities. We expect the accelerating shift to digital and virtual approaches to all aspects of work and life that is driving staggering amounts of data in the world’s networks and cloud datacenters will continue into the future. Virtual meetings, video calls, and hybrid in-person and virtual environments for work and other aspects of life will continue to drive strong needs for bandwidth growth and present dynamic new challenges that our technology addresses. As manufacturers demand higher levels of precision, new materials, and factory and energy efficiency, suppliers of manufacturing tools globally are turning to laser-based approaches, including the types of lasers Lumentum supplies. Laser-based 3D sensing and LiDAR for security, industrial and automotive applications are rapidly developing markets. The technology enables computer vision applications that enhance security, safety, and new functionality in the electronic devices that people rely on every day. The use of LiDAR and in-cabin 3D sensing in automobile and delivery vehicles over time significantly adds to our long-term market opportunity. Frictionless and contactless biometric security and access control is of increasing focus globally given the world’s experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we expect 3D-enabled machine vision solutions to expand significantly in industrial applications in the coming years. 
We operate in two reportable segments: OpComms and Lasers.
We have a global marketing and sales footprint that enables us to address global market opportunities for our products. We have manufacturing capabilities and facilities in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, with employees engaged in research and development (“R&D”), administration, manufacturing, support and sales and marketing activities. Our headquarters are located in San Jose, California, and we employed approximately 6,815 full-time employees around the world as of July 2, 2022.
Lumentum was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”) on February 10, 2015. In August 2015, we were spun-off from JDSU and became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution of our common stock by JDSU to its stockholders (the “Separation”). In 2015, JDSU was renamed Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi”). Our business traces its origins to Uniphase Corporation, which was formed in 1979 and became publicly traded in 1992. Uniphase was originally a supplier of commercial lasers, and later, a leading supplier of optical transmission products. In 1999, JDS Fitel Inc., a pioneer in products for fiber optic networking which was formed in 1981, merged with Uniphase to become JDSU, a global leader in optical networking. Subsequent acquisitions by JDSU broadened the depth and breadth of the OpComms and Lasers businesses, as well as the intellectual property, technology and product offerings, of what is now Lumentum. Notable amongst these acquisitions in the OpComms business were Agility Communications, Inc. in 2005 and Picolight, Inc. in 2007, which respectively brought widely tunable, long wavelength laser technology for metro and long haul networking applications and short wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) for enterprise, datacenter networking, and 3D sensing applications. The fundamental laser component technologies, which we acquired through these acquisitions, form the basis of optical networks today, and we believe will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These technologies will enable us to develop highly integrated products to satisfy our communications customers’ ever-increasing needs for smaller, lower power and lower cost optical products. Notable acquisitions in the Lasers business were Lightwave Electronics Corporation in 2005 and Time-Bandwidth Products Inc. (“Time-Bandwidth”) in 2014. Both of these Lasers acquisitions brought high power pulsed solid-state laser products and technology to our business, which address the micro machining laser market and expanded our addressable market. 
In December 2018, we completed the acquisition of Oclaro, Inc. (“Oclaro”), a provider of optical components and modules for the long-haul, metro and data center markets. Oclaro’s products provide differentiated solutions for optical networks and high-speed interconnects driving the next wave of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization and other bandwidth-intensive and high-speed applications. This acquisition strengthened our product portfolio, by adding Oclaro’s indium phosphide laser and photonic integrated circuit and coherent component and module capabilities which broadened our revenue mix and positions us strongly to meet the future needs of our customers. 
On August 3, 2022, we completed our merger (“the Merger”) with NeoPhotonics Corporation (“NeoPhotonics”), which we expect to expand our opportunities in the market for optical components used in cloud and telecom network infrastructure. 
Internet, cloud, mobile, and broadband access network capacity requirements continue to grow at an unrelenting pace driven by the digital transformation of work and life, high-bandwidth video, gaming, and other applications. After the Merger, Lumentum has a broader portfolio of next generation products and technologies positioned to address the market opportunity created by this strong growth in network capacity requirements, including NeoPhotonics ultra-pure light tunable lasers and photonics technologies for speed over distance applications.
On August 15, 2022, we completed a transaction to acquire a business that develops and markets products for use in telecommunications and datacenter infrastructure, including Digital Signal Processors (DSP’s), ASICs and optical transceivers. This acquisition will enable us to expand our business in our OpComms segment.
Industry Trends and Business Risks
Our business is driven by end-market applications which benefit from the performance advantages of optical and photonics solutions.
The OpComms markets we serve are experiencing continually increasing needs for higher data transmission speeds, fiber optic network capacity and network agility. This is driven by rapid growth in both the number of higher bandwidth broadband applications such as high-definition video, online gaming, cloud computing and the number and scale of datacenters that require fiber optic links to enable the higher speeds and increased scale necessary to deliver high bandwidth video and other services. Our technology, which was originally developed for communications applications, is also finding use in other emerging market opportunities including 3D sensing applications that employ our laser technology in mobile devices, computers, augmented and virtual reality and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, our products have been and are continuing to be designed into emerging automotive, industrial, security, safety and surveillance applications.
In the Lasers markets, customer demand is driven by the need to enable faster, higher precision volume manufacturing techniques with lower power consumption, more environmentally friendly, reduced manufacturing footprint and increased productivity. These capabilities are critical as industries develop products that are smaller and lighter, increasing productivity and yield and lowering their energy consumption. 
Our optical and laser solutions, developed in close collaboration with OEM partners, are well-positioned to meet demand resulting from these trends. We do, however, expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, profitability and general financial performance and could create quarter over quarter variability in our financial measures. For example, the demand environment coupled with changing export regulations with China have fluctuated significantly in recent years and has created volatility and uncertainty in our future demand.
Impact of COVID-19 to Our Business
Since February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health officials to recommend, and governments to enact, precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions and bans, extensive social distancing guidelines, closure or restrictions on business and quarantine or other types of “shelter-in-place” orders in many regions of the world. The pandemic and these related responses continue to cause a global slowdown of economic activity (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, labor shortages, and significant volatility and potential disruption of financial markets. The ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict, including the effectiveness and utilization of vaccines for COVID-19 and its variants, the severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and the effectiveness of the actions to contain or limit their spread.
From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively implemented preventative measures and protocols, which we continuously assess and update for changes in conditions and emerging trends. Some of these measures have included complying with local, state or federal orders that require employees to work from home, instructing employees to work from home in certain jurisdictions, limiting the number of employees onsite which slowed our manufacturing operations in certain countries, enhancing use of personal protective equipment and restricting non-critical business travel by our employees, enacting vaccine and testing mandates in certain jurisdictions, and implementing health and safety enhancements. These measures are intended to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and communities, and to ensure business continuity. Currently, our major production facilities in Europe, Asia, and the United States remain open. At most of our locations, we have transitioned from business continuity plans to return-to-office plans while continuing to maintain high standards of employee safety and sanitization protocols. 
In the geographies where we have operations, we have, in general and where applicable, been deemed an essential business and been permitted to continue manufacturing and conducting new product development operations in a more limited capacity during the pandemic. This stems from our critical role in global supply chains for the world’s communications and health-care systems. However, the pandemic continues to affect our suppliers and manufacturers who are experiencing component materials and labor shortages. Given the continually evolving situation, particularly in light of the recent Delta and Omicron variants, it is difficult to predict the magnitude and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our markets, its effects, or precisely when our ability to supply our products will return to full capacity. We are continuing to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, communities, business partners, suppliers and stockholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees and prospects, or on our financial results for the future.
Our primary strategic focus for several years has been technology and product leadership combined with close customer relationships in long-term healthy and growing markets. We believe this strategy is even more apt, and our long-term opportunity is not diminished, with COVID-19. We believe there are long-term opportunities, as the world’s experience with COVID-19 could drive an increasingly digital and virtual world, touching all aspects of life and work, that increasingly emphasizes the importance of communications systems, cloud services, augmented and virtual reality, and enhanced security. Additionally, ever advancing electronic devices are needed to consume, produce, and communicate digital and virtual content. All these trends could drive the need for higher volumes of higher performing optical devices that we could supply. As such, we expect to continue to invest strongly in new products, technology and customer programs.
For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 outbreak and regulatory actions, please refer to the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Supply Chain Constraints
Our business and our customers’ businesses have been negatively impacted by worldwide logistics and supply chain issues, including constraints on available cargo capabilities and limited availability of once broadly available supplies of both raw materials and finished components. COVID-19 has also created dynamics in the semiconductor component supply chains that have led to shortages of the types of components we and our customers require in our products. These shortages have impacted our ability to meet demand and generate revenue from certain products in fiscal 2022 and, they continue to impact our ability to meet demand today. If our ability to procure needed semiconductor components does not improve, this will impact our ability to supply our products to our customers and may reduce our revenue and profit margin. In addition, if our customers are unable to procure needed semiconductor components, this could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our revenue. The impact of semiconductor component shortages may continue in the near term as supplier and customer buffer inventories and safety stocks are exhausted. Due to the global supply chain constraint, we have had to incur incremental supply and procurement costs in order to increase our ability to fulfill demands from our customers. These costs have increased our inventory balances as of July 2, 2022 and may decrease our gross margin in the near term. We expect component supply to be a challenge at least into the second half of fiscal 2023. For more information on risks associated with supply chain constraints, please refer to the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Reportable Segments
We have two operating segments, OpComms and Lasers. The two operating segments were primarily determined based on how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by our CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments. We do not track our property, plant, and equipment by operating segments. For the geographic identification of these assets and for further information regarding our operating segments, please refer to “Note 19. Operating Segments and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial statements.
OpComms
Markets
Our OpComms products address the following markets: telecommunications (“Telecom”), data communications (“Datacom”) and consumer and industrial (“Consumer and Industrial”). 
Our OpComms products include a wide range of components, modules and subsystems to support customers including carrier networks for access (local), metro (intracity), long-haul (city-to-city and worldwide) and submarine (undersea) applications. Additionally, our products address enterprise, cloud, and data center applications, including storage-access networks (“SANs”), local-area networks (“LANs”) and wide-area networks (“WANs”). These products enable the transmission and transport of video, audio and data over high-capacity fiber-optic cables. We maintain leading positions in these fast growing OpComms markets through our extensive product portfolio, including reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (“ROADMs”), coherent dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”) pluggable transceivers, and tunable small form-factor pluggable transceivers. We also sell laser chips for use in manufacturing of high-speed Datacom transceivers. 
In the Consumer and Industrial market, our OpComms diode laser products include vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) and edge emitting lasers. In the Consumer end-market, our laser light sources are integrated into 3D sensing cameras which are used in applications in mobile devices, gaming, payment kiosks, computers, and other consumer electronics devices. Applications include biometric identification, computational photography, virtual and augmented reality, and natural user interfaces. Emerging applications for our lasers include automotive safety systems, LiDAR for advanced driver assistance systems in automobiles and autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications, and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D imaging or printing. In the industrial end-market, our diode lasers are used primarily as pump sources for pulsed and kilowatt class fiber lasers.

Trends 
We believe the optical communications market has started to expand beyond a small number of very large service providers, and is transitioning to a variety of open and captive networks created for in-house use by large video services, search engines and companies offering a variety of cloud computing services. We believe that the trend towards an increase in demand for optical solutions, which increase network capacity, is in response to growing bandwidth demand driven by increased transmission of video, voice and data over optical communications networks. Additionally, service providers also seek to decrease the total cost of ownership of their networks. To remain competitive, network operators worldwide must offer broader suites of digital services at competitive prices. To do this, they are migrating to Internet-protocol (“IP”) networks and expanding long-haul, metro regional and metro access networks, which effectively deliver broadband services, while lowering capital and operating costs of dense-wavelength-division multiplexing networks.
The growing demand for capacity encourages the adoption of OpComms products across the Datacom and Telecom markets. Demand for capacity in the Datacom market is driven by the growing needs of LANs and WANs. Growth in Datacom is also driven by web and cloud services companies that are expanding data center infrastructure, increasing the need for network capacity within and between these data centers. 
Demand in the Telecom market is driven by new and existing bandwidth-intensive applications that can result in sudden and severe changes in demand almost anywhere on the network. Increasing agility in optical networks by employing ROADMs, wavelength selective switches, wavelength tunable transmission products and other agile optical products provides an effective way to respond to unpredictable bandwidth demands and to manage expenses. With more agile optical networks, a network operator can add capacity by using remote management applications rather than dispatching technicians to perform manual operations in the field. 
In addition, the high-end routers, switches and cross-connect equipment that must handle legacy and internet-protocol traffic are becoming increasingly complex in order to meet higher bandwidth, scalability, speed and reliability needs. Products 
must provide higher levels of functionality and performance in compact designs that must also meet requirements for quality, reliability, and cost. 
We believe increasing speeds at the edge of the network, including the significant increase in speed in 5G mobile networks, combined with increasing demand for high bandwidth applications and services, including streaming video, will result in increasing demand for additional capacity in datacenter interconnect, metro regional and long-haul networks. The dynamically reconfigurable nature of today’s networks enables lower operating costs and other competitive advantages, allowing communications service providers to use and scale network capacity more flexibly, streamline service provisioning, accelerate rerouting around points of failure and modify network topology through simple point-and-click network management systems.
Our optical products are well-positioned to meet these demands. Our innovations, particularly in the area of photonic integration, have resulted in products that have more functionality, are significantly smaller in size, require less power, and are more cost-effective than our historical products. Higher levels of integration have also led to development of our Super Transport Blade, which delivers all transport functions (wavelength switching, pre-amplification, post-amplification, optical supervisory channel and monitoring) in a single, integrated platform, essentially replacing three blades with one.
Offerings
In addition to a full selection of active and passive components, we offer increasing levels of functionality and integration in modules, circuit packs and subsystems for transmission, amplification, wavelength management and more. 
In the Telecom market, we provide transmission and transport solutions for optical networks that make up the backbone of the wireline Telecom infrastructure, thereby enabling the internet, connections between cloud datacenters, and backhaul of data from wireless mobile networks. Transmission products, such as our tunable transponder, transceiver and transmitter modules, transmit and receive high-speed data signals at the ingress/egress points of networks. These products use dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”) technology to maximize the fiber transmission capacity while lowering the cost per bit to meet the needs of increasing internet and cloud demand. We also offer components including tunable lasers, receivers and modulators to address the higher end of these same network applications.
Our transport products, such as ROADMs, amplifiers and optical channel monitors provide switching, routing and the conditioning of optical signals. We also make components for transport, including 980nm, multi-mode and Raman pumps for optical amplifiers, and passive components. Passive components include switches, attenuators, photodetectors, gain flattening filters, isolators, wavelength-division multiplexing (“WDM”) filters, arrayed waveguide gratings (“AWGs”), multiplex/de-multiplexers and integrated passive modules. 
Our innovation led to the Super Transport Blade, which integrates all major optical transport functions into a single-slot blade. This all-in-one solution reduces the size, cost and power requirements of optical components, incorporates nano wavelength selective switch technology and enables greater chassis density and a smaller footprint.
In the Datacom market, optical transceivers are used to connect servers, switches, routers and other information technology infrastructure critical for today’s internet applications, web services, video streaming, enterprise networks and service provider solutions. The cloud data center market is one of the fastest growing segments in optical communications both in terms of network equipment investments and increasing volumes of higher speed optical transceivers. Additionally, the increased bandwidth needs of 5G wireless applications will drive growth in the volumes of high speed optical transceivers. Historically, we have supplied optical transceivers, but we have shifted our strategy to supplying the underlying optical components, high-speed source lasers and receiver photo diodes used in optical transceivers to address these market segments.
For the 100G and higher data rates, we offer several source laser technologies to balance technical and commercial requirements. For high volume, short distance applications we developed our vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (“VCSELs”). VCSELs are ideal for short reach applications because they enable low power, low cost optical solutions that are highly scalable. For high-performance, longer distance applications we have our directly modulated laser (“DML”) and electro-absorption modulated laser (“EML”) chips supporting module applications with speeds from 10Gb/s through 800Gb/s. Our individual lasers and compact laser arrays offer an innovative solution for the LANs, SANs, broadband Internet, 5G Wireless and metro-area network as well as hyperscale datacenter applications.
Our 3D sensing technology enables real time depth information to any photo or video image. This represents a fundamental transition for image capture akin to the transition from monochrome to color and gives devices the ability to see the world around them in three dimensions. The immediate applications include full body imaging for gaming, 3D scanning for space mapping, computational photography and facial recognition for security. Emerging applications for this technology include various mobile device applications, autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D printing. 3D sensing can be applied to any device with a camera. The technologies to achieve accurate and stable 3D sensing are converging to laser based solutions. We are a leading supplier of the critical laser 
illumination sources for 3D sensing systems being used in applications for gaming, computing, mobile devices, and home entertainment.
Strategy 
In our OpComms segment, we are focused on technology leadership through innovation with our customers, cost leadership and functional integration. We endeavor to align the latest technologies with industry leading, scalable manufacturing and operations to drive the next phase of optical communications technologies and products for Telecom and Datacom applications that are faster, more energy efficient, more agile and more reliable, making us a valuable business and technology partner for NEMs, network operators, consumer electronic companies, cloud service providers and data center operators.

Some of these competitors are also our customers.
Lasers
Markets
Our Lasers products serve our customers in markets and applications such as sheet metal processing, general manufacturing, biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and precision machining such as drilling in printed circuit boards, wafer singulation, glass cutting and solar cell scribing. 
Our Lasers products are used in a variety of OEM applications including diode-pumped solid-state, fiber, diode, direct-diode and gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers. Fiber lasers provide kW-class output powers combined with excellent beam quality and are used in sheet metal processing and metal welding applications. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers provide excellent beam quality, low noise and exceptional reliability and are used in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and precision machining applications. Diode and direct-diode lasers address a wide variety of applications, including laser pumping, thermal exposure, illumination, ophthalmology, image recording, printing, plastic welding and selective soldering. Gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers provide a stable, low-cost and reliable solution over a wide range of operating conditions, making them well-suited for complex, high-resolution OEM applications such as flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, graphics and imaging and semiconductor inspection. 
We also provide high-powered and ultrafast lasers for the industrial and scientific markets. Manufacturers use high-power, ultrafast lasers to create micro parts for consumer electronics and to process semiconductor, LED, and other types of chips. Use of ultrafast lasers for micromachining applications is being driven primarily by the increasing use of consumer electronics and connected devices globally. 
Our portfolio of Lasers products includes components and subsystems used in a variety of OEM applications that range in output power from milliwatts to kilowatts and include ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. We support customer applications in the biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and other precision machining areas.

During fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not have any single customer attributable to our Lasers segment that generated net revenue of 10% or more of our total net revenue for the applicable fiscal year.
Trends
As technology advances, industries such as consumer electronics manufacturing increasingly turn to lasers when they need more precision, higher productivity and energy efficient, or “green,” alternatives for problems that cannot be solved by mechanical, electronic or other means. For example, these industries are using lasers to develop products that are smaller and lighter to increase productivity and yield and to lower their energy consumption. Lasers have been used for years to help achieve the scale and precision needed in semiconductor processing. In biotech applications, lasers have been instrumental for advances (and new standard procedures) in cytology, hematology, genome sequencing and crime scene investigations, among others. We believe the long-term trends in these industries will likely lead to increased demand for lasers. 
Sheet metal processing and metal welding applications are increasingly using kW-class fiber lasers instead of kW-class CO2 lasers. Fiber lasers generate higher productivity at lower cost in such applications because they exhibit lower power consumption, better quality and generally lower user maintenance costs.
In addition, demand continues for electronic products, as well as products and components in other industries, with greater functionality while becoming smaller, lighter and less expensive. Innovative next generation product designs require precise micromachining and materials processing, such as micro bending, soldering and welding. At the scale and processing speed needed, lasers are replacing mature mechanical tools such as drills for minute holes, or “vias,” in printed circuit boards and saws and scribes for singulation of silicon and other types of wafers, resulting in greater precision and productivity. As these trends continue, we believe that manufacturers and other industries will increase their reliance on lasers in order to maintain or increase their competitiveness. 
We believe we are well-positioned with key OEM providers of laser solutions to these industries. We continue to develop our laser portfolio to offer smaller, more energy efficient and more cost-effective products designed specifically for the performance, integration, reliability and support needs of our OEM customers.

The addition of NeoPhotonics expands Lumentum’s opportunity in some of the fastest growing markets for optical components used in cloud and telecom network infrastructure. We expect the integrated company to be better positioned to serve the needs of a global customer base who is increasingly utilizing photonics to accelerate the shift to digital and virtual approaches to work and life, the proliferation of IoT, 5G, and next-generation mobile networks, and the transition to advanced cloud computing 
architectures. Please refer to “Note 4. Business Combination” to the consolidated financial statements. 
Other Acquisition
On August 15, 2022, we completed a transaction to acquire a business that develops and markets products for use in telecommunications and datacenter infrastructure, including Digital Signal Processor (DSP’s), ASICs and optical transceivers. This acquisition will help us to expand our business in our OpComms segment. Please refer to “Note 21. Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements. 
Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to research and development (“R&D”) for the development of new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our OpComms segment, we are maintaining our capability to provide products throughout the network, while focusing on several important sub-segments. We continue to maintain strong investments in Telecom components and modules such as ROADMs and tunable devices needed for long-haul and metro markets, as well as high performance DML, EML, and VCSEL chips for Datacom transceivers. We are also responding to our customers’ requests for higher levels of integration, including the integration of optics, electronics and software in our modules, subsystems and circuit packs. We are providing optical technology for 3D sensing systems that simplify the way that people interact with technology. These solutions are initially being used in consumer electronics, mobile device, automotive, and industrial applications.
In our Lasers segment, we continue to develop new product offerings in both solid-state and fiber lasers that take advantage of technologies and components we develop. These products are targeted at serving customers engaging in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and materials processing and precision micromachining markets.
Manufacturing
We use a combination of contract manufacturers and our own manufacturing facilities. Our significant manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, China, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Japan.
In fiscal 2022, we retained the same manufacturing footprint as we had in 2021, with the focus on Business Continuity Planning (BCP) for our own manufacturing facilities and contract manufacturing sites to ensure we have alternate sources and flexibility for some of our higher demand products. In addition, we purchased land and buildings in Thailand and Slovenia with a fair value of $15.1 million in order to expand our manufacturing capacity. Please refer to “Note 8. Balance Sheet Details” to the consolidated financial statements.
In fiscal 2021, we transitioned manufacturing of our backend wafer and test processes from San Jose, California to our other manufacturing operations. We also ceased manufacturing certain of our specialty products in San Jose, transferring the raw materials to the existing customer.
In fiscal 2020, as part of our plan to discontinue development and manufacturing of Lithium Niobate modulators, we sold the assets associated with certain Lithium Niobate product lines manufactured by our San Donato, Italy site. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we discontinued the development and manufacturing of future Datacom transceiver modules which impacted the California and China based Datacom module teams. This affected manufacturing in our Thailand factory as well. Following the Oclaro acquisition, we have a differentiated leadership position across a range of photonic chips on which the Datacom, wireless, and access markets critically rely. 
Our significant contract manufacturing partners are located primarily in Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia. We rely on the capabilities of our contract manufacturers to plan and procure components and manage the inventory in these locations.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for manufacturing and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all, such as the current shortages in semiconductor components; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such supply could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of July 2, 2022, we owned approximately 915 U.S. patents and 900 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from July 2022 through August 2041, and had approximately 600 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Seasonality
Our revenue may be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. Some of our products may be incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products for which we have assigned shipment dates.
As of July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, our backlog was $594.0 million and $521.1 million, respectively. Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period. A significant portion of our revenue arises from vendor-managed inventory (VMI) arrangements where the timing and volume of customer utilization is difficult to predict. Products that are shipped through VMI are not included our reported backlog amounts above.
Human Capital Resources
As of July 2, 2022, we employed approximately 6,815 full-time employees, including approximately 5,169 employees in manufacturing, 897 employees in R&D and 749 employees in SG&A. As of July 2, 2022, we employed approximately 6,815 full-time employees, including approximately 5,169 employees in manufacturing, 897 employees in R&D and 749 employees in SG&A. Of the 6,815 employees, 20% are represented by two national collective bargaining agreements with local chapters and one labor union. One of collective bargaining agreements will come up for renewal in December 2022. We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
We believe that the future performance of our Company relies upon the strength of our employees, and our ability to recruit, retain, develop and motivate the services of executive, engineering, sales and marketing, and support personnel is critical to our success. We strive to meet these objectives by offering competitive pay and benefits in a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace and by providing opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers. We believe that our employee relations are strong.
Competitive Pay and Benefits 
We provide compensation and benefits packages that we believe are competitive within the applicable market. We use a combination of compensation and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract, motivate and retain our employees, including semi-annual performance bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, tuition assistance programs, health and wellness benefits and programs, and on-site fitness centers. We review our benefits packages annually, or more frequently as needed, to ensure we remain competitive with our peers and continue to attract and retain talent throughout our organization. 
Employee Recruitment, Retention and Development
We are committed to recruiting, hiring, retaining, promoting and engaging a diverse workforce to best serve our global customers. We have established relationships with professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent, and we partner with universities for our internship program. We believe that our commitment to our internship program and university partnerships contributes to developing the next generation of talent and provides a pipeline of recent college graduates into our talent pool. We offered both remote and hybrid internship opportunities during the last three fiscal years that enabled us to continue building our talent pipeline despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging 
As a global and multicultural company driven by innovation, Lumentum is building a diverse and inclusive culture where differences are valued, and employees feel they belong. Lumentum’s focus on diversity, inclusion, and belonging is felt across 
the entire organization. We are committed to creating a diverse and welcoming workplace that includes employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Lumentum believes that employee and thought diversity delivers more innovation and ultimately better business results. 
As part of our efforts continue to ensure Lumentum’s practices support a culture of diversity through our commitment to ensuring pay equity as a standard global practice, increasing the representation of underrepresented populations, increasing the percentage of women in senior leadership positions, and developing a pipeline of future leaders through our early career hire initiatives for new employees. Our work is driven by a Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Council comprised of global representation of all business units and functions. Our diversity work is also enhanced by employee resource groups supporting women in North America, Switzerland, Slovenia, UK, Italy, and Japan, early career hires in North America and EMEA, Black, Asian American and Pacific Islander, LatinX in North America, LGBTQIA+, Persons with Disabilities, Working Parents, and our Veteran employees.
Material Government Regulations
Our business activities are international and subject us to various federal, state, local and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate, and our products and services are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products.
Environment 
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
In connection with our separation from JDSU and trading as an independent public company, we agreed to indemnify Viavi for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred to us from Viavi, to the extent the resulting issues primarily related to our business. We have not been presented with any claims to date.
Global Trade 
As our business operates in many global jurisdictions, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world which vary widely across different countries and may change from time to time. Such laws, rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or by requiring us to comply laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology. For example, the U.S. and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of, among other things, certain telecommunications products and components. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business in certain areas or with certain customers. 
For additional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Report. 
International Operations
During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, net revenue from customers outside the United States based on the geographic region and country where our product is initially shipped, represented 89.8%, 92.3% and 91.1% of net revenue, respectively. In certain circumstances customers may request shipment of our products to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers. Our net revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, including our net revenue from customers outside the United States based on customer shipment locations as presented above. Please refer to “Note 19. Operating Segments and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial statements. For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
