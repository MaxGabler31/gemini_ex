ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
History and Organization
 
We were incorporated on December 20, 2010 in the State of Nevada as Accend Media. On May 23, 2012 we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with Cloud Star Corporation, a Nevada corporation, and we changed our name to Cloud Star Corporation (“Cloud Star”). The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Cloud Star being treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes.
 
On May 28, 2013, we changed our corporate name from Cloud Star Corporation to Cloud Security Corporation.
 
On December 8, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Goldenrise Agreement”) with Goldenrise Development, Inc. (“Goldenrise”). Under the Goldenrise Agreement, we sold 12,000,000 shares of our common stock to Goldenrise for $180,000 which equated to approximately 92% of our outstanding shares. This transaction effectuated a change in control of our Company.
 
On June 28, 2017, Goldenrise and our Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Dunn Agreement”) with Michael R. Dunn, our then sole officer and director (“Dunn”). Pursuant to Dunn Agreement, Goldenrise agreed to sell 12,000,000 shares of our common stock to Dunn representing approximately 92% of our outstanding shares. In consideration for these shares, Dunn agreed to pay Goldenrise a total of $400,000 as follows: (i) $180,000 on or before July 15, 2017 (extended to July 28, 2017), (ii) $180,000 withheld as an offset to monies owed by Goldenrise to Dunn; and (iii) $40,000 withheld and applied towards invoices related to the audit and legal fees associated with the reporting requirements of our Company through the date of Closing.
 
Concurrently, on June 28, 2017, Dunn entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with China Israel Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (“China-Israel”) and Central Bio-MD Technology Co. Ltd., each a Chinese corporation (collectively, the “Buyers” or “China-Israel”). Pursuant to the SPA, Dunn agreed to sell 6,000,000 of our common shares, representing approximately 46% of our outstanding shares. In consideration for the shares, Buyers agreed to pay Dunn a total of $200,000 upon the SPA’s execution (the “Purchase Price”).
 
The Closing for both the Dunn Agreement and the SPA occurred on July 28, 2017. The Dunn Agreement and the SPA resulted in a change in control of our Company.
 
On December 29, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an agreement and plan to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary, US-China Biomedical Technology, Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effectuate a name change from Cloud Security Corporation to US-China Biomedical Technology, Inc. (“US-China”). US-China was formed solely for the purpose of this name change and our Company was the surviving entity following the merger. On February 8, 2018, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) announced the effectiveness of a change in our Company’s name to “US-China Biomedical Technology, Inc.” and new trading symbol “UCBB” which became effective on the opening of trading as of February 9, 2018.
 Business
 
We are an early stage biomedical technology and services company. Through late 2017 our principal business was related to the software development of MyComputerKey™ and our other patented cloud computing technologies; however, due to cash flow constraints, we were unable to proceed with the further development of our software. Due to enhanced competition in the software development market and advancements in technology made by our competitors, we began evaluating alternative business plans.

Following the change in control of our Company pursuant to the SPA, we decided to put the software development on hold and shift our primary business focus. Our immediate business focus is directed at the marketing and sales in the United States of unique products and technology developed by BSP Medical Ltd. (“BSP”), an affiliate company headquartered in Israel. BSP is a biomedical technology company revolutionizing non-invasive diagnosis of cardiac diseases. BSP offers a range of electrocardiogram (“ECG”) products based on the HyperQ™ technology. These include complete systems for routine clinical use, research-oriented systems, and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) products. Research systems facilitate data analysis by exporting all test parameters and measurements in a configurable format via a web based user-friendly interface. We have begun identifying qualified physicians and additions to our management team to begin initiation of operations in the US in order to begin sales and marketing of the BSP products in the US market. In addition, we are in the process of developing a joint venture with BSP whereby we will market and sell certain of their products.
 
One BSP product of interest is the HyperQ Analyzer Stress, a unique software module designed to analyze Stress Test ECG based on the detection of changes in the high frequency component of the QRS segment. HyperQ can be integrated in any ECG stress systems.
 
Another product is the HyperQ Analyzer Rest which is an innovative software module for early detection of acute coronary artery disease on any ECG rest systems. It provides a new perspective to the clinical staff, in particular diagnosis of Non-ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI) and Unstable Angina (UA).
 
A secondary aspect of our plan is the integration and development of synergistic relationships with high profiled doctors and hospitals that will act as a bridge for connecting patients and bio-technology advances in China with our Company’s network of US based doctors and hospitals. We intend to develop a scalable biomedical bridge for the US and China markets. We will provide services for moving patients from China to the US with an emphasis on the following demographics:
 

(i) | cancer patient referrals that are in non-critical, non-life-threatening positions,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | pre-screening and genetic testing for family members of cancer patients,
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | patients suffering from Diabetes, and
------+--------------------------------------


(iv) | general medical services including preventative care and physicals.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also intend to develop working relationships with key medical innovators for possible joint ventures related to medical device manufacturing in China, including working towards obtaining China Food & Drug Administration (“CFDA”) approval for medical device sales to government owned hospitals. As of the date of this report, we have begun identifying qualified physicians and additions to our management team to begin initiation of operations in the US. The business plan is currently in the development phase.
 
Matters Relating to Former Officers and Directors
 
On November 23, 2017, our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Michael R. Dunn, passed away unexpectedly.
 
On January 9, 2018, Ms. Amanda Huang resigned as the Senior Vice President of our Company effective immediately. Our board of directors (“Board”) approved and accepted Ms. Huang’s resignation as Senior Vice President on January 10, 2018.

On July 17, 2018, our Board appointed Dr. H. Rand Scott (“Dr. Scott”) as a member of our Company’s Board to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly appointed. The Board approved and accepted Dr. Scott’s resignation as Director on January 3, 2019. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with our Company on any matter relating to our Company’s operations, policies, or practices.
 
On March 20, 2019, our Board appointed Mr. Safa Movassaghi (“Mr. Movassaghi”) as a member of our Board. Concurrently, Mr. Movassaghi resigned from his role as Vice President, a role to which he was appointed on November 6, 2018. Mr. Movassaghi’s resignation has a retroactive effective date of February 28, 2019. The resignation was not due to any disagreement with our Company, its policies or practices.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently have no intellectual property related to our current biomedical business focus. With respect to past business endeavors, we own all rights and patents associated several inventions, including the invention titled, “Apparatus Systems and Methods for Virtual Desktop Access and Management”, described under patent application (U.S. Serial Number 13/173,220) for systems and methods for accessing and managing a computer desktop, and with the invention titled, “System and Methods for One-Time Password Generation on a Mobile Computing Device”, described under patent application (U.S. Serial Number 14/295182) for process and methods of for one-time password on mobile computing devices. We have recorded a formal notice of assignment related to U.S. Serial Number 13/173220 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office previously held in the name of former executives of our Company, however U.S. Serial Number 14/295182 remained in the former executive’s name.
 
The patented system described under Serial No. 13/173220 is comprised of a removable virtual desktop Key permitting remote access and management of various computing devices that are communicatively linked to our Company’s secured cloud network. The Key allows the user secured virtual access and management of their desktop interface through a secondary computer only through unique user identification validation and a series of encrypted security file authentications including a DRM signature, a number of login credentials, and a biometric data template so even if passwords are breached the Key remains uncompromised.
 
We are not actively pursuing any business opportunities associated with our prior business endeavors.
 
Competition
 
With respect to the BSP portion of our business, we will be competing with large pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and sales corporations. For the remaining portion of our business, our potential competitors include Chinese-based patient referral companies and agencies who provide international healthcare referral services similar to what we may offer, such as Hope Noah Company in Beijing, Saint Lucia Consulting in Beijing, Shanghai Medical Tourism Products and Promotion Platform, and Ryavo Healthcare in Shanghai. Our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do, as well as established market share and the commercialization of their services. Our competitors’ services may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any services we may commercialize and may render our services obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of their development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will continue to face intense and increasing competition as new service providers enter the market and if we cannot maintain solid relationships with top tier physicians and hospitals, provide competitive products and employ an effective sales force. However, we believe that if we are able to further develop our business plan, establish solid relationships, and provide our own medical technology which has been developed by our majority shareholder, we may have key potential advantages over competitive services that could enable us to capture meaningful market share from our competitors.

Industry Regulation
 
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations related to privacy. HIPPA, data protection, and intellectual property, among others. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.
FDA Approval Requirements
 
As mentioned above, we are in the process of developing a joint venture with BSP whereby we will market and sell certain of their products. This will require that either we or BSP ensure FDA compliance in the US is obtained. We will likely engage specialists to assist us with acquiring any and all FDA approvals necessary to conduct this portion of our operations. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA pursuant to the FDCA. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market. 
 
The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, or PMA approval, process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a pre-market notification requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared devices, but have determined that, in our view, based on FDA guidance as to when to submit a 510(k) notification for changes to a cleared device, new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals are not required. We cannot assure you that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any modification, we also may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval.
 
A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
 
Trends in Medical Tourism
 
U.S. trade in health travel services (often called “medical tourism”) has grown steadily in recent years; exports (i.e., travelers coming to the United States) have doubled, and imports (U.S. travelers going abroad) have increased almost nine-fold from a low base in the early 2000’s. Despite rising costs, the U.S. health system continues to attract foreigners because of its high-quality services and its closeness to large patient markets. At the same time, more Americans are seeking more affordable care abroad, even if they must pay for their expenses out of pocket. The two most important barriers to increasing cross-border trade in health services are visa restrictions for travelers from certain countries entering the United States and a lack of coverage by many U.S. health insurers for treatments provided abroad.

In 2013, U.S. cross-border exports of health-related personal travel services were $3.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2003, for a 7.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Imports rose from $168 million in 2003 to $1.4 billion in 2013, implying a CAGR of 24%, albeit from a low base. Though health travel services represent only a small share of total trade in personal travel, they have consistently produced a trade surplus for the United States ($1.8 billion in 2013). Health travel exports grew faster than growth in spending on healthcare, with total U.S. personal healthcare expenditures rising at an average rate of 5.6% from 2002 to 2012 before slowing in 2013. The growth trend of these exports more resembles that of total U.S. travel exports, which rose 7.9% annually from 2003 to 2013.
 
About 0.5% of all air travelers entering the United States annually—between 100,000 and 200,000 people—list health treatment as a reason for visiting (this data excludes travelers from Canada and Mexico, the majority of whom travel to the United States overland). Foreign patients most often cite access to advanced medical care as their reason for traveling to this country for treatment.
 
Marketing
 
Because we are currently in the development stage of our business, we have not engaged in any marketing activities. In mid-2019 we intend to implement a comprehensive integrated plan to achieve our business objectives. Our primary objectives include building brand awareness, developing lead generation programs that will drive sales and revenue, and developing an infrastructure that supports and measures our marketing activities. Our marketing activities will be driven by our website, organic and paid search optimization, direct marketing, events, social media, and eMarketing focused on small and medium sized businesses and individuals.
Employees
 
We currently have 5 active employees. We utilize independent contractors on a part-time/as needed basis to assist in our development activities, marketing, and financial and accounting support. We are also dependent upon our officers and directors for our future business development. As our operations expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.
