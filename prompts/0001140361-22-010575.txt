ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 27, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.  We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date.  Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
On November 27, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) of 27,600,000 units, including the issuance of 3,600,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full.  Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant.  Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share.  The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $276,000,000.
 
Prior to the consummation of the Public Offering, on July 27, 2020, the Sponsor received 5,750,000 Founder Shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or $0.004 per share.  On November 23, 2020, we effected a 1,150,000 share dividend, resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 Founder Shares.  All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share dividend. On November 23, 2020, the Sponsor transferred 20,000 Founder Shares to each of David Ryan, Carman Wong and Ben Falloon for the same per-share price initially paid by the Sponsor, resulting in the Sponsor holding 6,840,000 Founder Shares.  In connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full prior to the closing of the Public Offering, on November 27, 2020, no Founder Shares were surrendered.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 10,280,000 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, to the Sponsor at the time of the Public Offering at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of approximately $10,280,000 (the “Initial Private Placement”).  The warrants sold in the Initial Private Placement, or the initial Private Placement Warrants, are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the Public Offering, except that, so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the Company completes its initial business combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) they will be entitled to registration rights. Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement, $278,760,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”).
 
On January 14, 2021, we announced that, commencing January 14, 2021, holders of the 27,600,000 units sold in the Public Offering may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “TINV.U” and the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “TINV” and “TINV WS,” respectively.
 
On May 18, 2021, we announced the approval and extension of the time period to consummate a Business Combination and the approval of the issuance and sale of certain private placement warrants in connection therewith. On May 20, 2021, the required deposit of $2,760,000 was placed into the Trust Account and on May 25, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the Sponsor 2,760,000 private placement warrants (the “First Extension Private Placement Warrants”).
 


 
On November 17, 2021, we announced the approval and extension of the time period to consummate a Business Combination and the approval of the issuance and sale of certain private placement warrants in connection therewith. On November 22, 2021, the required deposit of $2,760,000 was placed into the Trust Account and on November 23, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the Sponsor 2,760,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Second Extension Private Placement Warrants” and together with the Initial Private Placement Warrants and First Extension Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Placement Warrants”). With these extensions, the Company will have until May 27, 2022 to consummate a Business Combination. The total amount of outstanding Private Placement Warrants is 15,800,000 and the total deposits into the Trust Account have been $284,280,000 ($10.30 per public share).
 
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the funds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination; (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by May 27, 2022, unless extended at our Sponsor’s option, or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (c) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our business combination by May 27, 2022, unless extended at our Sponsor’s option by an additional 6 months, (until November 27, 2022 to complete a business combination) (such extended deadline, the “Contractual Redemption Date”) or prior to the expiration of any extended time that we have to consummate a business combination beyond November 27, 2022 as a result of a shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association (the “Extension Period”), subject to the Sponsor purchasing additional private placement warrants, subject to applicable law.  The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.  The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of its public shareholders.
 
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $9,660,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $556,649 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, $1,843,237 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Initial Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes.  The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest.
 
On March 16, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the execution and delivery of a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $2,000,000 (the “Note”) to the Sponsor, as part of the Working Capital Loans. On January 25, 2022, the Sponsor had advanced the sum of $750,000 to the Company on account of the Note. All unpaid principal under the Note shall be due and payable in full on the effective date of our initial business combination, unless accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
 
As of December 31, 2021, there was $284.4 million in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $17,499 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes.  As of February 28, 2022, there was $284.4 million in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $303,674 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes.
 
On March 16, 2022, the Company moved its headquarters and operations to Ocean Financial Centre, Level 40, 10 Collyer Quay, Singapore 049315 and changed its telephone number to +65 6808 6288.
 


 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time.  We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.  We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Selection of Target Businesses
 
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic area.  Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.  Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter.  Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
 
The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount).  We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test.  The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as a discounted cash flow valuation or the value of comparable businesses.  If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.  We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will not be the case.  Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses.  We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.  Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction.  For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target.  In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.  However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.  If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NYSE’s 80% of net assets test.  If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 


 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty.  Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations.  Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:  (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company.  A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of a majority of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy.  Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to that certain letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination.  Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a public shareholder on the record date for the shareholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.  Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days’ notice will be given of any such general meeting.
 


 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.  There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules.  However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.  None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions.  If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares.  We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.  The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination.  Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.  In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Limitation on Redemption Rights Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, without our prior consent.  We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.  Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.  By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.  However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering) for or against our initial business combination.  Our initial shareholders and officers have, pursuant to a letter agreement, and the forward purchaser has, pursuant to the forward purchase agreement, entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination.  Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from our Sponsor, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver.  However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in this offering or thereafter through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and subject to the 15% limitation in connection with any such redemption right.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until May 27, 2022 to complete our initial business combination unless extended at the option of our Sponsor.  If we have not completed an initial business combination by May 27, 2022, prior to the Contractual Redemption Date if extended at our Sponsor’s option or during the Extension Period, we will:  (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.  There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination within the allotted time frame.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions.  Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.  Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us.  Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources.  This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.  Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.  Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers: G. Raymond Zage, III, Ashish Gupta, Diana Luo and Peter Chambers.  These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination.  The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.  The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.  The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.  In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at Ocean Financial Centre, Level 40, 10 Collyer Quay, Singapore 049315, or by telephone at +65 6808 6288.
