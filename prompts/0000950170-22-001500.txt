Our Operations
 Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of increasing demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses.
 Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. When demand drops, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline at the same pace as revenues. In periods of economic contraction, we may have more significant expense deleveraging, as we believe it is prudent not to reduce selling and administrative expenses to levels that could negatively impact the long-term potential of our branch network and brands.
 The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable, with a days sales outstanding of 55 days as December 31, 2021. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable is outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows.
Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally see a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be expected to be sustained in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period.
Due to our industry’s sensitivity to economic factors, the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short-term nature of staffing assignments, it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with certainty. As a result, we monitor a number of economic indicators, as well as recent business trends, to predict future revenue trends for each of the countries and territories where we operate. Based upon these anticipated trends, we determine what level of personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities.
 During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have helped drive demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the global economy continues to grow and adapt with new technology, we are helping clients manage their workforce transformation and ensure they have the right skills now and in the future. Whether it is through workforce assessments, targeted training or by creating longer-term development paths, we help organizations and candidates adapt their skills to changing workforce needs.
 Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. These services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for over 70 years with a primary focus on the areas of office and industrial services and solutions. Our Talent Based Outsourcing offering within our Manpower brand includes outcome-based solutions such as management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities.


We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, and Finance, that include high-impact solutions, and help accelerate organizations’ growth by attracting, assessing and placing candidates with specialized expertise to deliver in-demand skills for important positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates’ workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our Experis brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise or continue. Our Proservia offering within the Experis brand includes outcome-based solutions specializing in infrastructure management and end-user support.
 Our Talent Solutions brand specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and new solutions and creating added value that addresses our clients’ complex global workforce needs. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through exclusive outsourcing contracts. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. Our Right Management offering includes our career management services that have historically been counter-cyclical to our staffing services, which helps to offset the impact of an economic downturn on our overall financial results.
 Americas
 We provide services as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The Americas segment had 481 branch and 182 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021. In the United States, where we realized 62% of the Americas’ revenue, we had 314 branch and 175 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021, as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. This includes business and personnel we added in connection with the ettain group acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico, Canada and Argentina, we had 172 branch offices and 7 franchise offices as of December 31, 2021. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise.
 Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower® service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchisee sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise.
 Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. During 2021 in this segment, approximately 35% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 21% from placing office staff, and 44% from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2021, approximately 41% of the temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 13% from placing office staff, and 46% from placing professional and technical staff.
 Our Talent Solutions operations provide a variety of workforce solutions offerings including RPO, MSP and Right Management.

 We are a leading provider of permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing services throughout Europe. The Southern Europe segment had 1,061 branch offices as of December 31, 2021. Our largest operations in this segment are in France (56% of the segment revenue) and Italy (20% of the segment revenue).
 During 2021 for our Southern Europe operations, approximately 74% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 14% from placing office staff, and 12% from placing professional and technical staff.


We conduct our operations in France as a leading workforce solutions and service provider through 523 branch offices as Manpower, Experis, including our Proservia brand, and Talent Solutions, and 154 branch offices under the name Supplay as of December 31, 2021. The employment services market in France calls for a wide range of our services including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, and training. The temporary recruitment market is predominantly focused on recruitment for industrial positions. In 2021, we derived approximately 85% of our temporary recruitment revenues in France from the supply of industrial and construction workers, 14% from the supply of office staff, and 1% from the supply of professional and technical staff.

In 2021, approximately 67% of our temporary and contract recruitment revenues in Italy were derived from placing industrial staff, 6% from placing office staff, including contact center staff, and 27% from placing professional and technical staff.
 Northern Europe
 Our largest operations in Northern Europe are in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordics and the Netherlands, providing a comprehensive suite of workforce solutions and services through Manpower, Experis, and Talent Solutions. Collectively, we operate through 350 branch offices in this region.
During 2021 for our Northern Europe operations, approximately 37% of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 24% from placing office staff, and 39% from placing professional and technical staff.
 In the United Kingdom, where we have the largest operation in this segment, we are a leading provider of workforce solutions and services. As of December 31, 2021, we conducted operations in the United Kingdom as Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions through a network of 58 branch offices and also provided on-site services to clients who have significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. During 2021, approximately 27% of our United Kingdom operation’s temporary recruitment revenues were derived from the supply of industrial staff, 19% from the supply of office staff, and 54% from the supply of professional and technical staff. In the United Kingdom, we also conduct operations as Brook Street Bureau PLC, or Brook Street. Its core business is secretarial, office and light industrial recruitment. Brook Street operates as a local network of branches and competes primarily with local or regional independents. Brook Street’s revenues are comprised of temporary and contract placements as well as permanent recruitment.
 APME
 We operate through 132 branch offices in the Asia Pacific Middle East (APME) region. The largest of these operations are located in Japan, Australia, India and Korea, all of which operate through branch offices. Our APME operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services offered through Manpower, Experis and Talent Solutions, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection, training and outsourcing. During 2021, approximately 9% of our APME temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 61% from placing office staff, and 30% from placing professional and technical staff.
 On July 10, 2019, our joint venture in Greater China, ManpowerGroup Greater China Limited, became listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited through an initial public offering. As a result, we deconsolidated the joint venture as of the listing date and account for our remaining 36.87% interest under the equity method of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information.)
 

Competition
 We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services.
 Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are The Adecco Group and Randstad. We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings, Kelly Services, Robert Half, Kforce, PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the increasing demand for skilled people, employers’ desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including several of the employment services industry’s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions.
 Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, and large national and multinational client relationships. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses are based on a local or regional relationship, and tend to rely less on longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. The large national and multinational clients, on the other hand, will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to local managers.
As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed.
 Legal Regulations
 The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation:
 •regulation of the employer/employee relationship between the firm and its temporary and contract employees;
 •registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements;
 •substantive limitations on the operations or the use of temporary and contract employees by clients; and
 •regulation that requires new or additional benefits and pay parity for our associates.
 In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us.
 In most countries, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, health and other benefits, anti-discrimination and workers’ compensation, govern the firm.
 In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement.
 In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination.
 

Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subject to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate.
 In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission’s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises.
 Changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which workforce solutions and services firms may operate. These changes could impose additional costs, taxes, record keeping or reporting requirements; restrict the tasks to which contingent workers may be assigned; limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the relationship (with us or the client); or otherwise adversely affect the industry.
 Trademarks
 We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries and territories. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup®, Manpower®, Experis®, Right Management®, Brook Street®, Proservia®, Jefferson Wells®, Supplay® and MyPath® have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future.
Employees
 We had approximately 30,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we recruit millions of permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year on behalf of our clients.
 As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees.
 Human Capital
 
We Are a Workforce Solutions and Human Capital Company.

Our purpose is to provide meaningful and sustainable jobs and is rooted in our values: People, Knowledge and Innovation. Our almost 30,000 employees, spanning 75 countries and territories, help improve the lives of nearly 600,000 workers daily by providing access to employment and opportunities to reskill or upskill. These efforts support local economies and create economic opportunity for our associates. 
We Are Focused on Reskilling and Upskilling Workers and Future Workers.
 Through our partnerships with clients and nongovernmental organizations (e.g. World Economic Forum, World Employment Confederation and Junior Achievement) and our own research and solutions, we are advancing the global discussion around the skills preparedness of today’s workers and the definition of required skills for the future. Since 2016, through our Skills Revolution series, we have highlighted how technology and digitization would shift in-demand skills, exacerbate existing talent shortages, and require investments to reskill and upskill workers.
 In response to these accelerating trends, we launched MyPath, our global associate upskilling program for our Manpower brand, with the intent of connecting our associates to opportunities that can advance their skills and meet employers’ needs. Through this program, ManpowerGroup provides personalized guidance, career development, training and access to jobs especially in growth sectors including advanced manufacturing, information technology, supply chain and customer service. MyPath has impacted 154,000 lives by the end of 2021, and MyPath associates now represent 25% of our associate talent pool in certified markets, across 11,000 clients and 12 countries.
 As part of our plans to become creators of talent at scale, we are also innovating around skills development in Experis, through our investment in Experis Academy and tools such as Career Accelerator for our professional consultants. Our goal is for more companies to turn to us for our expertise in finding, retaining and reskilling diverse talent to enable them to accelerate their digital transformation and execute their business strategies.


We Are Focused on Our Diversity, Our People and Our Culture.
We have a global footprint, though our teams are managed locally: 32% of our people are in the Americas, 30% in Southern Europe, 22% in Northern Europe and 15% in Asia Pacific/Middle East. Collectively, we are focused on advancing diversity, developing our people and assessing our culture to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace and the workplace.
Advancing Diversity
 
Our focus on diversity encompasses four goals: (1) globally, support gender diversity at leadership levels; (2) locally, address a second dimension of diversity based on gaps or opportunities within a country; (3) culturally, foster an inclusive environment that supports our diverse workforce; and (4) societally, advance employment security for workers while promoting upskilling, well-being, flexibility and income opportunity.
 
We believe that diversity starts at the top. We are proud that our Board of Directors has exceeded 30% gender diversity for nearly 10 years, is 17% racially diverse and 33% non-US born. Our Executive Leadership Team, which reports directly to the CEO, is 27% women, 36% racially diverse and 72% non US-born. Our Global Leadership Team, the top 98 leaders in the company, is 33% women.
 
For several of our large markets, including the United States, the second diversity dimension is race and ethnicity. Building upon our Courageous Conversations progress in 2020, more than 200 leaders in our North America team completed our INCLUDE training which was developed by our Business Resource Groups with the support and expertise of our Right Management team during 2021. INCLUDE helps leaders to remove barriers to inclusion in the workplace by helping them to (1) value the unique identity of others, (2) create psychological safety and (3) enable belonging. Additionally, our North American team achieved our current leadership goal of 40% gender diversity ahead of goal by more than one year. This inspired us to expand our goal to 50% gender diversity at the global level by 2025.
 
Developing our People
 
We believe that our future success is contingent upon the development of our next generation of leaders. We are investing in our people to support both our strategic ambitions and their personal goals. In 2021, we continued the expansion and revamping of our leadership development programs, even while the challenges of the pandemic continued. These advancements and investments are intended to develop the capabilities of our leaders at a time when leadership is increasingly complex. Our learning and development programming now includes segments extending to Accelerated Leadership, Strategic Leadership and our Future Leaders high-potential program as well as continued development of our current leaders. On completion of our leadership programs, the majority of participants make positive career moves – 60% after one year and 68% within two years.
 
In 2021, we also increased our focus on learning through investment in the development of our Sales Academies and our Talent Agent program, training more than 3,700 recruiters and over 2,000 salespeople, while curating new online micro-courses for all employees.

Evolving our Culture
 
Through our listening strategy, we are committed to hearing the voice of our people more than ever. We continue to track engagement and leadership effectiveness through our ManpowerGroup Annual People Survey (MAPS) and have seen year over year improvements in both response and overall favorability ratings.
 
In 2021, we launched our Culture Matters initiative. In this initiative, we are focused on corporate culture as an enabler of our strategy. We believe that further enhancing our employees’ engagement will enhance our business performance, will enable us to achieve strategic growth, and will benefit the communities in which we operate. As part of this initiative, we have reaffirmed our core values of People, Knowledge and Innovation, which we believe are important to our workforce. We continue to commit to our PeopleFirst approach, which we believe has been a distinguishing feature of our company since its founding.
