ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation 2 (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a blank check company incorporated on May 25, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. Although there is no restriction or limitation on what industry our target operates in, it is our intention to pursue prospective targets that are focused on healthcare innovation. We anticipate targeting companies domiciled in North America or Europe that are developing assets in the biopharma and medical technology sectors, which aligns with our management team’s experience in healthcare investing and drug development.
Our Sponsor and Competitive Advantages



HSAC 2 Holdings, LLC, our sponsor (the “sponsor”), is an affiliate of RTW Investments, LP, or RTW, a New York based financial firm managing approximately $8.7 billion of regulatory assets under management, as of December 31, 2020. RTW was formed in 2009 by Roderick Wong, MD, and has garnered a reputation as a leading capital provider to healthcare industry entrepreneurs and academic investigators due to its investment expertise, deep industry relationships, benevolent activism, and long-standing track record.



Our management team is led by Dr. Roderick Wong and Dr. Naveen Yalamanchi, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager of RTW, respectively. Drs. Wong and Yalamanchi have more than 31 years of combined experience in healthcare investing. Dr. Wong’s specialization lies within the biopharma area, and Dr. Yalamanchi’s focus lies within the medical technology sector, including, but not limited to, device and diagnostic companies.



We believe that our company’s philosophical alignment with RTW, and our ability to leverage the rigorous and comprehensive scientific and financial analysis that RTW is known for, provides us with a strong competitive advantage. RTW focuses on identifying transformational innovations across the life sciences space, specifically backing scientific programs that have the potential to disrupt the current standard of care in their respective disease areas. RTW’s screening process has been honed by Dr. Wong throughout his over 15-year tenure as an investment management professional.



RTW invests in healthcare companies across the public/private spectrum, supporting investments through multiple stages of their respective life cycles. To date, RTW has not only delivered attractive financial returns to investors but has also successfully supported companies through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval process and the commercialization of six commercially available drugs.



RTW is a full life-cycle investor and, as such, recognizes the importance of providing growth capital along with the support of an experienced team, if and when needed, at any critical inflection point in an asset’s life cycle. RTW has engaged in new company formations around licensing promising programs from both biotechnology companies and academic institutions and pairing these programs with world-class management teams. An example of this is Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rocket, a now publicly traded gene therapy platform company (listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “RCKT”), where Dr. Wong serves as Chairman and Dr. Yalamanchi serves as a director. Rocket has a pipeline of four clinical stage programs and one pre-clinical stage program, each identified through RTW’s proprietary “data-first” screening process.



RTW has long-term trusted relationships it can leverage for investment purposes. Since RTW’s inception, the firm has formed three publicly traded biopharma companies, sponsored a special purpose acquisition company (Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation), and listed a closed-ended fund on the Specialist Fund Segment of the London Stock Exchange that trades under the ticker symbol “RTW”. Since 2015, RTW has met with more than 300 private companies and invested in more than 30 private transactions. The majority of RTW’s private investments since 2015 have been as a lead or participant in financing rounds involving other active and well-connected investors in the biopharma and medical technology sectors, illustrative of the value RTW places on syndicating deals with trusted co-investors whose interest align with maximizing long-term value.





1







RTW’s team is comprised of 60 individuals, over 40% of whom have medical or advanced scientific training and/or legal or investment banking experience, all of which enable a deeply differentiated approach to research, idea generation, and deal execution. Complementing RTW’s outstanding scientific perspicacity and industry relationships is RTW’s business team, whose members bring valuable experiences as a life sciences attorney, industry operators, consultants and investment bankers, who are actively engaging with banks and academic institutions, sophisticated family offices and institutional investors, while cultivating strong relationships and expanding our network of key contacts and syndicate partners. We believe the well-roundedness of the team, strengthened by strong ties across industry, academia, banking platforms, and unaffiliated investor relationships, will enhance our management team’s ability to source viable prospective target businesses, capitalize them, and ensure public-market readiness.



We believe that our management team is equipped with the knowledge, experience, capital and human resources, and sustainable corporate governance practices to pursue unique opportunities that will offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, we know first-hand the burden placed on management teams of healthcare companies while they are simultaneously trying to advance their programs and sell their vision to both investors and the board of directors. We are prepared to shoulder some of this burden upfront, ultimately allowing our business combination partner to focus on creating value.



With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management team or RTW, including with respect to Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation, is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s or RTW’s performance as indicative of our future performance.



Our Experience with Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”)



RTW sponsored Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation’s (Nasdaq: HSAC) $115 million initial public offering in May 2019. In December 2019, HSAC completed its business combination with Immunovant Sciences, Ltd. (“Immunovant”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for patients with autoimmune diseases, and is now publicly listed on Nasdaq as Immunovant, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMVT). HSAC and the subsequent business combination achieved several important milestones. HSAC closed its business combination with Immunovant 216 days after the initial public offering. Moreover, the HSAC-Immunovant SPAC achieved an IRR of 106% for ordinary shares and warrant shareholders from initial public offering to the closing of the business combination. Additionally, the business combination closed with zero redemptions from shareholders. Dr. Wong served as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of HSAC, Dr. Yalamanchi served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and a board member of HSAC, Alice Lee served as Vice President of Operations and as Secretary and Treasurer of HSAC, and Stephanie Sirota served as Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Corporate Communications of HSAC.

Acquisition Strategy



Our acquisition strategy is to identify an untapped opportunity within our target industry and offer a public-ready business a facility through which to enter the public sphere accessing capital markets and advancing its priorities. We believe that our management team’s and directors’ experiences in evaluating assets through investing and company building will enable us to source the highest quality targets. Our selection process will leverage the relationships of our management team with industry captains, leading venture capitalists, private equity and hedge fund managers, respected peers, and our network of investment banking executives, attorneys, and accountants. Together with this network of trusted partners, we intend to capitalize the target business and create purposeful strategic initiatives in order to achieve attractive growth and performance targets.



We will focus on targeting companies in the most innovative subsectors within the broader healthcare complex where emerging technologies in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical technologies are engendering explosive growth in drug development.

Investment Criteria



We intend to focus on companies that possess under-researched and underappreciated asset(s) poised for significant growth once adequately capitalized.



Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies that we believe:

● | have a scientific or other competitive advantage in the markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek target companies that have significant competitive advantages and underexploited expansion opportunities that can benefit from access to additional capital as well as our industry relationships and expertise.




● | are ready to be public, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place; ’
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We will seek to identify companies with strong and experienced public-ready management teams. Specifically, we will look for management teams that have a proven track record of value creation for their shareholders. We will seek to partner with a potential target’s management team and expect that the operating and investment abilities of our executive team and board will complement their own capabilities.




● | will likely be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses with appropriate valuations that can benefit from a public listing and new capital for growth to support significant revenue and earnings growth or to advance clinical programs.




● | have significant embedded and/or underexploited growth opportunities of which our team is uniquely positioned to identify and monetize;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek target companies that have significant and underexploited expansion opportunities. This can be accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets. Our management team has significant experience in identifying such targets and in helping target management assess the strategic and financial fit. Similarly, our management has the expertise to assess the likely synergies and a process to help a target integrate acquisitions.




● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We will seek target companies which exhibit value or other characteristics that we believe have been overlooked or misevaluated by the marketplace based on our company-specific analyses and due diligence. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of current or future earnings, preclinical or clinical data, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, and material contracts. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.




● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverage our experience. We expect to evaluate a company based on its potential to successfully achieve regulatory approval and commercialize its product(s). We also expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) risk-adjusted peak sales potential, (ii) the growth potential of pipeline products and the scientific platform, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth via other options, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions, and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other initiatives. Potential upside, for example, from the growth in the target business’s earnings or an improved capital structure, will be weighed against any identified downside risks.

Competitive Strengths



We believe our competitive strengths to be the following:



Status as a public company



We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for shares of our shares or for a combination of shares of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our requirements to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination and provide holders of public shares the opportunity to convert their shares into cash from the trust account, as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.



Transaction flexibility



We offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for shares, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and it may not be available to us. 



Competitive Weaknesses



We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:



Limited financial resources



Our financial reserves are relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct.



Limited technical and human resources



As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.





6







Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer



We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we complete a business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering, our shares, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses



We believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous business combination candidates. We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions or mergers in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. Except for the $10,000 per month administrative services fee paid to our sponsor, in no event will our initial shareholders or any of the members of our management team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our initial shareholders or director nominees. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



Subject to our management team’s fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Therefore, the fair market value of the target business will be calculated prior to any conversions of our shares in connection with a business combination and therefore will be a minimum of $128,000,000 in order to satisfy the 80% test. While the fair market value of the target business must satisfy the 80% test, the consideration we pay the owners of the target business may be a combination of cash (whether cash from the trust account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business combination) or our equity securities. The exact nature and amount of consideration would be determined based on negotiations with the target business, although we will attempt to primarily use our equity as transaction consideration. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses.





7







To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


● | return on equity or invested capital;
--+--------------------------------------


● | market capitalization or enterprise value;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business. The retention of our officers and directors following the completion of any business combination will not be a material consideration in our evaluation of a prospective target business.





8







Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. Therefore, the fair market value of the target business will be calculated prior to any conversions of our shares in connection with a business combination and therefore will be a minimum of $128,000,000 in order to satisfy the 80% test. While the fair market value of the target business must satisfy the 80% test, the consideration we pay the owners of the target business may be a combination of cash (whether cash from the trust account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business combination) or our equity securities. The exact nature and amount of consideration would be determined based on negotiations with the target business, although we will attempt to primarily use our equity as transaction consideration. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will also obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm before consummating a business combination with an entity affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial shareholders. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund-raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or other initial shareholders and are therefore required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view, we may ask that banking firm to opine on whether the target business met the 80% fair market value test. Nevertheless, we are not required to do so and could determine not to do so without consent of our shareholders.

Lack of Business Diversification



We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail simultaneous business combinations with several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously consummate our initial business combination with several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With a business combination with several businesses, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the target companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management Team



Although we intend to scrutinize the management team of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination, our assessment of the target business’ management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our ordinary shares for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.





10







Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholder Approval of Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company will be required to approve the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait August 6, 2022 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as little as 632,501 of our public shares (or approximately 4.0% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved.



If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will provide our shareholders with an opportunity to tender their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. 





11







In the event we allow shareholders to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules, our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not purchase public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.



If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or Nasdaq requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:




● | permit shareholders to convert their shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide shareholders with the conversion rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.



We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company will be required to approve the business combination. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third-party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait August 6, 2022 in order to be able to receive a portion of the trust account.



Our initial shareholders, including our officers and directors, have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares into the right to receive cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (3) not to sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



Depending on how a business combination was structured, any shareholder approval requirement could be satisfied by obtaining the approval of either (i) a majority of the ordinary shares that were voted at the general meeting (assuming a quorum was present at the general meeting), or (ii) a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares. Because our initial shareholders, including our officers and directors, collectively beneficially own approximately 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, a minimum of approximately 632,501 public shares, or 4.0% of the outstanding ordinary shares, would need to be voted in favor a business combination in order for it to be approved.





12







None of our initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase ordinary shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we seek shareholder approval of a business combination and if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, we or our initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. No funds from the trust account can be released from the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination to make such purchases (although such purchases could be made using funds available to us after the closing of a business combination). We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or our initial shareholders or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Sections 9(a)(2) or 10(b) of the Exchange Act or Regulation M, which are rules that prohibit manipulation of a company’s stock, shares or other equity interests, and we and they will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act in connection with any open-market purchases. If purchases cannot be made without violating applicable law, no such purchases will be made. The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our ordinary shares may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our ordinary shares on a national securities exchange. Our initial shareholders anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our initial shareholders or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our initial shareholders or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination.



Conversion/Tender Rights



At any general meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.



Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.



Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly.





13







We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any general meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our ordinary shares when they otherwise would not want to.



There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any request to convert or tender such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his, her or its certificate in connection with an election of his, her or its conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he, she or it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



If we do not complete a business combination by August 6, 2022, it will trigger our automatic winding up, liquidation and dissolution pursuant to the terms of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, liquidation and dissolution. At such time, the private warrants will expire and our sponsor will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such private warrants, and the private warrants will be worthless.



The amount in the trust account (less approximately $1,600 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Law, provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.





14







Each of our initial shareholders and our sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private shares and to vote their insider shares and private shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our private warrants, which will expire worthless.



If we do not complete an initial business combination and expend all of the proceeds of our initial public offering other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.00.



The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.



Our sponsor, HSAC 2 Holdings, LLC, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that our sponsor will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.00 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.00 per ordinary share.



Potential Revisions to Agreements with our Initial Shareholders



Each of our initial shareholders has entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which each of them has agreed to do certain things relating to us and our activities prior to a business combination. We could seek to amend these letter agreements without the approval of shareholders, although we have no intention to do so. In particular:

● | Restrictions relating to liquidating the trust account if we failed to consummate a business combination in the time frames specified above could be amended, but only if we allowed all shareholders to redeem their shares in connection with such amendment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restrictions relating to our initial shareholders being required to vote in favor of a business combination or against any amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow our initial shareholders to vote on a transaction as they wished;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






15








● | The requirement of members of the management team to remain our officer or director until the closing of a business combination could be amended to allow persons to resign from their positions with us if, for example, the current management team was having difficulty locating a target business and another management team had a potential target business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The restrictions on transfer of our ordinary shares could be amended to allow transfer to third parties who were not members of our original management team;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The obligation of our management team to not propose amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow them to propose such changes to our shareholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The obligation of our initial shareholders to not receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified in order to allow them to receive such compensation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement to obtain a valuation for any target business affiliated with our initial shareholders, in the event it was too expensive to do so.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Except as specified above, shareholders would not be required to be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes. Such changes could result in:




● | Our initial shareholders being able to vote against a business combination or in favor of changes to our organizational documents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our operations being controlled by a new management team that our shareholders did not elect to invest with;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our initial shareholders receiving compensation in connection with a business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our initial shareholders closing a transaction with one of their affiliates without receiving an independent valuation of such business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We will not agree to any such changes unless we believed that such changes were in the best interests of our shareholders (for example, if we believed such a modification were necessary to complete a business combination). Each of our officers and directors has fiduciary obligations to us requiring that he or she act in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders.



Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information



We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.





16







We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding private warrants and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial business combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.

Employees



We have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial business combination with has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
