Item 1. - Business
The Company 
     Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. Our history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the USA. Today, we are a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Our innovation excellence and global packaging expertise enables us to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional, appealing, and cost effective for our customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.
Sustainability
    Sustainability is central to our business and one of our most exciting opportunities for growth. Working daily to embed sustainability deeper into everything we do, Amcor has been a leader in the industry in promoting sustainability. We aspire to improve the quality of lives, protect ecosystems, and preserve natural resources for future generations by offering a unique range of responsible packaging solutions, leveraging our global scale, reach, and expertise to meet our customers’ growing sustainability expectations. In January 2018, we became the world’s first packaging company to pledge that all our packaging would be designed to be recycled, compostable, or reusable by 2025 and also committed to increasing the amount of recycled content we use. We are delivering against these commitments and continue to lead in the development of a responsible packaging value chain through our innovations and partnerships. We have identified a clear path to meeting our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers by focusing on the three elements of responsible packaging – product innovation, consumer participation, and infrastructure development.
Differentiated Solutions
    Our product portfolio is diverse and dynamic due to our constant innovation and close partnerships with our customers. Behind every one of our products stands a unique combination of technical know-how, business experience, and expertise. We work closely with our customers to identify feasible, high-performance, responsible packaging solutions based on their unique needs. Where solutions do not currently exist, we work to innovate new ones. We invest approximately $100 million every year in our industry-leading research and development capabilities, bringing together the best in packaging design, science, manufacturing, and people. 
Expertise across Packaging Materials 
    We believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer a variety of packaging solutions with a wide, differentiated portfolio of products. Our packaging expertise covers all main packaging materials including paper, metal, plastic, recycled, and bio-based materials and the sustainable use of recyclable plastics. Our expertise and track record translate across many innovative solutions that customers can explore with ease and convenience to meet their growing packaging needs, while improving environmental impact.
Business Strategy
Strategy
    Our business strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders, and the environment.
Focused portfolio
    Our portfolio of businesses share certain important characteristics:
•A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•good industry structure,
•attractive relative growth, and
•multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position, scale, and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation.
    These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
    "The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline. Our values of Safety, Integrity, Collaboration, Accountability, and Results and Outperformance guide our behavior, driving our winning aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company.
Shareholder value creation
    Through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders. The nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets means that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time, value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.
Segment Information
    Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, we have determined we have two reportable segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reportable segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 21, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments.
Flexibles Segment
    Our Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 37,000 employees at 169 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2022, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum, and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2022, Flexibles accounted for approximately 77% of consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
    Our Rigid Packaging Segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2022, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 52 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2022, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 23% of consolidated net sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
    Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and customer service teams. 
    We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years.
    The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company, and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies. 
    We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. 
Backlog
    Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the markets in which we operate.
Raw Materials
    Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While persistent industry-wide shortages of certain raw materials have continued to occur since the second half of fiscal 2021, we have been able to manage supply disruptions with no material impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages can lead and have in the past led to increased raw material price volatility. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time and other means. We expect supply disruption and price volatility to continue into fiscal year 2023 and will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize the impact on our operations.
Intellectual Property
    We are the owner or licensee of more than a thousand United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms, or otherwise.
Sustainability and Innovation
    We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food, beverages, and healthcare products, protect consumers, and promote brands. Consumers also want cost effective, convenient, and easy to use packaging with a reduced environmental footprint and a responsible end of life solution. We have identified a clear path to provide food, beverages, and healthcare products to people around the world in a more sustainable way, and meet our sustainability ambitions, and those of our customers by focusing on what we believe are the three elements of responsible packaging: product innovation, consumer participation, and infrastructure development. We believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success. Our responsible packaging solutions address both how the product is made, as well as what happens after the consumer uses it, offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers’ specific packaging needs. Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from the investments we are making in sustainable packaging innovation and design, to the partnerships we enter, and to how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently. 
    Innovation is central to Amcor’s approach to sustainability and we spend approximately $100 million a year on research and development. We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and have more than a thousand active patents. We solve packaging challenges, developing differentiated products, services, and processes to protect our customers products and fulfil the needs of the consumers who rely on them around the globe. Drawing on unrivaled heritage in design, science and manufacturing, our more than 1,000 research and development ("R&D") professionals and engineers are constantly innovating new materials, formats, and technologies.
    We collaborate with like-minded partners, including customers and suppliers, in pursuit of innovative solutions to address some of the world’s most urgent challenges, including increasing recycling and reuse and protecting our planet. We also partner with non-governmental organizations, promising startups, and cross-industry initiatives and bodies. These partnerships enable us to learn, experience other perspectives, share our expertise, and expand our innovation. With our partners, we advocate for sound global standards, better waste management infrastructure, and more consumer participation.
    We consider our overall environmental footprint to go well beyond the products we create. We also strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations and, for more than a decade, our EnviroAction program has helped us significantly improve how we manage energy, water, and waste in every one of our locations. In January 2022, we further increased our efforts by committing to science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. These new commitments have been recognized by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and build on years of progress under our EnviroAction program. Through our unique material science and innovation capabilities, we also advise our customers on the best solutions for their specific needs and those of their consumers – with broad flexibility across packaging functionality, formats, and materials.
    With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging, and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor.
Governmental Laws and Regulations
    Our operations and the real property we own, or lease, are subject to broad governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to employee health and safety, the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources, and other government regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations based on the execution of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not, in the future, incur liability with respect to noncompliance with health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or 
operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, or other broad government regulations which could be significant. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 20, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Seasonal Factors 
    The business of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
    Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies.
Human Capital Management
Overview
    Amcor’s aspiration is to be ‘THE leading global packaging company'. Our people are core to the achievement of our aspiration. We believe we are winning for our people when they feel safe, engaged, and are developing as part of a high-performing, global team. We strive to build an outperformance culture in which we consistently deliver results and strive to surpass expectations. At Amcor, we are stronger because of the diverse strengths, styles, cultures, and experiences of our people. We aim to create inclusive working environments to ensure each colleague feels valued, treated with respect, encouraged to speak, and empowered to be their best.
    As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 44,000 employees, including part-time and temporary workers, worldwide, with approximately 30% located in North America, 30% located in Europe, 20% located in Latin America, and 20% located in the Asia Pacific region. Collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 46% of our workforce. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 6% of our employees were working under expired contracts and approximately 21% were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year. 
Health and Safety
    Safety is a core value at Amcor. We take care of ourselves and each other, so everyone returns home safely every day. Across every level of our organization, we role model and recognize safe and responsible behavior as we strive to achieve an injury-free Amcor. All our facilities abide by global Environment, Health, and Safety ("EHS") standards for safety and environmental management. Our Board of Directors receives monthly reports on safety performance and compliance with our global EHS standards. During fiscal year 2022, we reduced the number of injuries by 3% and 57% of our sites were injury free. 
    Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates our commitment to the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we work. We implemented rigorous protocols supported by precautionary measures in each of our manufacturing and office locations globally to help ensure the health and safety of our people. 
    As we emerge from the pandemic and continue to focus on the health of our employees, we have worked diligently to provide a compelling workplace for them to return to while recognizing and accommodating the need for flexibility. 
Developing Talent
    At Amcor, we are dedicated to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best talent to deliver our 'Winning Aspiration' and ensure a strong succession pipeline for the future. 
    Our approach to talent is guided by the understanding that differentiated, industry-leading talent deployed consistently across our business will enable Amcor’s success. 
    We deploy systems and processes to ensure our people have clear goals and are empowered to achieve them. Through performance management, we align these goals to business targets, providing line of sight so each employee understands how they contribute to our success. Through formal reviews, performance coaching, and feedback, our leaders implement a rigorous cycle to foster talent.
Learning & Development
    We have implemented training and education programs to help our employees progress across functions and experience levels. Examples of these programs include a Leading to Outperform program ("LTO") to further advance high-potential talent, a Senior Leader Development program ("SLDP") focusing on developing strategic management skills and inclusive leadership, and an Executive Development program ("EDP") for our most senior leaders. In each of these programs we partner with leading academic and executive education institutions from around the world.
    Recognizing the importance of the learning journey, our employees can also access our "Masterclass" program which delivers an annual series of executive education briefings on topics of functional excellence and business initiatives. Our focus this year has been on Accelerating Growth with showcase presentations from Marketing, R&D, Product Branding, and Innovation Leaders.
    Our "JumpStart@Amcor" global program accelerates onboarding of new employees and provides an avenue for cross-functional learning. We also run an Accelerated Career Development program ("ACDP") which provides a global intake on new talent with a structured rotation to develop commercial capabilities and an enhanced global commercial talent pipeline.
Diversity & Inclusion
    At Amcor, we’re committed to providing an inclusive environment that empowers us to achieve our full potential. Becoming THE leading global packaging company requires us to create a culture in which everyone feels encouraged to speak and compelled to listen. 
    Amcor is stronger as a result of the diverse talents, styles, cultures, and experiences of our people. With different perspectives come different solutions that enable us to win for our stakeholders. We are one global team in which everyone has a voice and can make a difference. With this in mind, we work to create a team environment that develops inclusive leaders, where we learn from our people, and where listening, trust, and respect are key behaviors that form the foundation of our interactions and foster mutual understanding. 
    We focus on strengthening 'talent through diversity' and progress is reported to our Board annually. We continually review opportunities to strengthen our diversity transparency practices while adhering to privacy legislation in certain regions where we operate.
Engagement
    During fiscal year 2022, we completed our fifth global engagement survey. Titled "OurVoice@Amcor", the survey tracks the engagement of our employees across multiple dimensions and provides a benchmark against other global manufacturing companies. In the recent 2022 survey, we received feedback from over 30,000 Amcor employees from every country and business group. The dominant feedback was that colleagues feel Amcor is a great place to work and that they want more communication with leadership about the direction and future strategies of the Company. Action plans are underway across the organization to provide feedback loops and implement action plans.
Ethics
    Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our aspirations. Our employees are expected to act with integrity and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance. 
    We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy which is signed by every Amcor employee and provides the Company's framework for making ethical business decisions. We provide targeted training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive adherence to the national laws in each country in which we operate.
