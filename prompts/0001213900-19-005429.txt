Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We strive to become a one-stop shop that focuses on lending service for micro, small-to-medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) in China. We are primarily engaged in the business of microfinancing services. We operate our direct microfinancing business through our subsidiary, Arki E-Commerce, and our VIE, Arki Network. With the increased difficulty of obtaining sufficient financing through traditional channels by SMEs, we offer SMEs alternative financing means through risk-controlled private lending to meet their capital needs and develop their business. We offer advisory and risk assessment services to both lenders and borrowers to help increase the efficiency of loan origination by financial institutions. It is our belief that the growth of SMEs will become an important factor of China’s economic growth in the next decade. We believe that our expertise in streamlining microfinancing process will place our company in a unique position in the marketplace.
 
On December 31, 2015, we issued 1,357,300 shares of common stock pursuant to a Regulation S offering for an aggregate offering price of $3,382,500. Also on July 28, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 825,180 shares of the common stock pursuant to another Regulation S offering for an aggregate proceeds of $1,790,640. From these offerings, we raised approximately $5.3 million, approximately $1.5 million were contributed to Consumer Capital DE for working capital needs and approximately $3.7 million were contributed to America Arki Network Service Beijing Co., Ltd. for its microfinancing business.
 
Our Business
 
Microfinancing
 
 Currently, we engage in microfinancing business through our subsidiary, Arki E-Commerce and our VIE, Arki Network, to provide direct loans to SMEs and sole proprietors based in Liaoning Province. We do not lend to individuals. Through Arki Network’s collaboration with China UnionPay Merchant Service (Liaoning) Co. Ltd (“UnionPay Liaoning”), Arki E-Commerce provides private loans for borrowers and Arki Network and UnionPay act as intermediaries to facilitate the loan transactions for an aggregate of 5% service fees. Arki E-Commerce’s practice of microfinancing has been limited to certain businesses, primarily automobile dealerships in China, and a limited number of sole proprietors pre-screened and recommended by UnionPay Liaoning based on historical sales volume generated through credit card transactions using UnionPay’s system. 
 
 We believe that UnionPay Liaoning is incentivized to recommend as many borrowers to us as possible because the potential for additional service fee is a source of revenue for their operation. In China the UnionPay cards are directly connected to the related bank accounts of the end user. The limit of the card is the balance of the related bank accounts. We have a contractual arrangement with UnionPay to provide us with such information and related due diligence information on car dealers and their customers. 
 
 The nature of the UnionPay bank card is similar to a checking account that are widely used in the United States. 
 
 Therefore consumers in China purchase cars using their UnionPay bank cards, not credit cards and through our relationships with UnionPay we can undertake due diligence on the car purchasers which assist us in analyzing the volume and credit worthiness of the car dealers to whom we are making loans. 
 
 Once a business owner submits his/her/its loan application to us, along with a recommendation letter provided by UnionPay Liaoning, Arki Network’s loan servicing team conducts additional due diligence on the quality of the borrowers. The loan servicing team first makes sure that the business is duly incorporated and in good standing with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. The servicing team will then check business’s credit history based on public records provided by the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. The servicing team will also check business’s history with local tax authority to ensure that it does not have any outstanding tax liability. Lastly, the servicing team will conduct phone or in-person interview with the applicant to verify all necessary information. In certain instance, the servicing team may conduct arbitrary on-site visit to the business to assess the validity of the business. Upon completion of the background check by Arki Network’s servicing team, Arki E-Commerce provides short-term loans in the form of original issue discount (“OID Loans”) to qualified borrowers with pre-set interest rate, terms and conditions. Generally, the loan is made less upfront fees and payment of interest, and therefore we deem these loans original discount loans. While Arki E-Commerce collects the interest generated through these loans, Arki Network generates revenue through a one-time 3% service fee while UnionPay Liaoning collects an additional 2% service fee based on the loan amount. With the exception of three companies for which we granted loans in the principal amount of RMB 1,000,000, we generally provide loans to businesses with annual revenue of at least RMB 2,000,000 (approximately US$285,714) with the following terms in order to lower default risk by the borrowers: 
 

● | Principal loan amount: RMB 300,000
--+-----------------------------------

 
1

 


● | Term: 3-6 months 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Security interest is not required 
● | Interest: 1% per month (in the form of original issue discount) 
● | Principal amount to be paid in equal monthly tranches with the first payment due at the end of the 1st month

 
We granted the three larger loans outside of our general practice due our interest in diversifying our loan portfolio and testing out markets’ demand for such products. We haven’t got any bad debt in the past year. And we increased the loan amount on a case by case basis.
 
 Once the loan application is approved by Arki Network, Arki E-Commerce provides funding for the loan to Arki Network, which in turn transfer the funding, net of its service fee, to UnionPay Liaoning, which will wire the loan funds after deducing its service fee to borrower’s bank account stored in its system, which is the same account the borrower uses for receivables from its credit card transactions with UnionPay Lianoning. Once payments are due from the borrower, the borrower will send each tranche of repayment directly to Arki Network through Unionpay’s payment processing system and Arki Network will transfer the repayment back to Arki E-Commerce. Neither UnionPay nor Arki Network charges any service fee to process the repayments. 
 
Because there are many SMEs throughout China, we believe that our microfinancing model offers substantial market potential and intend to devote additional resources to apply the business model in other regions throughout China.
 
Wealth Management
 
 Arki Network through its 51%-owned subsidiary, America Arki (Tianjin) Capital Management Partnership (“Arki Capital”), engages wealth management business. In essence, this “wealth management” business has provided a source funds used to make loans to the SME businesses. Arki Capital operates its business on its financial advisory platform “Bangnitou”, which translates to “Help You Invest” in English and attracts capital from investors to invest in fixed income opportunities such as inter-bank loans, currency exchange products and other equity investment opportunities to help investor obtain return on their investment. Among the potential investment opportunities are the car dealership related loans that are made through Arki commerce and Arki Capital. Still at its development stage, Bangnitou will have a number of financial products that aims to generate annual return ranging from 8-12%. The platform will allow retail investors to invest in products for as little as RMB 100 (or approximately US$15). Once each product reaches its maximum subscription or the end of its offering period, the investments are held for a period of time before being redeemable by the investors, along with the return. As of December 31, 2017, Arki Capital has loan payable amount of RMB 26,670,000 (approximately $4,099,315). RMB7,760,000 (Approximately 1,192,751) carry a one year term, and RMB18,910,000 carry a two year term without interest. Upon redemption date, the investors may demand back the funding or stay on as a limited partner. As of December 31, 2017, Arki Capital owns 750,000 shares of the Company’s stock. Arki Capital has not sold any of the stock in the past year and therefore not generated any revenue. 
 
 Our subsidiaries in the PRC (primarily Arki Capital) obtain loans from lenders/investors in the Bangnitou “wealth management” business. Arki receives the loan funds and allows investors two options regarding repayment. In alternative A, investors may elect to get the principal together with the interest at the end of the investment period (other than the prepaid interest amount). No other interest is paid during the loan period. In alternative B, the investors may elect to receive repayment through shares of the Company’s common stock at a pre-determined conversion rate. Interest, other than prepaid interest, is payable at the end of the loan term, either in cash or in additional shares of our common stock. Any shares of the Company that may be issued as part of this wealth management loan repayment are shares previously obtained by Arki Capital from a third-party non-affiliate shareholder. This business is not conducted in the United States. 
 
We expect Arki Capital to derive substantially all of its revenues from the return generated by the performance of the underlying investment products. It would keep all return in excess of the return that is marketed to the retail investors for the product.

Ceased Businesses
 
On December 23, 2014, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Shanghai Zhonghui Financial Information Services Corp. (“Shanghai Zhonghui”), a PRC peer-to-peer lending company (the “Zhonghui Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the term of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to issue 5,000,000 shares of common stock to certain individuals affiliated with Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Zhonghui Affiliates”), valued at $1.00 per share for a total of $5,000,000 or approximately 31,000,000 RMB, to exchange 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai Zhonghui. As incentive for the closing of the Acquisition, we also agreed to issue to the Affiliates 5,000,000 additional shares of our common stock. Through the acquisition, we engaged in peer-to-peer lending. On December 28, 2016, upon approval by the majority shareholder and Board of Directors of the Company and Arki Network, Arki Network entered into certain business sale agreement with Yanbian YaoTian Gas Group Co., Ltd, a company organized under the laws of the PRC whereby Arki Network sold all of its interest in Shanghai Zhonghui for no consideration. In connection with the sale, Zhonghui Affiliates agreed to cancel 5,000,000 shares of our common stock obtained from the transaction. We have since ceased our peer-to-peer lending business.
 
On November 29, 2010, our wholly-owned subsidiary CCG California received approval from the Beijing Fangshan District Business Council in the PRC to acquire the controlling interest of Beitun Trading Co. Ltd. (“Beitun Trading”), a PRC trading and distribution company. Beitun Trading had a registered capital of RMB500,000 (approximately $80,250), of which RMB255,000 (approximately $40,928) was contributed by CCG and RMB245,000 (approximately $39,323) was contributed by Wei Guo. Effectively, CCG had control of 51% of Beitun Trading, and Wei Guo owned 49% of Beitun Trading. Through Beitun Trading, we engaged in the wholesale distribution of various food and meat products. On April 1, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our 51% interest in Beitun Trading to Zhang Yifan in exchange for cash payment of RMB 255,000 ($41,030). We have since ceased our distribution business.
 
Business Strategy
 
We plan to implement two primary strategies to expand our market presence within the industry: (i) increase Arki E-Commerce’s lending capacity through the cash generated from operations and capital raised from offering; and (ii) expand the Company’s geographic coverage for both microfinancing and wealth management business to major metropolitan areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou through the establishment of sales force. We believe that we can experience significant growth in these areas because there is a large number of established SMEs and sole proprietors in need of capital resources but lack the ability to finance either due to their limited size of business or local banks’ preferences to finance bigger and more established companies. In addition, we believe that our wealth management business will be able to provide potential investors a more attractive return comparing to traditional investment products.

Competitive Strengths
 
Although we operate in a highly-competitive industry, we believe that the following factors provide us with the competitive advantage in the marketplace that could differentiate us from our potential competitors:

● | Strong Relationships with Local Financial Institutions. We have developed strong relationships with local financial institutions. For our microfinancing business, we only provide financing to clients that have been pre-screened by the credit card processing companies such as UnionPay, who and Arki Network would then charge a service fee based on the loan amount. The additional stream of revenue incentivizes UnionPay to promote our services and provide us with potential lending opportunities. It is through leveraging this relationship with large financial institutions such as UnionPay that we believe we are able to provide a unique value-added service to our clients and will be able to grow our client base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Experienced and committed leadership. Our CEO, Mr. Jianmin Gao, has had extensive experience in the banking industry prior to founding our company. Mr. Gao’s experience has provided our company with the skills and expertise that are essential in approaching and selecting appropriate banks, dealing with bank personnel, identifying and evaluating appropriate financial products and services, structuring tailored financial solutions and bargaining with banks on behalf of our clients. In addition, Mr. Gao also has extensive experience working with SMEs. We believe the experience and resources that Mr. Gao can offer will help our company become a more active player in the industry. 
● | Substantial potential client base. Our microfinancing clients are provided by the Liaoning provincial branch of UnionPay. Almost all businesses of various sizes use UnionPay as their primary credit card payment processor within China. Our collaboration with UnionPay therefore places us in a unique position, as UnionPay’s large portfolio of users could provide us with lending opportunities on a mass scale. As our business grows, we believe the existing clients will also continue to be a referral source of our business. 

Corporate History and Organization
 
We were originally incorporated under the name “Mondas Minerals Corp.” in Delaware on April 25, 2008 and were engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of natural resource properties. The principal executive offices were previously located at 13983 West Stone Avenue, Post Falls, ID 83854.
 
We received our initial funding of $15,000 through the sale of common stock to our officer and director who purchased 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at $0.01 per share on May 13, 2008. In January 2010, we raised $1,457,818 from an offering of 1,000,000 shares pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC under file number 333-152330, which became effective on January 5, 2010. The offering was completed on January 27, 2010.
 
We were an exploration stage company with no revenues or operating history prior to our merger on February 4, 2011 described below. We owned a 100% undivided interest in a mineral property, the Ram 1-4 Mineral Claims (known as the “Ram Property.”) The Ram Property consists of an area of 82.64 acres located in the Lida Quadrangle Area, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Title to the Ram Property was held by Mondas. Our plan of operation was to conduct mineral exploration activities on the property in order to assess whether it contains mineral deposits capable of commercial extraction.
 
As of December 31, 2010 and immediately prior to the merger transaction described below, we were an exploration stage company with nominal assets, no revenues, or operating history. On January 11, 2011, we changed our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.

On February 4, 2011, we acquired Consumer Capital Group, Inc., a California corporation (“CCG California”), a consumer e-commerce business with operations in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) in a reverse merger transaction (the “Merger”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) by and among [ys,] our wholly owned subsidiary CCG Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“CCG Delaware”), CCG California, and Scott D. Bengfort.
 
In the Merger, CCG Delaware merged into CCG California with CCG California as the surviving corporation. As a result, CCG California became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the subsidiaries of CCG Delaware including America Pine (Beijing) Bio-Tech, Inc. (“American Pine”), Arki (Beijing) E-Commerce Technology Corp. (“Arki E-Commerce”), Beijing Beitun Trading Co., Ltd. (since disposed in 2014), and America Arki (Fuxin) Network Management Co. Ltd. (“American Arki”), all of which are incorporated in China (together, the “PRC Subsidiaries”), became Mondas’s indirect subsidiaries. Arki E-Commerce and America Arki have a contractual relationship with America Arki Network Service Beijing Co., Ltd. (“Arki Network”), a PRC limited liability company, which is 100% owned by two of CCG California’s former major shareholders and officers. CCG California, the PRC Subsidiaries, and Arki Network are collectively referred to as the “CCG Group.”
 
On January 7, 2011, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary by the name of “Consumer Capital Group Inc.” (“CCG Name Sub”) in Delaware solely for purposes of changing its corporate name to “Consumer Capital Group Inc.” in conjunction with the closing of the Merger. On February 17, 2011, we changed our name to Consumer Capital Group Inc. Pursuant to Certificate of Ownership filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware by merging CCG Name Sub into our company with our company surviving and CCG Name Sub ceasing to exist.
 
Under the Merger Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 17,777,778 shares of common stock to the shareholders of CCG California immediately prior to the Merger (“CCG Shareholders”) at an exchange rate of one (1) share of our common stock for each 21.96 shares of CCG California common stock.
 
Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, there were 2,500,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, 60% of which were held by the then-principal stockholder, CEO, and sole director of [the our] company, Mr. Bengfort. As a part of the Merger, CCG California paid USD $335,000 in cash to Mr. Bengfort in exchange for his agreement to enter into various transaction agreements relating to the Merger, as well as the cancellation of 1,388,889 shares of common stock directly held by him, constituting 92.6% of his pre-Merger holdings of our common stock. 
 
In connection with the Merger, our mining rights were assigned to Mr. Bengfort, and in turn, Mr. Bengfort personally assumed all liabilities of our company existing immediately prior to the closing, under the terms of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement between our company and Mr. Bengfort effective on the closing date of the Merger (the “Assignment and Assumption Agreement”). Mr. Bengfort also agreed to discharge and forego his rights to be repaid approximately $16,000, which we owed to him immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, along with all other claims against us, by executing a release agreement (“Release”) effective on the closing date of the Merger. Mr. Bengfort also agreed to be a party to the Merger Agreement, including various representations and warranties. Further, Mr. Bengfort executed an indemnification agreement (“Indemnification Agreement”) in favor of CCG California and its shareholders to indemnify them for any breach of the Merger Agreement or unpaid or unresolved liabilities of our company that may materialize within a one year period after the closing. The closing of the Merger was on February 4, 2011.
 
In connection with the closing, Mr. Bengfort resigned from his role as our sole officer and director. New directors took office, and appointed new officers promptly following the closing of the Merger.
 
On December 1, 2016, Arki Network, a variable interest entity of the Company, entered into certain share exchange agreement with Yin Hang Financial Information Service (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., a company established under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“Yin Hang”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of Yin Hang in exchange for the issuance of 4,680,000 shares of Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to Yin Hang’s shareholders, to be issued upon completion of audit of Yin Hang.
 
On August 31, 2017, Arki Network and Yin Hang entered into a Supplementary Agreement and mutually agreed to terminate the share exchange agreement, effective immediately, because companies in the financial information industry are not permitted to be controlled by foreign companies outside of China. As a result of the termination, Yin Hang was no longer consolidated in the Company’s financial statements as of September 1, 2017.

On November 17, 2017, Arki Network, Beijing Shenzhou Rongtong Investment Management Co. Ltd. (“Shenzhou Rongtong”), a company organized under the law of People’s Republic of China, and all the shareholders of Shenzhou Rongtong entered into an equity transfer agreement, pursuant to which Arki Network agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Shenzhou Rongtong from its shareholders, in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 4,175,417 shares of common stock of the Company, to the shareholders of Shenzhou Rongtong within 15 days of the closing of the transaction. In connection with the transaction, the Company also paid for consulting related services of a consultant, which services were paid for through the issuance of 824,583 shares of Common Stock. The transaction failed to go through as at December 31, 2017 and consulting services were not provided and all of the shares were returned and cancelled.
 
On March 29, 2018, the parties mutually terminated the Agreement through a termination agreement dated March 29, 2018 between Arki Network and Shenzhou Rongtong. According to the termination agreement, the shareholders of Shenzhou Rongtong returned to the Company 4,175,417 shares of common stock of the Company, and the Company returned all of Shenzhou Rongtong’s issued and outstanding equity securities to the shareholders of Shenzhou Rongtong.
 
Changes of Business
 
E-Commerce Business
 
The founders of the CCG Group formed America Pine California in California on November 27, 2006. America Pine was in the business of selling healthcare products imported from the United States of America to residents in the PRC via internet. The founders formed America Pine in the PRC on March 21, 2007 as a wholly owned subsidiary of America Pine California to conduct operations for this business in the PRC. These operations ceased on February 5, 2010.
 
The founders formed Arki E-Commerce in the PRC on March 6, 2008 as a wholly owned subsidiary of America Pine California with an intention to develop the CCG Group’s consumer e-commerce business.
 
On February 5, 2010, in connection with the execution of a Stock Right Transfer Agreement, America Pine California transferred all of its equity interests in both Arki E-Commerce and America Pine to CCG California, which was formed in California on October 14, 2009.
 
On November 26, 2010, CCG California formed America Arki, a PRC WFOE, as its wholly owned subsidiary.
 
On November 26, 2010, Arki E-Commerce, Arki Network, and Arki Network’s shareholders entered into contractual arrangements, and on December 2010, America Arki, Arki E-Commerce, and Arki Network shareholders entered into contractual arrangements, to operate Company’s consumer e-commerce website. Arki Network is owned by CCG’s two largest shareholders, Mr. Jianmin Gao and Mr. Fei Gao. These arrangements are more fully described below under “Corporate Structure.” Because of the lack of sales generated on our online retail platforms, we ceased our E-commerce business in first quarter of 2015.
 
Distribution Business
 
On November 29, 2010, CCG California received approval from the Beijing Fangshan District Business Council in the PRC to acquire the controlling interest of Beitun Trading Co. Ltd. (“Beitun Trading”). Beitun Trading had a registered capital of RMB500,000 (approximately $80,250), of which RMB255,000 (approximately $40,928) was contributed by CCG and RMB245,000 (approximately $39,323) was contributed by Wei Guo. Effectively, CCG had control of 51% of Beitun Trading, and Wei Guo owned 49% of Beitun Trading. Through Beitun Trading, we engaged in the wholesale distribution of various food and meat products. On April 1, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our 51% interest in Beitun Trading to Zhang Yifan in exchange for cash payment of RMB 255,000. We have since ceased our distribution business.
Debit Card Program
 
The Company cooperated with a Fuxin Bank, a retail bank in the PRC, to issue cobranded debit cards. Retail store vendors throughout China were signed up to the Company’s debit card program. The Company charged each participating vendor a percentage of transactions with that vendor. Each vendor received a percentage of future transactions of the cards issued by the vendor. Cardholders received certain amounts of cash refund from participating vendors and earned points to be spent on www.ccmus.com. We ceased such operation in 2015.

Peer-to-Peer Lending
 
On December 23, 2014, the Company and Shanghai Zhonghui Financial Information Services Corp., a company established under the laws of People’s Republic of China, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the term of the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), to certain individuals affiliated with Shanghai Zhonghui (the “Zhonghui Affiliates”), valued at $1.00 per share for a total of $5,000,000 or approximately 31,000,000 RMB, to exchange 51% of the capital stock of Shanghai Zhonghui. As incentive for the closing of the Acquisition, the Company also agreed to issue to the Affiliates 5,000,000 additional shares of the Common Stock.
 
Established on May 26, 2014, under the PRC laws, Shanghai Zhonghui offers a peer-to-peer lending platform that provided financing and investment opportunities for small to medium sized business and investors, including outsource of financial information technologies, investment management, investment consulting, as well as other related asset management services in China.
 
On December 28, 2016, upon approval by the majority shareholder and Board of Directors of the Company and Arki Network, Arki Network entered into certain business sale agreement with Yanbian YaoTian Gas Group Co., Ltd, a company organized under the laws of the PRC whereby Arki Network sold all of its interest in Shanghai Zhonghui for no consideration.
 
Current Business
 
Our current business is discussed in detail under the Section “Item 1. Business.”
 
Corporate Structure
 
As discussed above, we are a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 25, 2008. Through acquisitions and mergers, we are the parent company of i) Arki (Beijing) E-Commerce Technology Corp., which is a WFOE formed under the laws of the PRC on March 6, 2008 with a registered capital of US$300,000 and legal representative of Jianmin Gao, ii) America Pine (Beijing) Bio-Tech Inc., which is a WFOE formed under the law of the PRC on March 21, 2007 with a registered capital of approximately US$330,000 and legal representative of Jianmin Gao and iii) America Arki (Fuxin) Network Management Co. Ltd., which is a WFOE formed under the laws of the PRC on November 25, 2010 with a registered capital of US$200,000 and legal representative of Jianming Gao.
Contractual Arrangements among Arki E-Commerce, Arki Network, and America Arki
 
 Our relationships with Arki Network, its stockholders, and Arki E-Commerce are governed by a series of contractual arrangements, as we (including our direct and indirect subsidiaries) do not own any equity interests in Arki Network. PRC law currently has limits on foreign ownership of certain companies. These businesses are our VIE businesses. To comply with these restrictions, Arki Network and its shareholders entered into two sets of contractual arrangements with Arki E-Commerce and America Arki in November 2010: 
 
Powers of Attorney. The equity owners of Arki Network irrevocably appointed Arki E-Commerce and America Arki to vote on their behalf on all matters they are entitled to vote on, including matters relating to the transfer of any or all of their respective equity interests in the entity and the appointment of the chief executive officer and other senior management members.
 
Share Pledge Agreements. The equity owners of Arki Network pledged their respective equity interests in the entity as a guarantee for the payment by the entity of consulting and services fees under the business cooperation agreements and repayment under the loan agreements.

Business Cooperation Agreement. Arki E-Commerce and America Arki provide the entity with technical support, consulting services, and other commercial services to Arki Network. The initial term of these agreements is ten years. In consideration for those services, Arki Network agrees to pay Arki E-Commerce and America Arki service fees. The service fees are eliminated upon consolidation.
 
Loan Agreements. Loans were granted to the equity owners of Arki Network by America Arki with the sole and exclusive purpose of providing funds necessary for its capitalization as required by the laws of the PRC.
 
Exclusive Option Agreements. Shareholders of Arki Network granted an option contract to Arki E-Commerce and America Arki to purchase their respective equity interests in the entity. As of the date of this prospectus, we conduct substantially all of our business operations through Arki E-Commerce and America Arki, which hold substantial control over Arki Network’s operations through their contractual arrangements.
 
The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:
 


Our Industry
 
According to a working paper published by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, despite their on-going contributions to China’s economic development, SMEs face significant barriers in accessing credit from state-owned commercial banks. In 2013, only 23.2 percent of bank loans were extended to SMEs. Access to working capital loans is even more restricted: only 4.7 percent of short-term loans went to SMEs. Given these structural constraints on private sector borrowing from state banks, China’s SMEs have depended on non-banking sources of credit since the earliest years of economic reform. In surveys of private businesses conducted during the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, over two-thirds of the respondents indicated that they had relied on some form of informal finance. More recent research indicates that reliance on non-banking financing mechanisms has not abated. A World Bank survey of 2,700 private companies in 2011 to 2013 found that only 25 percent had bank credit and 90 percent drew on internal financing. Within that period, a 2012 survey of SMEs in fifteen provinces conducted by China’s Central University of Finance and Economics (CUFE) found that 57.5 percent had participated in informal credit markets. The bi-annual national surveys private enterprises administered by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce consistently find that ‘accessing bank credit’ is among the top self-reported challenges facing the private sector. As such, SMEs in China continue to rely heavily on non-banking financial intermediaries. (Source: Financing Small and Medium Enterprises in China: Recent Trends and Prospects beyond Shadow Banking, Kellee S. Tsai, HKUST IEMS Working Paper No. 2015-24, May 2015)

In China, the reliance on these non-banking financial intermediaries represents a market response to a combination of policy restrictions and related political priorities. At the most basic level, financial repression allows SOEs to receive subsidised credit, while inhibiting the ability of banks to price loans for higher risk SMEs. As such, since the earliest years of reform, various types of informal financial intermediaries and non-banking financial intermediaries have emerged to fill the SME funding gap. Some lend directly to private businesses, while others guarantee loans from commercial banks. Meanwhile, artificial suppression of deposit rates has driven savers to seek higher returns from other investment opportunities. Banks thus turned to off-balance sheet products to generate earnings from alternative sectors. The recent rise of on-line P2P lending platforms bypasses the banking system altogether by brokering between SMEs and private lenders/investors. This imbalance between supply and demand for capital among SMEs therefore presents business opportunities for us.
 
Business Strategy
 
We plan to implement three primary strategies to expand our market presence within the industry: (i) increase Arki E-Commerce’s lending capacity through the cash generated from operations and capital raised from this offering; (ii) increase the Company’s offering of financial services by expanding the business into financial consulting services throughout China; and (iii) expand the Company’s geographic coverage for both microfinancing and financial advisory service to major metropolitan areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou through the establishment of sales force. We believe that we can experience significant growth in these areas because there is a large number of established SMEs and sole proprietors in need of capital resources but lack the ability to finance either due to their limited size of business or local banks’ preferences to finance bigger and more established companies.
Competitive Strengths
 
Although we operate in a highly-competitive industry, we believe that the following factors provide us with the competitive advantage in the marketplace that could differentiate us from our potential competitors:

● | Strong Relationships with Local Financial Institutions. We have developed strong relationships with local financial institutions. For our microfinancing business, we only provide financing to clients that have been pre-screened by the credit card processing companies such as UnionPay Liaoning, who and Arki Network would then charge a service fee based on the loan amount. The additional stream of revenue incentivizes UnionPay to promote our services and provide us with potential lending opportunities. For our financial advisory services, we assist lenders, often third-party banks, by assessing borrowers’ repayment ability and controlling default risk. In order to best serve our bank clients, we have familiarized ourselves with their product and service offerings, as well as their business needs. The banks, through our risk assessment service, could in turn identify borrowers with relatively low default risk. Our unique product offering helps us build a long-lasting relationship with local financial institutions who are looking to expand and diversify their loan portfolio. It is through leveraging this relationship with many banks that we believe we are able to provide a unique value-added service to our clients and will be able to grow our client base. These banks may also refer us clients that they are unable to serve either due to their internal client assessment requirements or availability of financial product and service offerings. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Experienced and committed leadership. We have had extensive experience in the banking industry prior to the shift of our new core business. For instance, we have accumulated much industry resources and business experience when we issued our co-branded debit card with Fuxin Bank a few years ago. Our management’s experience has provided our company with the skills and expertise that are essential in approaching and selecting appropriate banks, dealing with bank personnel, identifying and evaluating appropriate financial products and services, structuring tailored financial solutions and bargaining with banks on behalf of our clients. In addition, based on our past experience working with SMEs when we engaged in peer-to-peer lending business, we understand the needs of both SMEs and retail investors. We believe the experience and resources that our management can offer will help our company become a more active player in the industry. 


● | Substantial potential client base. For our microfinancing business, our clients are recommended by the Liaoning provincial branch of UnionPay. Almost all businesses of various sizes use UnionPay as their primary credit card payment processor within China. Our collaboration with UnionPay therefore places us in a unique position, as UnionPay’s large portfolio of users could provide us with lending opportunities on a mass scale. As our business grows, we believe the existing clients will also continue to be a referral source of our business.

Competition 

The microfinancing industry in China is intensely competitive and we compete with companies of various sizes. We believe that our major competition come from three sectors. First, many local banks and financial institutions, especially those located in Tier 2 or 3 cities in China have started engaging in lending business to finance SMEs locally. The banks and institutions have long-lasting relationships with the businesses locally. In addition, because most of the banks in China are state-owned enterprises (“SOEs”) or invested by SOEs, they have much more financial resources than we do. Second, we compete with many peer-to-peer lending platforms that match lenders and borrowers. Our key competitors include Yirendai, which is a public company listed on the NYSE, Ren Ren Dai and Lufax. Lastly, there are many private lending companies throughout China. In order to compete with them, including some of more established ones, we will need to be able to provide products that would be more attractive to the borrowers, including lower interest rate or free of collateral. We also compete with other financial products that attract borrowers. For example, we compete with traditional financial institutions, such as consumer finance business units in commercial banks, credit card issuers and other consumer finance companies. In light of the low barriers to entry in the microfinancing industry, more players may enter this market and increase the level of competition. We anticipate that more established internet, technology and financial services companies that possess large, existing user bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels may enter the market in the future.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark and trade secret law and confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights.
Domains
 
Consumer Capital Group Inc. has one domain name: www.ccgusa.com.
 
Arki Network holds the ICP license issued by the Beijing Communications Control Bureau No. 100852 on June 28, 2013 and expires on August 31, 2018, subject to renewal. We have registered two websites using this ICP license: www.ccmus.com and www.bangnitou.net. www.ccmus.com was created for our E-Commerce business and www.bangnitou.net, which also has a corresponding mobile application, has been created for our wealth management business. As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, neither business has generated substantial revenue as of today, if any.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 
In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring their non-infringement of our intellectual property rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Moreover, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.

Marketing and Sales
 
Microfinancing Business
 
 Pursuant to the collaboration agreement between Arki Network and UnionPay Liaoning, we do not engage in any substantial marketing efforts for our microfinancing business. However, because UnionPay is incentivized to market our loan products to their clients and almost all businesses in China use UnionPay as their primary credit card processing company, we believe that the lack of marketing efforts on our own will not significantly deter the development of our business. 
Financial Advisory Service
 
Offline Marketing Activities. We rely on the sales teams to reach out to our potential clients through cold phone calls or personal meetings. The sales force receives commission for successful generation of service engagement. In addition, we leverage their presence in local cities to promote and raise awareness of our products.
 
Online Marketing Activities. To further promote our brand, we also take advantage of the Internet and various mobile social network applications, such as Wechat and Weibo, through which we introduce basic products and services information, market research and updates to our members.
 
Wealth Management Business
 
While we have had limited operation and income from our wealth management business, the existing clients have come to us through referrals from existing relationships and we believe word-of-mouth is an especially effective marketing tool for the wealth management product, as our product mainly targets retail investors. We intend to engage in nationwide marketing initiatives to further raise our brand awareness while continuing to improve client satisfaction to strengthen our word-of-mouth referrals. We also encourage our employees to introduce or recommend new clients to us by providing incentive bonus.
 
 This business is operated through the Bangnitou website platform which had limited operations during the fiscl year ended December 31, 2017. 
 
Insurance
 
We maintain property insurance policies covering certain equipment and other property that are essential to our business operation to safeguard against risks and unexpected events. We also provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance for our employees. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key-man insurance. We consider our insurance coverage to be sufficient for our business operations in China.
Seasonality
 
We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional personal consumption patterns, as our individual borrowers typically use their borrowing proceeds to finance their personal consumption needs. For example, we generally experience lower transaction value on our online consumer finance marketplace during national holidays in China, particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday season in the first quarter of each year. Overall, the historical seasonality of our business has been mild due to our rapid growth but may increase further in the future. Due to our limited operating history, the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may not apply to, or be indicative of, our future operating results.
 
PRC Regulations

Online commerce in China is subject to a number of laws and regulations. This section summarizes all material PRC laws and regulations relevant to our business and operations in China and the key provisions of such regulations.

Corporate Laws and Industry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment
 
The establishment, operation, and management of corporate entities in China are governed by the Company Law of the PRC, or the Company Law, effective in 1994, as amended in 1999, 2004, and 2005, respectively. The Company Law is applicable to our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated PRC entity unless the PRC laws on foreign investment have stipulated otherwise.
 
The establishment, approval, registered capital requirement, and day-to-day operational matters of wholly foreign-owned enterprises (“WFOE”), such as our PRC subsidiary, Arki Network, are regulated by the WFOE Law of the PRC effective in 1986, as amended in 2000, and the Implementation Rules of the WFOE Law of the PRC effective in 1990, as amended in 2001. 
 
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue divides industries into three categories: encouraged, restricted, and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.
 
Establishment of WFOEs is generally permitted in encouraged industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures.
 
For example, sales and distribution of audio and video products are among the restricted categories, and only contractual joint ventures in which Chinese partners holding majority interests can engage in the distribution of audio and video products in China.
 
In addition, restricted category projects are also subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
 
Regulations Relating to Telecommunications Services
 
In September 2000, the State Council issued the Regulations on Telecommunications of China (“the Telecommunications Regulations”), to regulate telecommunications activities in China. The telecommunications industry in China is governed by a licensing system based on the classifications of the telecommunications services set forth under the Telecommunications Regulations.
 
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) together with the provincial-level communications administrative bureaus, supervises and regulates the telecommunications industry in China. The Telecommunications Regulations divide the telecommunications services into two categories: infrastructure telecommunications services and value-added telecommunications services. The operation of value-added telecommunications services is subject to the examination, approval, and the granting of licenses by MIIT or the provincial-level communications administrative bureaus. According to the Catalogue of Classification of Telecommunications Businesses effective in April 2003, provision of information services through the internet, such as the operation of our website, is classified as value-added telecommunications services.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Industry
 
According to the Administrative Rules for Foreign Investment in Telecommunications Enterprises issued by the State Council effective in January 2002, as amended in September 2008, a foreign investor may hold no more than a 50% equity interest in a value-added telecommunications services provider in China, and such foreign investor must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services overseas and maintain a good track record.
 
13

 

The Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business (“the Circular”), issued by the former Ministry of Information Industry (“MII”) in July 2006, reiterated the regulations on foreign investment in telecommunications businesses, which require foreign investors to set up foreign-invested enterprises and obtain an internet content provider, or ICP, license to conduct any value-added telecommunications business in China. Under the Circular, a domestic company that holds an ICP license is prohibited from leasing, transferring, or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites, or facilities, to foreign investors that conduct value-added telecommunications business illegally in China. Furthermore, certain relevant assets, such as the relevant trademarks and domain names that are used in the value-added telecommunications business must be owned by the local ICP license holder or its shareholders. The Circular further requires each ICP license holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. If an ICP license holder fails to comply with the requirements in the Circular and also fails to remedy such non-compliance within a specified period of time, MII or its local counterparts have the discretion to take administrative measures against such license holder, including revoking its ICP license. We believe Arki Network is in compliance with the Circular. 
 
Regulations Relating to Internet Information Services and Content of Internet Information
 
In September 2000, the State Council issued the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services (“the Internet Measures”), to regulate the provision of information services to online users through the internet. According to the Internet Measures, internet information services are divided into two categories: services of an operative nature and services of a non-operative nature. Our business conducted through our website involves operating internet information services, which requires us to obtain an ICP license. If an internet information service provider fails to obtain an ICP license, the relevant local branch of MII may levy fines, confiscate its income, or even block its website. Due to the PRC law restriction that foreign investors cannot hold more than a 50% equity interest in a value-added telecommunications services provider, we hold our ICP license through Arki Network. Arki Network currently holds an ICP license issued by Beijing Communications Administration, a local branch of MII.
 
The Internet Measures further specify that the internet information services regarding, among others, news, publication, education, medical and health care, and pharmacy and medical appliances are required to be examined, approved, and regulated by the relevant authorities. Internet content providers are prohibited from providing services beyond that included in the scope of their business license or other required licenses or permits. Furthermore, the Internet Measures clearly specify a list of prohibited content. Internet content providers must monitor and control the information posted on their websites. We are subject to this rule as a result of our operation of our online marketplace program.
 
Regulations Relating to Privacy Protection
 
As an internet content provider, we are subject to regulations relating to protection of privacy. Under the Internet Measures, internet content providers are prohibited from producing, copying, publishing or distributing information that is humiliating or defamatory to others or that infringes the lawful rights and interests of others. Internet content providers that violate the prohibition may face criminal charges or administrative sanctions by PRC security authorities. In addition, relevant authorities may suspend their services, revoke their licenses or temporarily suspend or close down their websites. Furthermore, under the Administration of Internet Bulletin Board Services issued by the MII in November 2000, internet content providers that provide electronic bulletin board services must keep users’ personal information confidential and are prohibited from disclosing such personal information to any third party without the consent of the users, unless otherwise required by law. The regulation further authorizes relevant telecommunication authorities to order internet content providers to rectify any unauthorized disclosure. Internet content providers could be subject to legal liabilities if unauthorized disclosure causes damages or losses to internet users. However, the PRC government retains the power and authority to order internet content providers to provide the personal information of internet users if the users post any prohibited content or engage in illegal activities through the internet. We believe that we are currently in compliance with these regulations in all material aspects.
Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
In January 2008, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (The “EIT” Law) took effect. The EIT applies a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, unless where tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. Under the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax.
 
Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC “resident enterprises” will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC “resident enterprises” to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. 
 
14

 

Under the implementation regulations to the EIT Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances, and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC-invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or residence in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation, and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and half or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange
 
Pursuant to the Regulations on the Administration of Foreign Exchange issued by the State Council and effective in 1996, as amended in January 1997 and August 2008, current account transactions, such as sale or purchase of goods, are not subject to PRC governmental control or restrictions. Certain organizations in the PRC, including foreign-invested enterprises, may purchase, sell, and/or remit foreign currencies at certain banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business upon providing valid commercial documents. Approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), however, is required for capital account transactions.
 
In August 2008, SAFE issued a circular on the conversion of foreign currency into Renminbi by a foreign-invested company that regulates how the converted Renminbi may be used. The circular requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise converted into Renminbi from foreign currencies may only be utilized for purposes within its business scope. For example, such converted amounts may not be used for investments in or acquisitions of other PRC companies, unless specifically provided otherwise, which can inhibit the ability of companies to consummate such transactions. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises converted from foreign currencies. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been utilized. Violations may result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines.
 
 As an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may transfer funds to our PRC subsidiaries or finance our operating entity by means of loans or capital contributions. Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to our Company’s PRC subsidiaries, including from the proceeds of this offering, are subject to PRC regulations. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries, which are foreign-invested enterprises, cannot exceed statutory limits based on the difference between the amount of our investments and registered capital in such subsidiaries, and shall be registered with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), or its local counterparts. Furthermore, any capital increase contributions we make to our PRC subsidiaries, which are foreign-invested enterprises, shall be approved by China’s Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), or its local counterparts. We may not be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals or make such registration, our ability to make equity contributions or provide loans to our Company’s PRC subsidiaries or to fund their operations may be negatively affected, which may adversely affect their liquidity and ability to fund their working capital and expansion projects and meet their obligations and commitments. As a result, our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business may be negatively affected. 
      In order for us to make direct capital contributions to our PRC based businesses, the proceeds must be sent to China, and the process for sending such proceeds back to China may take as long as six months. We may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to our subsidiaries in China, which are foreign-invested enterprises, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE. 
 
 Generally, we must take the following steps: 
 

● | First, we will open a special foreign exchange account for capital account transactions. To open this account, we must submit to SAFE certain application forms, identity documents, transaction documents, form of foreign exchange registration of overseas investments of the domestic residents, and foreign exchange registration certificate of the invested company. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Second, we remit the funds into this special foreign exchange account. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Third, we will apply for settlement of the foreign exchange. In order to do so, we must submit to SAFE certain application forms, identity documents, payment order to a designated person, and a tax certificate. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 The timing of the process is difficult to estimate because the efficiencies of different SAFE branches can vary significantly. Ordinarily the process takes several months but is required by law to be accomplished within 180 days of application. 
 
Regulations Relating to Labor
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law effective in 1995 and the PRC Labor Contract Law effective in 2008, a written labor contract is required when an employment relationship is established between an employer and an employee. Other labor-related regulations and rules of the PRC stipulate the maximum number of working hours per day and per week as well as the minimum wages. An employer is required to set up occupational safety and sanitation systems, implement the national occupational safety and sanitation rules and standards, educate employees on occupational safety and sanitation, prevent accidents at work, and reduce occupational hazards.
 
15

 

In the PRC, workers dispatched by an employment agency are normally engaged in temporary, auxiliary, or substitute work. Pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law, an employment agency is the employer for workers dispatched by it and must perform an employer’s obligations toward them. The employment contract between the employment agency and the dispatched workers, and the placement agreement between the employment agency and the company that receives the dispatched workers must be in writing. Also, the company that accepts the dispatched workers must bear joint and several liabilities for any violation of the Labor Contract Law by the employment agencies arising from their contracts with dispatched workers. An employer is obligated to sign an indefinite term labor contract with an employee if the employer continues to employ the employee after two consecutive fixed-term labor contracts. The employer also has to pay compensation to the employee if the employer terminates an indefinite term labor contract. Except where the employer proposes to renew a labor contract by maintaining or raising the conditions of the labor contract and the employee is not agreeable to the renewal, an employer is required to compensate the employee when a definite term labor contract expires. Furthermore, under the Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees issued by the State Council in December 2007 and effective as of January 2008, employees who have served an employer for more than one (1) year and less than ten years are entitled to a 5-day paid vacation, those whose service period ranges from 10 to 20 years are entitled to a 10-day paid vacation, and those who have served for more than 20 years are entitled to a 15-day paid vacation. An employee who does not use such vacation time at the request of the employer shall be compensated at three times their normal salaries for each waived vacation day.
 
Pursuant to the Regulations on Occupational Injury Insurance effective in 2004 and the Interim Measures concerning the Maternity Insurance for Enterprise Employees effective in 1995, PRC companies must pay occupational injury insurance premiums and maternity insurance premiums for their employees. Pursuant to the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums effective in 1999 and the Interim Measures concerning the Administration of the Registration of Social Insurance effective in 1999, basic pension insurance, medical insurance, and unemployment insurance are collectively referred to as social insurance. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the social insurance plans. Pursuant to the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Fund effective in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing fund management centers and establish a special housing fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the housing funds. The PRC Subsidiaries and Arki Network are in process of applying for registration for social insurance and opening a housing fund account.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution
 
Wholly foreign-owned companies in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits after tax as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise out of China is subject to examination by the banks designated by SAFE. Wholly foreign-owned companies may not pay dividends unless they set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits after tax each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such time as the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50% of the wholly foreign-owned company’s registered capital. In addition, these companies also may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Safe Regulations on Offshore Special Purpose Companies Held by PRC Residents or Citizens
 
Pursuant to the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Inbound Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular No. 75, issued in October 2005 by SAFE and its supplemental notices, PRC citizens or residents are required to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving a roundtrip investment whereby the offshore entity acquires or controls onshore assets or equity interests held by the PRC citizens or residents. In addition, such PRC citizens or residents must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, mergers or divisions, long-term equity or debt investments, external guarantees, or other material events that do not involve roundtrip investments. Subsequent regulations further clarified that PRC subsidiaries of an offshore company governed by the SAFE regulations are required to coordinate and supervise the filing of SAFE registrations in a timely manner by the offshore holding company’s shareholders who are PRC citizens or residents. If these shareholders fail to comply, the PRC subsidiaries are required to report to the local SAFE branches. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC citizens or residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.
 
 We may also decide to finance our subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by MOFCOM or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future capital contributions by us to our subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.

  The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our income is primarily derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our security-holders.

M&A Rules
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), promulgated a rule entitled Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (“the M&A Rules”) to regulate foreign investment in PRC domestic enterprises. The M&A rules, among other things, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle (“SPV”), formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. We believe that while the CSRC generally has jurisdiction over overseas listings of SPVs like us, CSRC’s approval is not required for this offering given the fact that no provision in the M&A Rules classifies the respective contractual arrangements between Arki Network and Arki E-Commerce and between Arki Network and America Arki as a type of acquisition transaction falling under the M&A Rules. There remains some uncertainty as to how this regulation will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that approval is required for this offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency.
 
The M&A Rules also establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise.
 
Safe Regulations on Employee Share Options
 
On March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Share Holding Plan or Share Option Plan of Overseas Listed Company, or the Share Option Rule. Pursuant to the Share Option Rule, Chinese citizens who are granted share options by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the overseas publicly listed company and complete certain other procedures. Our PRC employees who have been granted share options will be subject to these regulations. Failure of our PRC share option holders to complete their SAFE registrations may subject these PRC employees to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to us.
