ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
This Business section, along with other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data and we do not make any representation as to the accuracy of the information. Unless the context otherwise requires, “Hour Loop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refers to Hour Loop, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
Our Business
 
We are an online retailer engaged in e-commerce retailing in the U.S. market. We have operated as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com since 2013. We have also sold merchandise on our website at www.hourloop.com since 2013. We expanded our operations to www.walmart.com in October 2020. To date, we have generated practically all of our revenue as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com and only a negligible amount of revenue from our operations on our website at www.hourloop.com and as a third-party seller on www.walmart.com. We manage more than 100,000 stock-keeping units (“SKUs”). Product categories include home/garden décor, toys, kitchenware, apparels, and electronics. Our primary strategy is to bring most of our vendors product selections to the customers. We have advanced software that assists us in identifying product gaps so we can keep such products in stock year-round including the entirety of the last quarter (holiday season) of the calendar year (“Q4”). In upcoming years, we plan to expand our business rapidly by increasing the number of business managers, vendors and SKUs.
Business Model
 
There are three main types of business models on Amazon: wholesale, private label and retail arbitrage. Our business model is wholesale, also known as reselling, which refers to buying products in bulk directly from the brand or manufacturer at a wholesale price and making a profit by selling the product on Amazon. We sell merchandise on Amazon and the sales are fulfilled by Amazon. We pay Amazon fees for allowing us to sell on their platform. Our relationship with Walmart is also similar. We pay Walmart fees for allowing us to sell our merchandise on their platform. As stated above, to date, we have generated only a negligible amount of revenues as a third-party seller on www.walmart.com.
 
The advantages of selling via a wholesale model:
 

- | Purchase lower unit quantities with wholesale orders than private label products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Selling wholesale is less time intensive and easier to scale than sourcing products via retail arbitrage. 
- | More brands will want to work with us because we can provide broader Amazon presence. 

 
The challenges of selling via a wholesale model:
 

- | Fierce competition on listing for Buy Box on amazon.com (as described below). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Developing and maintaining relationships with brand manufacturers.

Market description/opportunities
 
Total retail sales increased 6.9% to $4.04 trillion in 2020 from $3.78 trillion in 2019. Consumers spent $861.12 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2020, which is around 21.3% of total retail sales for 2020, compared to 15.8% for 2019.    
 
Amazon accounted for nearly a third of all e-commerce in the United States. With a more than 5% gain in e-commerce penetration for U.S. retail sales in 2020, we anticipate a larger market in the upcoming years.    
 
Formation and Management
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on January 13, 2015. However, we converted from a Washington corporation to a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2021. The company was founded in 2013 by Sam Lai and Maggie Yu. With their vision, leadership, and software development skills, the company grew rapidly. From 2013 to 2021, sales grew from $0 to $62,792,981.  
 
Competitive advantage
 
Among 9.7 million sellers on Amazon, we believe we have two main competitive advantages. First, we have strong operations and sales teams experienced in listing, shipment, advertising, reconciliation and sales. By delivering high quality results and enhancing procedures through the process, our teams are competitive. Second, we believe our proprietary software system gives us an advantage over our competition. The system is highly customized to our business model; it collects and processes large amounts of data every day to optimize our operation and sales. Through advanced software, we can identify product gaps and keep them in stock all year round.
 
With respect to our advertising strategy, we advertise those products that we estimate will have greater demand based on our experience. This lets us allocate our advertising budget in a fashion that delivers positive value. We advertise our products on Amazon. We allocate our advertising dollars prudently. This is accomplished by advertising items that deliver the most return for our advertising spending. We monitor the items being advertised by our competitors. On the operations side, we constantly refine our processes based on learnings from historical data. The combination of managing the business operations effectively along with allocating our advertising budget to high value items allows us to grow profitably. In cases, where the advertising is fierce, we allocate the spending appropriately. Our strategy for competing with larger competitors is to monitor their pricing and not compete with them when their pricing is low or at a loss. Competitors sell at low prices or at a loss due to a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, their desire to liquidate inventory or achieve short term increase in revenue. During these times, we avoid matching their prices. This strategy allows us to stay profitable.
 
Historical Performance
 
Our year end gross revenues and net profits from 2013 through 2021 is presented in the table below:

Pricing Strategy and Policies
 
In an ideal world, we would like to price our products at key stone pricing or double wholesale cost. However, we operate in a hyper competitive environment and we must stay competitive. Therefore, we must draw a good balance between gross margin and revenue. Our main objectives focus on increasing volume and maximizing profits, which is achieved with a customized auto pricing system we developed internally, in combination with well-trained business managers’ judgment on pricing skills as well as constant monitoring. One principal feature of the pricing system is that it automatically syncs public data of competing offers from Amazon regularly, so business managers can make price settings and adjustments based on accurate data, and thus be able to set optimal selling prices for products. In addition, the system is constantly improved with new features and optimizations.
 
At a high level, our automated pricing tool helps us stay competitive while our business managers mainly focus on increasing gross margins. Our proprietary repricing tool analyze sales trend, projected sales, inventory age, inventory cost, potential profits, FBA fees, competing offers, and seasonality and determines an urgency level, then depending on the level of urgency, it automatically adjusts prices accordingly.
 
Business managers, after establishing the bases for prices, begin to develop pricing strategies for each product while taking the current market conditions, company goals (ex: increasing short-term or long-term profits) and strategies into consideration. Furthermore, business managers consider different marketing segments such as costs and competitions in order to develop effective pricing strategies and policies.
 
The following subsections provide more insight into various pricing strategies we have developed over the years. Our internal training mainly focuses on competition-based pricing policy and value-based pricing policy.
 

1. | Competition-Based Pricing Policy: 20% of our products are toys, which are extremely popular and competitive. In this type of environment where volume is high but gross margin is low, our main strategy is to purchase large quantities, so we can increase sales volume and price competitively while maintaining an average return on investment (“ROI”) of at least 15%. We are using the competition-based pricing policy to match competitor’s prices, which means constantly winning Buy Box (as described below). Our pricing system is capable of automatically matching all Buy Box. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Promotional Pricing Policy: To boost lagging sales, we adapted our own promotional pricing policy, which involves offering modest discounts on products with inventory age over 45 days, which proves to be a cost-effective at reducing the number of low turn-over SKUs. 
3. | Value-Based Pricing Policy: We incorporate a value-based pricing strategy when inventories are constrained, which can happen when customer demand suddenly spikes due to external factors, supply shortage, or seasonal spikes. We set prices to reflect the value perceived by customers, especially on products under gift categories when consumer demands are higher. Contrary to a typical seller, we opt to maintain high gross margin instead of marking down prices and running special deals during the high-demand season during Q4. Therefore, business managers can achieve increases in both sales and high average ROI of 40%. 

 
Buy Box on amazon.com is the top right section on a product page where customers can directly add items to their shopping carts. Since many sellers on amazon.com can sell the same product, they must compete to “win the Buy Box” for a certain product. Winning the Amazon Buy Box simply means that you were chosen for the Buy Box placement. When you win this placement, customers have a button to directly add your product to their carts, giving you an advantage over competing sellers. For a seller to be eligible for the Buy Box, they must meet a set of performance-based requirements including order defect rate, customer shopping experience, time and experience on the Amazon selling platform, and status as a professional seller.

Overview of Market & Competition
 
According to Marketplace Pulse, U.S. e-commerce grew 32% in 2020 to reach $790 billion, up from $598 billion the year before. According to the Department of Commerce, e-commerce represented 14% of total retail spending, a significant increase from 11.3% in 2019.
 
For the past 10 years, e-commerce in the U.S. grew, on average, 15% year-over-year. In 2020, the market reached a total sales figure it would have otherwise gotten to in 2021. Thus, two years of e-commerce growth in one year.
 

According to Marketplace Pulse, Amazon was one of the big winners in the fourth quarter, a record quarter with nearly $250 billion in e-commerce spending. While during the first two quarters boosted by the pandemic - Q2 and Q3 - it grew at or below the overall U.S. e-commerce growth rate. In the fourth quarter, Amazon grew faster than the market (based on a naive comparison of its reported North America segment growth). Its fulfillment capacity allowed the company to be more confident with deliveries than its main rivals.

Target market size
 
Total Addressable Market
 
As an e-commerce company retailing in the U.S. market, our total addressable market covers all U.S. residents with Internet access, where segmentally includes repeat customers and new customers to online shopping every year.
Growth of E-commerce vs. Total Retail Sales
 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce data, the e-commerce’s share of total retail sales has steadily been on the rise, where total volume increased by an incredible 44% of year-over-year growth. The total retail sales increased by 6.9% to $4.04 trillion from 2019 to 2020, and all growths came from the e-commerce sales. Consumers spent $861.12 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2020, which is around 21.3% of total retail sales for the year compared to 15.8% in 2019. The strong growth of U.S. online spending shows the future potential of our target market size. The U.S. e-commerce sales accounted for more than 20% of total retail sales in 2020, and Amazon represented one-third of the total.  
Growth of Amazon Prime Members
 
In 2021, Amazon had over 150 million Prime Members in the U.S., and we were seeing continuous year-over-year growth over the past years. The number of Amazon Prime users in the U.S. is forecasted to reach more than 153 million by 2022, with 3% annual growth.  
Operational Advantages
 
According to Marketplace Pulse, Hour Loop is one of the top 100 third-party sellers on U.S. Amazon. In 2019 there were only 18,000 sellers, out of 2,700,000 (or 0.67%) that exceeded $1 million in annual sales. Our sales in 2019 were $26.6 million.  
Automation
 
We developed a proprietary software that is tailor made to all our operational needs. This includes managing order review process, shipment managements, inventory management, accounting, and complete end-to-end third-party integrations. This allows us to scale, reduce cost, and improve quality.
Profitability Management
 
We have experienced operations managers tracking team performances with key performance indicators. We have departments specializing in logistic costs, advertising, marketing, and product management. We hold monthly process reviews to identify early red flags and look for areas to optimize. Each quarter we set increasingly difficult bars both to grow gross margin and further reduce expenses.
Continuous Process Optimization
 
In order to improve operating efficiencies, we have effective process optimization adapting to the changing policies of the e-commerce marketplace. We continuously analyze our performance based on data. We conduct pricing, inventory planning and profitability analysis using this data. This analysis provides us with insights on the processes that add the most value. Using these insights, we develop guidelines that help us improve our operations. These guidelines are incorporated into our operations which include (but are not limited to), identifying and ordering at optimal inventory levels, managing merchandise storage costs, optimizing transit times, and pricing at appropriate levels. Our operations staff follows these guidelines which help them perform optimally. By continuously analyzing data, we are able to find insights for improving our business. This drives continuous process optimization and its implementation into our operations. In addition, our proprietary software allows us to continually accelerate process effectiveness based on specific requirements. Over time, our system eliminates unnecessary procedures that could be replaced by an advanced algorithm. For instance, we simplify Fulfillment by Amazon (“FBA”) shipments process through application programming interface (“API”) integration. Our self-developed system also tracks insightful analysis of our profitability, clearer visualizes the drivers and optimums to better manage operational costs. We monitor operational parameters that drive our business and proactively try to optimize them. These include fine tuning our item selection, managing our inventory levels, estimating demand and pricing to maximize our profitability.

Data-Driven Approach
 
We make decisions based on analysis and interpretation of the data sets rather than observations over the market trend. By standardizing processes and combine data-driven management, we can ensure the organization maintains consistency that is high quality. Our business managers use historical data and sales projection provided by our proprietary software to find potential product gaps and keep products in stock all year round. This advantage enables powerful predictive insights in correlating real-time data with past sales patterns.
 
Training Programs
 
Our effective training programs accelerates employees’ professional development and enables the company to hire new graduates or people without experience. Our training programs are very task-specific and we continually improve the materials in order to fit new industry needs. Other than the training material, we assign mentors to evaluate and monitor trainees’ performance at each stage of the training program.
Task Generalization
 
By generalizing each task with a standard process, we are able to shift assignments at regular intervals in order to find the most suitable employee for each specific task. Moreover, business managers are also able to rotate the vendors they manage easily. This allows our organization to effectively and consistently manage a vendor when a key employee who previously managed such vendor is no longer with the company. In addition, the task generalization allows the company to hire remote teams to further reduce labor costs.
Multicultural Management
 
We have a multicultural management team that is linguistically and culturally diverse in order to make judgments from different perspectives. Our remote teams in Taiwan and the Philippines provide diverse professional insights on specific tasks.
 
Technological advantages
 
Our software architecture was designed from the ground up to be scalable, secured, and easily extensible. By using JRuby on Rails, we can make use the best parts of Java, Ruby, and Rails without paying for their disadvantages. For example, we can use the massive collections of Java library, portability, speed, multi-threading, and maturity, but we do not have to be tied down with verbose code and strict typing. Rails allow us to quickly build web pages and integrate both the frontend and the backend. The application runs on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and can be easily scaled up to as many hosts as needed. It is accessible from a browser, so there is no need to setup or install anything on the client-side.
 
Cost advantage
 
Access to Low Product Costs
 
We lower our product average costs by direct import items that have high volume, purchasing in bulk with better prices, and negotiating discounts or rebates over increased purchase volume every year. Our strong growth of purchase every year allows us to negotiate better discounts than the rivals. Therefore, we have the cost advantages to compete at low prices.
Efficient Processes and Technologies
 
Our proprietary software allows us to tailor make tools based on our specific use cases and leverage technologies to greatly reduce manual operations. We also saved the expense of using third-party software in managing inventory, orders, product listings, and especially the advertising analytic tool.

Low Distribution and Logistic costs
 
We saved the cost of managing the warehouse, shipping, and product distribution as we are enrolled in Amazon’s FBA program. The program allows us to reduce fixed costs of the physical assets and quickly scale up the business without thinking much about infrastructure complexity. Apart from using the FBA program, we also use FedEx, Amazon partnered carrier, Amazon Freight, and Amazon Global Logistics to reduce expense. The competitive shipping rates we secured provide us a cost-efficient way to deliver shipments from overseas and domestic to Amazon warehouse.
 
Efficiently Managed Operations
 
We have a good management structure within the firm and a data-driven system that allows employees to manage tasks quickly and cost-efficiently.
 
Reduced Labor Costs
 
Our labor cost is below 5% of our revenue.   We leverage third-party logistic companies to forward or prep our shipments to Amazon, which reduces our logistic operation labor costs. We also worked with labor outsourcing partner located in Philippines. They provide virtual assistants to help us with data entries and repetitive work, which is a very cost-effective way to do a lot of grunt work.
 
Key Competitors by Market Size/Share
 
Our key competitor is Amazon Retail. Amazon Retail frequently buys from the same brands we sell and sells them at a loss. Amazon Retails offers can be identified by the “Sold by Amazon” tag on Amazon’s site, and they are formed by the two components: (i) Amazon Vendor Central, and (ii) Sold by Amazon program. We do not consider other third-party sellers as key competitors, because none of them represent enough market share to influence sales outcome. The addressable market is incredibly vast, thus we believe there are plenty of opportunities for everyone.
 
Amazon Vendor Central
 
Amazon Vendor Central allows manufacturers and brand owners to sell directly to Amazon as a first-party seller. This is one of the key competitive factors as Amazon usually buys bulk from the brands and sells at a very low price, which leads to hyper-competitive pricing. On pricing control, Amazon does not always follow the Minimum Advertised Pricing guidelines from manufacturers, which also puts us at a disadvantage when selling the same products.
Sold by Amazon Program
 
With the rise of e-commerce platforms, Amazon is looking for opportunities to attract customers away from its retail store rivals. In 2019, Amazon rolled out a new program entitled Sold by Amazon (“SBA”) to help sellers grow their business. This program gives brand owners the control of inventory management and listings with Amazon having the authority to constantly monitor and change the price to make sure customers are getting the best deals. Once the products are enrolled in the SBA program, Amazon will set the Minimum Gross Proceeds (“MGP”) to pay sellers the lowest possible amount on each unit sold. This new program is another threat to our company as Amazon is the one taking control of pricing, and they set the price very low in order to compete with competitors’ low price strategy.
Competitor Strengths and Weaknesses
 
Strengths of Sold by Amazon
 
First, ship from and Sold by Amazon creates competition for potential customers who prefer to buy products from Amazon rather than a third-party seller. Secondly, Amazon monitors and manages pricing which makes the product price range at a highly competitive level. In fact, the chance of Amazon winning buy box is even higher as they have the best deal for customers. Finally, Amazon is not restricted by its policy to third-party sellers. One of the critical policies is the restock limit. Amazon limits certain items restock quantities based on recent sales activity, and this affects the in-stock rate of popular items that needs a greater volume.

Weaknesses of Sold by Amazon
 
As Amazon focuses on sales more than relationships with vendors, they do not follow vendors’ Minimum Advertised Pricing (“MAP”) strictly. We believe this has led to the devaluation of brands and will have a negative impact on building a long-term relationship with the vendors. Once the vendor hands over their price control to Amazon, we believe it is unlikely for them to sell at their original target price further, and it influences their offline sales. And in fact, it makes a huge difference in profitability to both Amazon and the vendor when reacts to the competitive pricing changes.
 
Apart from the weaknesses of business relationships, we believe Amazon also has disadvantages in the niche marketplaces, where product offerings are narrower and more personalized. As a third-party seller, we cooperate with vendors in developing custom projects that bring product differentiation and scarcity effect. However, we believe Amazon only concentrates on the masses, which gives them the deficiency of having products that are targeted in certain market segments.
 
Potential Substitute Products Posing Credible Threat to Company Products
 
No potential substitute products would pose a credible threat to our company as we have developed a wide product diversification.
 
As a company that focuses on reselling wholesale products, we have the resilience to find substitution of products or brands. We established product diversification by managing wide range of SKUs and continually expand our product categories. Our business strategy allows us to mitigate risk and generate significant profit by selling low volumes items diversified across a large variety of products.
 
In contrast, private labels sellers manage small number of SKUs that have large volumes in return with higher profit per unit. However, private labels have much higher risk when experiencing stagnant or declining sales as they would have lower capability to find sales replacements that are already established.
 
Strength of Barriers to Entry
 
Higher Capital, Low Margin: Selling online is general low margin, but it requires high capital investment in order to purchase goods and run advertising.
 
Product Differentiation: Our proprietary software allows us to manage a huge number of SKUs. This allows us to participate in profitable long-tail products in addition to well-known popular ones. The turnover rate for long-tail products is slow, so newcomers are not likely to enter. It also requires a sophisticated system to manage. Furthermore, vendor relationships do not happen overnight.
 
Advanced System: We have already developed a highly sophisticated system which has been refined over time to become highly effective. Even if a new entrant has a team of the best software engineers in the world, it will still take them many years to refine their system. There is a myriad of intricacies as to the effectiveness of a system. Even if the new entrants have the system built, it will still take them years to collect historical sales data. By the time new entrants have done all that, our system would have continued to mature. This means we would be able to manage more SKUs more profitably with lower costs.
 
Risk of Entry- Potential Entrants
 
Vendor Vertical Integration: A vendor may forward integrate into the e-commerce marketplace in order to directly engage with their online customers.
 
Multichannel E-commerce: There is a chance of established online retail firms such as sellers on eBay, Walmart, and Etsy expanding their business to the Amazon marketplace.
 
Brick-and-Mortar: As the online retail is growing and offline retail is contracting, there are more brick-and-mortar stores migrating from offline to online.

Improving Sales of Popular Items and Securing the Inventories Without Paying Higher Storage Fees By Engaging the Services of Third Party Warehouses
 
As a retailer our success is heavily influenced by the inventory control of our suppliers (vendors). However, many of our suppliers are having difficulties to maintain their stock level due to various reasons, such as the shortage of shipping containers, lack of labor, or disruption in manufacturing. The situation exacerbates during the pandemic and in peak season. In order to secure the inventories, we start to order large quantities of popular items or buying them out to store in the Amazon fulfillment center (“FC”). However, the monthly storage fee of Amazon FC in peak season (Q4) is 3.5 times higher than normal season, which puts pressure on our profits. To maintain the balance of inventory level and margins, we are currently contracting the warehousing services of third-party warehouses, including, Rahl Distribution, Inc., Rite Prep Shipping, 3Plzen, Carolina Prep & Ship, and West FBA to support our overall stock planning process. By doing this, we can improve sales by preventing popular items from going out of stock, since we had secured adequate inventories ahead of time. Furthermore, we can also avoid paying higher Amazon storage fees in Q4.
Growth Objectives
 
In 2021, we plan to grow the number of suppliers from 226 to 300, the number of business managers from 20 to 50, the number of active SKUs from 42,000 to 60,000, and the number of total employees from 60 to 120. In 2022, we plan to grow the number of suppliers to 650, the number of business managers to 200, the number of active SKUs to 130,000, and the number of total employees to 250. In 2023, we plan to grow the number of suppliers to 1,200, the number of business managers to 350, the number of active SKUs to 200,000, and the number of total employees to 500. In 2024, we plan to grow the number of suppliers to 2000, the number of business managers to 600, the number of active SKUs to 300,000, and the number of total employees to 900.   We believe in order to be successful in the long-term, we must invest in talents.
 
New business managers are the key to growth, they are analogous to new stores in a traditional brick and mortar retail business. Although the return on investment is extremely high over the long-term when investing in people, initially the return is very low or even negative. Therefore, as we continue to fuel the rapid growth, we will need to increase the number of people faster than the growth. We anticipate that ratio to improve when we reached critical mass of highly proficient business managers from the new hires.
 
Market and Supplier Development - Establishing a Vendor Acquisition Team
 
In order to continue growing at a rapid pace, we must onboard new vendors at scale. We anticipate establishing a vendor acquisition team dedicated to onboarding new vendors would drastically improve our vendor acquisition success rate. This team would specialize in the skills required to convince vendors to sell us their goods. Currently, this is being done by individual business managers with varying skill levels. The success rate by the individual business managers varies. Establishing this new team should ensure more consistency, so we can better plan for the future. The team would consist of three to five executive managers who are responsible for researching and contacting potential vendors. Furthermore, on a monthly basis, the team would be reviewing the lists of potential vendors who are not yet collaborating with us and reach out to them to reconnect. The objective of the vendor and supplier team is to on board 150 vendors per year and increasing our product range as well as diversifying our product categories.

COVID-19
 
Our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if a public health outbreak, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, interferes with our ability, or the ability of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, our ability to fund through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and through other means at acceptable terms, if at all, may be disrupted, in the event our financing needs for the foreseeable future are not able to be met by our balances of cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.
 
In addition, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental responses in the United States has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, including our ability to carry on business development activities, restrictions in business-related travel, delays or disruptions in our on-going projects, and unavailability of the employees of the Company or third parties with whom we conduct business, due to illness or quarantines, among others. Our business was negatively impacted by disruptions in our supply chain, which limited our ability to source merchandise, and limits on products fulfillment placed by Amazon. For example, we may be unable to launch new products, replenish inventory for existing products, ship into or receive inventory in our third-party warehouses in each case on a timely basis or at all. The extent to which COVID-19 could impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, and will depend on many factors, including the duration of the outbreak, the effect of travel restrictions and social distancing efforts in the United States and other countries, the scope and length of business closures or business disruptions, and the actions taken by governments to contain and treat the disease. As such, we cannot presently predict the scope and extent of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. Possible effects may include, but are not limited to, disruption to our customers and revenue, absenteeism in our labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in our operations, shutdowns that may be mandated or requested by governmental authorities, and a decline in the value of our assets, including various long-lived assets.
 
Bank of America Loan
 
On June 18, 2019, the Company issued a Promissory Note (the “BofA Note”) in the amount of $785,000 to Bank of America (the “Lender”) for a loan in the amount of $785,000. The BofA Note matures on June 18, 2024 and bears interest at a rate of 8.11% per annum. The monthly payment is $15,963, consisting of $11,398 of principal and $4,565 of interest.

On April 7, 2020, the Company issued a Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of $27,012 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted March 27, 2020, provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The Note matures on April 7, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 0.98% per annum, payable monthly commencing October 5, 2020, following an initial deferral period as specified under the PPP loan. The Note may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “Flexibility Act”), signed on June 5, 2020, amended certain provisions of the PPP, including the deferral period and repayment terms. The Flexibility Act extends the deferral period of payments of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees to the date when the U.S. Small Business Administration makes a final decision on the borrower’s application for forgiveness, or 10 months after the last day of the covered period if a borrower has not applied for forgiveness (whichever is earlier). This extension applies regardless of the terms of the PPP and does not require an amendment of the PPP. As such, the Company has not made any payments on the Note during 2020.
 
Under the terms of the PPP loan, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent PPP loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP loan. On May 6, 2021, the entire amount of principal and accrued interest on the Note was forgiven.
