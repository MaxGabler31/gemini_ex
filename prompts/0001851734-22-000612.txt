ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report, “we”, “us”, “our”, “FitLife”, “FitLife Brands”, the “Company” or “our company” refers to FitLife Brands, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
FitLife Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) is a national provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health-conscious consumers marketed under the following brand names: (i) NDS Nutrition, PMD Sports, SirenLabs, CoreActive, Nutrology, and Metis Nutrition (together, “NDS Products”); and (ii) iSatori, BioGenetic Laboratories, and Energize (together, the "iSatori Products"). The Company distributes the NDS Products principally through franchised General Nutrition Centers, Inc. (“GNC”) stores located both domestically and internationally, and, with the launch of Metis Nutrition, through corporate GNC stores in the United States. The iSatori Products are sold through more than 17,000 retail locations, which include specialty, mass, and online.
 
FitLife Brands is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. For more information on the Company, please go to www.fitlifebrands.com. The Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), trades under the symbol “FTLF” on the OTC Pink market.
 
Recent Developments
 
Forward Stock Split
 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved a forward stock split of the Company’s authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a ratio of 4-for-1 (the “Forward Split”). The Forward Split was effective as of December 2, 2021 and began trading on such basis on December 8, 2021. Prior to the Forward Split, the Company was authorized to issue 15.0 million shares of Common Stock. As a result of the Forward Split, the Company is now authorized to issue 60.0 million shares of Common Stock. The Forward Split did not have any effect on the stated par value of the Common Stock and did not affect the Company’s authorized preferred stock.
 
All references in this Annual Report to number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the Forward Split on a retroactive basis as of the earliest period presented, unless otherwise noted.
 
Nutrology Asset Purchase
 
On April 7, 2021, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Triple Impact Corporation, a New Jersey corporation doing business as Nutrology, a nutritional supplement company catering to consumers who prioritize all-natural and plant-based nutritional supplements. See Note 3 for additional detail regarding the acquisition.
Tax Benefits Preservation Plan
 
On February 26, 2021, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2021 (the “Record Date”). Each Right entitles its holder, under the circumstances described below, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series B Preferred”), at an exercise price of $100.00 per Right, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the tax benefits preservation plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”), dated as of February 26, 2021, between the Company and Colonial Stock, as rights agent (and any successor rights agent, the “Rights Agent”).

The Company adopted the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in order to protect shareholder value against a possible limitation on the Company’s ability to use its Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) and certain other tax benefits to reduce potential future U.S. federal income tax obligations. The NOLs are a valuable asset to the Company, which may inure to the benefit of the Company and its stockholders. However, if the Company experiences an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), its ability to fully utilize the NOLs and certain other tax benefits will be substantially limited and the timing of the usage of the NOLs and such other benefits could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of those assets. Generally, an “ownership change” occurs if the percentage of the Company’s stock owned by one or more of its “five-percent shareholders” (as such term is defined in Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholder or stockholders at any time over a three-year period. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to prevent against such an “ownership change” by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company’s securities.  Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan expired by its terms on March 1, 2022 and is no longer in effect.
 
Share Repurchase Plan

On February 1, 2021, the Board approved an additional amendment to the authorized share repurchase program initially approved by the Board on August 16, 2019, as amended on September 23, 2019 and November 6, 2019 (“Share Repurchase Program”). Under the terms of the amendment, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $5.0 million of the Company's Common Stock, warrants to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock ("Warrants"), and other securities issued by the Company ("Securities") over the next 24 months at a purchase price, in the case of Common Stock, equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of purchase, and in the case of Warrants and Securities, at a purchase price determined by management, with the exact date and amount of such purchases to be determined by management.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 36,092 shares of Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Program. The Company also purchased 50,840 dilutive in-the-money options from employees at a discount to their intrinsic value for total consideration of $184,000.

COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on the Company’s employees, business and operations and those of its customers, vendors and business partners. In this respect, the temporary or permanent closure of some of our retail partners’ store locations and the stay-at-home orders that occurred early in the pandemic negatively affected our results from operations, although much of the impact has been offset by an increase in revenue attributable to online sales, and increased sales during the more recent quarters. Our future financial position and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event that a resurgence of COVID-19 cases leads to new stay-at-home orders and/or further disruptions in both our supply chain and manufacturing lead-times, which could lower demand for the Company’s products and/or prevent the Company from producing and delivering its products in a timely manner, although the extent of these effects cannot be determined at this time. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and intends to make adjustments to its business and operations accordingly.

CARES Act
 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. On April 27, 2020, the Company received proceeds from a loan in the amount of $449,700 from its lender, CIT Bank, N.A. (the “PPP Lender”), pursuant to approval by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) for the PPP Lender to fund the Company’s request for a loan under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Loan”) created as part of the CARES ACT administered by the SBA (the “Loan Agreement”). In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Company used the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs, covered rent payments, and covered utilities during the eight-week period commencing on the date of loan approval. The PPP Loan was scheduled to mature on April 27, 2022, had a 1.0% interest rate, and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to all loans made pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program as administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The Company was informed by the PPP Lender and the SBA that the full balance of the PPP Loan, including accrued interest, was forgiven on January 15, 2021.
 
Industry Overview
 
We compete principally in the nutrition industry. The Nutrition Business Journal categorizes the industry in the following segments:
 

● | Natural & Organic Foods (products such as cereals, milk, non-dairy beverages and frozen meals);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Functional Foods (products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natural & Organic Personal Care and Household Products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supplements (products focused on sports nutrition and weight management).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Management believes that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry:
 

● | The general public’s awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The aging population in the Company’s markets who tend to use more nutritional supplements as they age;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing healthcare costs and the consequential trend toward preventative medicine and non-traditional medicines; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product introductions in response to new scientific studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
All of the Company’s products are manufactured by FDA-regulated contract manufacturers within the United States and Canada. Each contract manufacturer is required by the Company to abide by current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to ensure quality and consistency, and to manufacture its products according to the Company’s strict specifications, and nearly all our contract manufacturers are certified through a governing body such as the NPA (“Natural Products Association”) or NSF International. In most cases, contract manufacturers purchase the raw materials based on the Company’s specifications; however, from time to time, the Company will license particular raw material ingredients and supply its own source to the manufacturer. Once produced, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, the Company may also perform independent analysis and testing. The contract manufacturer either ships the finished product to one of our fulfillment centers or directly to our customers. The Company has implemented vendor qualification programs for all of its suppliers and manufacturers, including analytical testing of purchased products. As part of the vendor program, the Company also periodically inspects vendors’ facilities to monitor quality control and assurance procedures.

Product Reformulations and New Product Identification
 
From time to time we reformulate existing products to address market developments and trends, and to respond to customer requests. We also continually expand our product line through the development of new products. New product ideas are derived from a number of sources including trade publications, scientific and health journals, consultants, distributors, and other third parties. Prior to reformulating existing products or introducing new products, we investigate product formulations as they relate to regulatory compliance and other issues. We introduced a total of 15 new products during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included 4 completely new products, and 11 product reformulations and flavor extensions, and 32 new products during the year ended December 31, 2020, which included 12 completely new products, and 20 product reformulations and flavor extensions.
 
Management continually assesses and analyzes developing market trends to detect and proactively address what they believe are areas of unmet or growing demand that represent an opportunity for the Company and, where deemed appropriate, attempt to introduce new products and/or packaging solutions in direct response to meet that demand.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
NDS Products
 
NDS Products are sold through more than 750 GNC franchise locations located throughout the United States. The Company also distributes NDS Products to additional franchise locations in other countries. On May 1, 2014, the Company transitioned the majority of its distribution of NDS Products to GNC’s centralized distribution platform for all NDS Products, excluding protein products, which transitioned in mid-September 2014. Prior to the change, the majority of the Company’s revenue was realized upon direct shipment of NDS Products to individual franchise locations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the majority of NDS Product sales were through GNC’s centralized distribution platform.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand sales of NDS Products to additional GNC franchise locations both domestically and internationally. In addition, we have recently relaunched our Core Active brand as a new online-exclusive brand. The GNC domestic franchise market remains the core of our operations. Management is committed to continue to work collaboratively with GNC and its franchisees to build on our established track record of growth and innovation.
 
iSatori Products
 
iSatori Products are distributed directly to consumers through the Company's own websites and through other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), as well as through the specialty, drug and mass-market distribution channels. iSatori products are currently sold in over 17,000 retail locations.
 
In some cases, iSatori utilizes independent brokers, who work in conjunction with iSatori’s experienced sales employees and management to oversee the drug and mass-market channels. iSatori sells its products to mass-market merchandisers either directly or through distributors of nutritional supplement products. In addition to the Company’s online distribution channels for direct-to-consumer sales, major iSatori customers include CVS, GNC, Rite Aid, Vitamin Shoppe, Walgreens and Wal-Mart.
 
iSatori’s core strategy is to build and strengthen brands among consumers seeking nutritional supplement products with a reputation for quality and innovation. iSatori utilizes social media campaigns, coupons, and online advertising, plus cooperative and other incentive programs, to build consumer awareness and generate trial and repeat purchases to drive sales revenue. Our marketing team regularly reviews the media mix for its effectiveness in creating consumer demand and the highest return on investment dollars.

Product Returns
 
We currently have a 30-day product return policy for NDS Products, which allows for a 100% sales price refund for the return of unopened and undamaged products purchased from us online through one of our websites. Product sold to GNC may be returned from store shelves or the distribution center in the event the product is damaged, short dated, expired or recalled. GNC maintains a customer satisfaction program that allows customers to return product to the store for credit or refund. Subject to certain terms and restrictions, GNC may require reimbursement from vendors for unsaleable returned product through either direct payment or credit against a future invoice. We also support a product return policy for iSatori Products, whereby customers can return product for credit or refund. Product returns can and do occur from time to time and can be material.
Competition
 
The nutrition industry is highly competitive, and the Company has many competitors that sell products similar to the Company’s products. Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. The Company seeks to differentiate its products and marketing from its competitors based on product quality, benefits, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that protect brands, product names, and new technologies are pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of the consumer will enable the Company to effectively compete in the marketplace.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various agencies of the states and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:

● | product claims and advertising;
--+--------------------------------


● | product labels;
--+----------------


● | product ingredients; and
--+-------------------------


● | how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell, and store our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet cGMPs to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated cGMPs.
 
The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following:
 

● | the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  -6- 

  


● | labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements, and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status.
 
DSHEA also permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for nutritional supplements without FDA premarket approval. These statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that includes the following: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” These statements may describe a benefit related to a nutrient deficiency disease, the role of a nutrient or nutritional ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or the general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a nutritional supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. An entity that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we will be prevented from using the claim. 
 
In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature”, for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA. 
 
In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (“DSNDCPA”) was passed, which further revised the provisions of the FDCA. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and are required to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DSNDCPA.
 
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment, and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so.
 
  -7- 

  

Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on the reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. Similar to the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products, and thus, materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
 
The Company regards intellectual property, including its trademarks, service marks, website URLs (domains) and other proprietary rights, as valuable assets and part of its brand equity. The Company believes that protecting such intellectual property is crucial to its business strategy. The Company pursues registration of the registrable trademarks, service marks and patents, associated with its key products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other places it distributes its products.
 
The Company formulates its products using proprietary ingredient formulations, flavorings and delivery systems. To further protect its product formulations and flavors, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers that provide exclusivity to certain products formulations and delivery technologies. When appropriate, the Company will seek to protect its research and development efforts by filing patent applications for proprietary product technologies or ingredient combinations. We have abandoned or not pursued efforts to register certain other patents and marks identifying other items in our product line for various reasons, including the inability of some names to qualify for registration or patent applications to qualify for patent protection, and due to our abandonment of certain such products. All trademark registrations are protected for a period of ten years and then are renewable thereafter if still in use.
 
Employees
 
We had 25 and 23 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Company retains consultants for certain services on an as-needed basis. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We have not incurred any costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations, nor do we anticipate any future costs associated with environmental compliance; however, no assurances can be given that we will not incur such costs in the future.
