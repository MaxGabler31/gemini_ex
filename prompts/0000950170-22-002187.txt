Item 1. Business
Company Overview

We are a leading diversified media company with television broadcasting, television network and digital media assets operating in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 199 full power television stations and one AM radio station, including those television stations owned by VIEs, in 116 markets in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MyNetworkTV (“MNTV”) and other broadcast television networks. As of December 31, 2021, we reached approximately 39% of all U.S. television households (after applying the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) ultra-high-frequency (“UHF”) discount). We also own NewsNation (formerly WGN America), a live daily national news and general entertainment cable network which is distributed to approximately 75 million homes as of December 31, 2021 according to The Nielsen Company (US), LLC (“Nielsen”), two digital multicast networks and other multicast network services, and a 31.3% ownership stake in Television Food Network, G.P. (“TV Food Network”). Our digital assets include 120 local websites and 284 mobile applications, national digital properties including NewsNation, The Hill, BestReviews and a suite of advertiser solutions. Together, our other digital properties attracted over 120 million unique visitors in December 2021 according to Comscore.

The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free programming to our markets’ television viewing audiences. This programming includes programs produced by third party networks with which the stations are affiliated, programs that the stations produce, and first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our NewsNation cable network delivers a growing national newscast and quality television series and movies. Our primary sources of revenue include the sale of commercial air time on our stations to local advertisers, the sale of commercial airtime on our stations and cable network to national advertisers, the sale of advertising on our stations’ websites and mobile applications where we deliver community focused content, and the revenues our stations and cable network generate from retransmission consent and carriage agreements with traditional multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and satellite providers, and online video distributors (“OVDs”), companies that provide video content through internet streaming.

Our digital businesses include video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third-party websites and mobile applications, a consumer product reviews platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers. We are focused on growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms.
 
At the station level, we seek to grow our revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations’ strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve station cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by owning or providing services to stations affiliated with multiple networks, capitalizing on our local sales force in each market and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. We also seek continued increase in the consumer awareness and viewership of our NewsNation cable network and continued growth in our portfolio of digital products, services and content.
 
More broadly, we seek to grow by using our scale and platform to provide advertisers with solutions across geographies and media types, leveraging costs against a broader platform and acquiring or investing in businesses that can benefit from our scale and asset mix.
 
We derive significant cash flows from our largest equity investment, a 31.3% interest in TV Food Network. TV Food Network operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, as well as their related websites. Food Network is a fully distributed network in the United States with content distributed internationally. Cooking Channel is a digital-tier network available nationally and airs popular off-Food Network programming as well as originally produced programming. We also own attractive real estate in key markets, including development rights for certain of our real estate assets.
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1996. Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv. The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.
 

Recent Acquisition
 On August 20, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of News Communications, Inc. (“NCI”) for a total cash consideration of approximately $137.7 million, including working capital adjustments, funded by cash on hand. NCI is the owner of “The Hill,” an independent, political digital media platform. This acquisition marks a continuation of Nexstar’s content-first strategy, focused primarily on news, designed to further leverage and monetize our expansive digital reach.
 See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the above transaction.
 Operating Strategy
We seek to generate revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow growth through the following strategies:
Leverage Our Scale. We believe we are the largest local broadcasting company in the United States, generating $4.648 billion of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our television stations reach approximately 68% of U.S. television households (without applying the FCC UHF discount), which reach is augmented by the additional households that have access to NewsNation or our other multicast networks. We believe we are one of the largest affiliate groups for each of our major broadcast network partners. We are an important partner for the MVPDs and OVDs which include our content in their consumer offerings. Our digital assets attract an audience that makes us a top ten digital news and information property and a top 30 property overall for December 2021, according to Comscore. Our scale provides us with unique operating advantages in the form of services we can provide to our advertisers, audience and employees, a platform for growth and operating expense synergies and access to capital.
 Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. According to Comscore, in over 76% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company earned approximately 44% of its advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to typically provide between 15 and 40 hours per week of local news programming, but as high as 80 hours per week at stations with enhanced time periods for local news. Extensive local sports coverage, active sponsorship of community events and the local news stories our Washington, D.C. bureau focuses on further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal.
Invest in Digital Media. According to an October 2021 eMarketer report, digital advertising spending accounts for more than 60% of all media advertising spending and is projected to grow at a 12% compound annual growth rate over the next four years. Nexstar has a large digital audience with its local and national websites attracting approximately 91 million average unique monthly users utilizing nearly eight billion page views and 687 million video views during 2021. For December 31, 2021, our digital properties attracted approximately 120 million unique users and ranked as a top 10 digital news and information property according to Comscore. Additionally, we reach our audiences through all social platforms and syndication of our content to third parties. We generate digital advertising revenues from the sale of direct and programmatic advertising on our owned and operated websites, the sale of digital marketing solutions provided to local and national advertisers and affiliate marketing as part of our consumer product reviews platform. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, only 6.9% of our net revenue was generated from digital advertising. We are focused on better monetizing our digital audience and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content and associated revenue streams. In 2021, we launched STELLAR, our unified digital platform that enables advertisers to increase customer acquisition and deliver effective omni-channel advertising campaigns. In 2020 and 2021 we acquired a digital consumer product reviews platform and a digital political news platform, respectively, which increased our digital revenue streams.
 Emphasize Core and Political Advertising Sales. Our core revenue is comprised of advertising time sales to local and national customers. in 2021, we generated 37.9% of our revenue from core advertising. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may also advertise locally).
 

In even-number years, when most local and national elections are held, we historically have generated substantial revenue from political advertising. Given our diverse and expansive geographic reach, we have television stations in the substantial majority of markets where there have been contested political elections. We are focused on growing our market share of political advertising spending.
 
Continue to Increase Distribution Revenues. We generated 53.2% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from distribution fees paid to us by MVPDs and OVDs for retransmission of our content. We believe that the share of audience that our content generates for MVPDs and OVDs is greater than the share of fees those platforms pay us. In 2021, our Distribution Revenue grew 14.9%. We anticipate we will continue to be able to grow this revenue category.
 Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations. We currently own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, CW and MNTV affiliated stations, which represented approximately 11.5%, 20.3%, 20.9%, 24.0%, 13.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of our 2021 combined core (local and national) and political advertising net revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NFL football, NBA basketball, Major League Baseball, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network programming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio’s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network.
 
Operate and Expand NewsNation. In September 2020, we successfully launched NewsNation, a live daily national news network. The cable network draws on the local market, regional and national expertise of Nexstar’s 5,500 local journalists. In 2021, in addition to its prime time national newscast (NewsNationPrime), NewsNation successfully launched additional programs, including Morning in America, Rush Hour, The Donlon Report, On Balance, Dan Abrams Live and Banfield.
Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 55% of our stations’ net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from our duopoly markets.
Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase EBITDA and free cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units, and our overall size benefits each station or business unit with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units.
Develop New Revenue Streams. We seek to generate new revenue streams leveraging the platform and assets of our company. Given our extensive station portfolio and geographic coverage, we have begun to convert the technology used by our stations to a new standard, ATSC 3.0, which will enable us to provide new high speed data transmission services to businesses and consumers. In 2021, we upgraded our stations in 17 markets expanding our reach to approximately 29% of all U.S. television households with the plan to convert another 20 markets in 2022, bringing our total coverage of the U.S. to approximately 50%. We anticipate that this conversion will enable us to develop a new business and generate additional revenue in the future.
 Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain business unit and station general managers with proven track records by providing equity incentives.



Acquisition Strategy

We selectively pursue acquisitions where we believe we can improve revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow through active management. We selectively pursue acquisitions of content-driven businesses that leverage our platform, scale and capabilities and are complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment, and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms. In addition, we will continue to pursue television station acquisitions in markets where permitted by the current regulatory framework.

Relationship with VIEs
 Through various local service agreements, as of December 31, 2021, we provided sales, programming and other services to 35 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2021, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs’ stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under the senior secured credit facility of Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (“Mission”), a consolidated VIE, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of all of the consolidated VIEs’ stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2022 and 2031. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements.
 For additional information on VIEs, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background
Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by Nielsen, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as DMAs, that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates.
Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs.
Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, MVPDs, OVDs, Google, Facebook and other online media, newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations.
Advertising Sales
General
Television station revenue is derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks, which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming.
Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station’s local sales staff.
Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including:
•a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target; 
 •the number of advertisers competing for the available time; 
 •the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station; 
 •the availability of alternative advertising media in the market; 
 •the effectiveness of the station’s sales force; 
 •development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and 
 •the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser. 
 Advertising rates are also determined by a station’s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station’s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations.


The NewsNation cable network also sells national advertising, with pricing based on audience size, demographics and the number of advertisers competing for available commercial time.
 Seasonality
Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the Olympic Games.
Core Advertising Sales
Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel.
National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may also advertise locally).
Distribution Revenue
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OVDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations and the carriage of NewsNation. Distribution revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and OVDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with these distributors have created agreements that produce meaningful recurring revenue streams.
 Network Affiliations
Except for WGN-TV, WDVM and KAUT, all of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to are currently affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The agreements with ABC, FOX, NBC, and CBS are the most significant to our operations. The current terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

NetworkAffiliations | Expiration Date 
ABC | 29 agreements expire in December 2022. 
FOX | Of the 42 agreements, 41 expire in August 2023 and one(1) expires in December 2023.
NBC | 35 agreements expire in December 2024. 
CBS | 49 agreements expire in June 2024(2). 
The CW | 23 agreements expire in August 2023. 
MNTV | 18 agreements expire in September 2023. 

(1)This affiliation agreement is owned by a station to which we provide sales and other services. We do not consolidate this station in our financial statements due to lack of a deemed controlling financial interest.
 (2)Reflects the current affiliation agreements in place with CBS as of January 2022. 
 
Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees from us and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.
 

Investments
 We derive significant cash flows from our largest equity method investment, a 31.3% interest in TV Food Network, which operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, as well as their related websites. During 2021, we received cash distributions from TV Food Network totaling $239.5 million. Our partner in TV Food Network is Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”), which owns a 68.7% interest in TV Food Network and operates the networks on behalf of the partnership. Food Network programming content attracts audiences interested in food-related entertainment, including competition and travel, as well as food-related topics such as recipes, food preparation, entertaining, and dining out. Food Network engages audiences by creating original programming that is entertaining, instructional and informative. Food Network is a fully distributed network in the United States with content distributed internationally. Cooking Channel is an entertainment brand dedicated to today's passionate food lover. For food people, by food people, Cooking Channel is the answer to a growing hunger for more content devoted to food and cooking in every dimension from global cuisines to international travel, history and unconventional how-to's. Cooking Channel is a digital-tier network available nationally and airs popular off-Food Network programming as well as originally produced programming.
Competition
Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 Audience. We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station’s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to provide their programming directly to the consumer via streaming services, which present an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include the internet, gaming devices, home entertainment systems, video-on-demand and pay-per-view.
 While the commercial television broadcast industry continues to generate a significant percentage of viewership from the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other cable television networks and video streaming services command significant audiences.
 NewsNation, our growing national news channel, competes with other established national newscasts such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC for viewers. NewsNation’s entertainment programming also competes for viewers with other distribution technologies.
 Programming. Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and off-network rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators, cable network and streaming services for exclusive access to off-network reruns and first-run product in their respective markets. Comcast Corporation, Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS), CBS, Fox Corporation and The Walt Disney Company each own a major television network and multiple cable networks and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary sources of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved from or to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events.
Advertising. Our stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as online media (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.), OVDs, MVPDs, radio stations, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and direct mail, among others. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. Our national newscast cable network also competes for advertising revenue with other advertising media and with other established national networks such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC.
 


The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. An increase in the popularity of OVDs may result in popular product offerings that do not include television broadcast stations. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services.
Federal Regulation
Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies.
License Grant and Renewal.  The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application.
In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture.
Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC’s processing of a timely renewal application. We initiated the license renewal process for our stations in June 2020 and will continue these filings through April 2023.
 Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval.
Foreign Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. The FCC will entertain and may authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees.

Multiple Ownership Restrictions. The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of television broadcast stations in local markets and nationally. These ownership limits apply to “attributable interests” in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar.
 The FCC multiple ownership rules currently applicable to television broadcasters are summarized below:
 
 Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) after the combination at least one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA in terms of audience share (although the FCC may determine, on a case-by-case basis upon a sufficient showing, that the public interest would not be served by enforcing this “top four” prohibition). The duopoly rule also allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station, where otherwise prohibited, where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt.

 In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC’s duopoly rule and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations.

 In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to an exemption under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station. Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is “failing.” We also own two “top four” stations in the Indianapolis, Indiana market pursuant to an FCC determination that prohibition of such ownership would not serve the public interest.
     National Television Ownership Limit. The FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39%. When calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of a UHF station is counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a proceeding to broadly reexamine its national television ownership rule, including the percentage reach cap and the so-called “UHF discount.” Comments and reply comments in this proceeding were filed in 2018, and the proceeding remains open.
 
 The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of approximately 39% of all U.S. television households (applying the FCC’s UHF discount).
 
 Attribution of Local Service Agreements. The FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a TBA or LMA, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. We provide more than 15% of a non-owned station’s programming under a TBA or LMA in six markets. In five of these markets—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island—the TBAs or LMAs were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise. Our LMA with Mission for WPIX in New York is not attributable because we do not own a station in that market and do not have any equity or debt interests in Mission.
 
 Under current FCC rules, our JSAs and SSAs with independently owned same-market stations are non-attributable. We may therefore retain our existing JSA and SSAs in effect and enter into new ones, but we must publicly disclose them, and the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements.


 Quadrennial Review of Media Ownership Rules. The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and to eliminate those rules it finds are no longer “necessary in the public interest as a result of competition.” The FCC’s two most recent quadrennial reviews—those for 2010 and 2014—were eventually consolidated into a single proceeding that involved extensive litigation, an agency reconsideration and multiple court appeals, culminating in an April 1, 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court which upheld the FCC’s elimination or relaxation of several rules. The 2018 quadrennial review, which the FCC commenced in December 2018, remains pending, and the FCC has recently solicited and received comments to update the record of that proceeding in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision. The FCC has not yet initiated the required 2022 proceeding.
      MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.” Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2023 and will be effective January 1, 2024. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.
     A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.
     FCC rules and federal statutory law require retransmission consent negotiations to be conducted in “good faith.” It is a per se violation of the duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under this rule, stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned station in the same DMA; or (2) if located in the same DMA and not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs for stations in markets where we also own a station.
    MVPD operators have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. There are still-open FCC proceedings to review the “totality of the circumstances” test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations, and to eliminate or modify the FCC’s non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules (which could permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances).
     The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals.
    Certain OVDs have successfully or unsuccessfully sought to stream broadcast programming over the internet. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD’s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate federal copyright law. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term “MVPD” to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. The proceeding remains open. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, a number of OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements.
     The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations’ signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements, will negotiate agreements with OVDs.


Human Capital Management
 Values. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and provide services. We encourage every individual’s contributions and personal growth and foster work environments that provide personal pride through job satisfaction and a balanced life. We embrace the communities in which we operate and promote open communications, innovation and creativity.
Engagement and Opportunities. With markets ranging from small to large, we offer a broad range of opportunities for every experience level, including for those who are just starting their broadcasting career or are ready to make the leap into a larger market. Our market diversity allows us to give our employees room to grow and progress in their careers. Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. As of December 31, 2021, our voluntary retention rate for employees was approximately 78%. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Our employee wages are competitive and consistent with employee positions, experience, knowledge and location. In addition, in 2019, the Company initiated a company-wide minimum wage above the federal requirement, which has been increased effective January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Annual wage increases and incentive payments are based on merit and are communicated to employees as a part of the annual review process. In January 2022, we also enhanced our parental leave and short-term disability programs, including the adoption of up to six weeks of paid leave for eligible employees regardless of gender, offering birth mothers to take paid parental leave in addition to using short-term disability benefits and increasing the maximum weekly short-term disability benefit paid to employees by 100%.
 Community Outreach. At Nexstar, we pride ourselves on the opportunities we provide for our employees to give back to their communities. On our 20th anniversary in June 2016, we organized our inaugural Founders Day of Caring, an employee driven effort focused on local non-profits and charities. Our employees fanned out across the country to contribute thousands of hours of community services. Founders Day has continued to be a success for our employees and their communities, with a pause in 2020. We resumed our Founders Day activities in 2021 and such initiatives provided 15,198 hours of service in one day to the Company’s communities.
 Diversity and Inclusion.  We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion so all of our employees feel respected and none of them feels discriminated against. In 2020, we launched our Diversity and Inclusion Council, a working committee dedicated to creating a path toward a more diverse and inclusive workplace, where diverse talent can flourish and build a career. The Council is comprised of ten members from throughout the Company, with membership changing periodically. In 2020, the Council initiated our Employee Resource Groups and established a model mentorship program that rolled out Company-wide. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment of unique perspectives. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 41% and 40% of our employees and our management, respectively, were women. In the U.S., approximately 29% and 25% of our employees and our management, respectively, were racially/ethnically diverse. In order to ensure accountability in making progress in our diversity goals, a portion of our managers’ bonuses are tied to diversity metrics in their markets. In addition, we have implemented Employee Resource Groups in the categories of Latinx, Women, African American, Veterans and LGBTQ+. These groups are designed to bring together employees who share similar cultures, backgrounds, and/or interests, as well as those employees who wish to provide support to that group.
Training and Mentorship. We are committed to developing the talents of our employees. We have partnered with Everfi, a leading provider of online workplace training, to deliver engaging and compelling content to all employees. Our catalog of courses includes harassment prevention, diversity/equity/inclusion, ethics, managing bias, supervisor/manager skills, and most recently, COVID-19 safety. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, our Corporate Human Resources team conducted a successful pilot for a new mentorship program that was launched company-wide in 2021. The program matches mentors and mentees across the company and provides the pairs with a 12-topic curriculum covering skills such as communications, networking, work/life balance, and goal setting. In late 2021, to improve the experience of participants, the program was moved to MentorCity, an intuitive online cloud-based Mentoring platform.
In 2018, Nexstar settled a U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division investigation, as did a number of other television broadcasting companies. Nexstar did not admit any wrongdoing but, as a part of the settlement agreement, it agreed to take certain actions, including providing training programs to all officers and sales related employees, to ensure they understand the antitrust laws, how those laws apply to Nexstar and our employees and to help them spot common patterns that may implicate antitrust laws.
Nexstar sales employees also participate in a media sales training program provided by The Center for Sales Strategy, a third-party vendor.
 

Safety and COVID-19 Response. We value our employees and are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. All employees are required to comply with our safety rules and are expected to actively contribute to making our company a safer place to work. In response to COVID-19, we implemented remote working for many of our employees. Our work locations developed and implemented their own plans for staffing during the pandemic, with a focus on reducing headcounts within our facilities to reduce the risk for those employees whose job functions could not be performed remotely, and in compliance with applicable state and local safety requirements and protocols. Currently, a majority of our workforce have returned to working in a facility under strong safety protocols. In allowing additional employees to return to our facilities, we considered and continue to consider guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, other health organizations, federal, state and local governmental authorities, and our customers, among others. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers.
 Employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 12,473 employees, comprised of 11,160 full-time and 1,313 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2021, 1,714 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
