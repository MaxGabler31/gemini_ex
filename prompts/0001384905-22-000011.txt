ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading provider of global enterprise cloud communications, video meetings, collaboration, and contact center software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions. We believe that our innovative, cloud-based communication and contact center solutions disrupt the large market for business communications and collaboration by providing flexible and cost-effective solutions that support mobile and distributed workforces. We enable convenient and effective communications for organizations across all their locations and employees, enabling them to be more productive and responsive.
Our cloud-based solutions are designed to be easy to use, providing a global user identity across devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones. Our solutions can be deployed rapidly and configured and managed easily. Our cloud-based solutions are location and device independent and better suited to address the needs of modern mobile and global enterprise workforces than are legacy on-premise systems. Through our open Application Programming Interface (API) platform, we enable third-party developers and customers to integrate our solution with leading business applications to customize their own business workflows.
The rapid growth of mobile communications has changed the way businesses interact. Employees connect from anywhere with any device, using multiple modes of communications including messaging, video, phone, text, and social media. These forms of flexible communications enable employees to be productive in ways that traditional on-premise systems do not support.
We believe RingCentral benefits from both the shift to mobile and distributed workforces and the migration of hardware on-premise based communication systems to cloud-based software solutions. Our cloud communications and contact center solutions are based on our Message Video Phone (MVP) platform, which has been designed from the ground up, specifically for today’s mobile and distributed workforce. In addition, our differentiated open API platform enables seamless integration with third-party and custom software applications. These integrations improve business workflows resulting in higher employee productivity and better customer service. Our global delivery capabilities support the needs of multi-national enterprises in multiple countries. 
We offer three key products in our portfolio, including:
•RingCentral MVP (formerly RingCentral Office), a Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) platform, including team messaging, video meetings, and a cloud phone system;
•RingCentral customer engagement solutions, including RingCentral cloud Contact Center as a Service (“CCaaS”), RingCentral Engage Digital and Voice; and
•RingCentral Video (formerly Glip), launched in 2020, our branded video meeting solution with team messaging that enables smart video meetings.
We generate revenues primarily from the sale of subscriptions for our cloud-based services. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers, adding value to their experience, and increasing their use of our solutions. As their needs change, customers add users to services, upgrade to premium subscription editions which provide additional features and functionality and expand their use of other solutions. 
We continue to invest in our direct inside sales force while also developing indirect sales channels to market our brand and our subscription offerings. Our indirect sales channels who sell our solutions consist of:
•Regional and global network of resellers and distributors;
•Strategic partners who market and sell our solutions, including co-branded solutions. Such partnerships include Avaya Holding Corp. (“Avaya”), Atos SE (“Atos”), Unify Software and Solutions GmbH & CO. KG (“Unify”), and Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (“ALE”). In November 2021, we entered into a strategic partnership with Mitel US Holdings, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Mitel"). As part of this agreement, we became Mitel's exclusive UCaaS partner.
•Carriers including AT&T (“AT&T”), TELUS Communications Company (“TELUS”), BT Group plc (“BT”), Vodafone Group Services Limited (“Vodafone”), Verizon Business (“Verizon”), Deutsche Telekom (“DT”) and other regional carriers. In May 2021, we entered into a partnership with Verizon and launched a co-branded service, RingCentral with Verizon, an integrated unified UCaaS solution for enterprise businesses. In June 2021, we entered into a strategic partnership with DT to offer a co-branded version of RingCentral Video (“RCV”) as a stand-alone video solution and recently, we expanded our partnership with DT, to offer customers RingCentral X powered by Telekom, an end-to-end communications and collaboration solution.

Our Solutions
Our cloud-based business communications, collaboration, and customer engagement solutions function across multiple locations and devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, allow for communication across multiple modes, including high-definition (“HD”) voice, video, SMS, messaging and collaboration, conferencing, online meetings, and fax. Our proprietary solutions enable a more productive and dynamic workforce and are architected using industry standards to meet modern business communications and collaboration requirements, including workforce mobility, “bring-your-own” communications device environments and multiple communications methods.
Our solutions are delivered using a highly available, and rapidly and easily scalable infrastructure, allowing our customers to add new users regardless of where they are located within our service footprint and promote business continuity. Our solutions are generally affordable, requiring little to no upfront infrastructure hardware costs or ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs commonly associated with on-premise systems and can be integrated with other existing communication systems.
We believe that our solutions go beyond the core functionality of existing on-premise communications solutions by providing additional key benefits that address the changing requirements of business to allow business communications using voice, HD video web conferencing, SMS, team messaging, collaboration, fax, and social media. The key benefits of our solutions include:
•Location Independence.    Our cloud-based solutions are designed to be location independent. We seamlessly connect distributed and mobile users, enabling employees to communicate with a single identity whether working from a central location, a branch office, on the road, or at home.
•Global. Our RingCentral Global MVP capabilities support multinational enterprise workforces. RingCentral Global MVP connects multinational workforces globally, while reducing the complexity and high costs of maintaining multiple legacy private branch exchanges (“PBX systems”) with a single global cloud solution.
•Device Independence.    Our solutions are designed to work with a broad range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs, and desk phones, enabling businesses to successfully implement a “bring-your-own” communications device strategy.
•Instant Activation and Easy Account Management.    Our solutions are designed for rapid deployment and ease of management. Our intuitive graphical user interfaces allow administrators and users to set up and manage their business communications system with little or no IT expertise, training, or dedicated staffing.
•Analytics.    Our solutions enable superior user experience and drive business decisions through a single, real-time intuitive interface with configurable, out-of-the-box KPIs and metrics for monitoring all users, calls, meetings, devices, numbers, and queues, along with call quality scores and parameters.
•Scalability.    Our cloud-based solutions scale easily and efficiently with the growth of our customers. Customers can add users, regardless of their location, without having to purchase additional infrastructure hardware or software upgrades.
•Lower Cost of Ownership.    We believe that our customers experience significantly lower cost of ownership compared to legacy on-premise systems. Using our cloud-based solutions, our customers can avoid the significant upfront costs of infrastructure hardware, software, ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs, and the need for dedicated and trained IT personnel to support these systems.
•Seamless and Intuitive Integration with Other Applications.    Applications are proliferating within businesses of all sizes. Integration of these business applications with legacy on-premise systems is typically complex and expensive, which limits the ability of businesses to leverage cloud-based applications. Our platform provides seamless and intuitive integration with multiple popular cloud-based business applications such as Microsoft productivity and CRM tools, Google G-Suite, Salesforce CRM, Oracle, Okta, Zendesk, Box, and Workday, as well as customer lines-of business applications.
We have a portfolio of cloud-based offerings that are subscription-based and made available at different monthly rates, varying by the specific functionalities, services, and number of users. We primarily generate revenues from the sale of subscriptions of our offerings, which include the following:

Segment Reporting
Our organizational structure is a single reportable segment. A discussion of the results of our operations is included in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and in Part II, Item 8, “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Our Customers
We have a diverse and growing customer base across a wide range of industries, including financial services, education, healthcare, legal services, real estate, retail, technology, insurance, construction, hospitality, and state and local government, among others. We seek to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our customers. We do not have significant customer concentration and none of our customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. We believe that we will not have significant customer concentration in the future.
We sell our solutions to enterprise customers, and small and medium-sized businesses. We define a “customer” as a party that purchases or subscribes to our products and services directly or through our indirect sales channel, which includes resellers and distributors, strategic partners and carriers. We continuously expand our solution offering globally and believe that there are additional growth opportunities in international markets.
Marketing, Sales and Support
We use a variety of marketing, sales, and support activities to generate and cultivate ongoing customer demand for our subscriptions, acquire new customers, and engage with our existing customers. We sell globally through both direct and indirect channels, which includes resellers and distributors, strategic partners and carriers. We provide onboarding implementation services to help our customers set up and configure their newly purchased communications system, as well as ongoing self-
service, phone support, online chat support, and training. We also closely track and monitor customer acquisition costs to assess how we are deploying our marketing, sales, and customer support spending.
•Marketing.    Our marketing efforts include search engine marketing, search engine optimization, affiliates, list buys, shared leads, content leads, appointment setting, radio advertising, online display advertising, sports sponsorships, billboard advertising, tradeshows and events, and other forms of demand generation. We track and measure our marketing costs closely across all channels so that we can acquire customers in a cost-efficient manner.
•Direct Sales.    We primarily sell our solutions and subscriptions through direct inbound and outbound sales efforts. We have direct sales representatives located in the U.S. and internationally.
•Indirect Sales.    Our indirect sales channel consists of global and regional networks of resellers and distributors, strategic partners and global and regional carriers. Our indirect sales channels help broaden the adoption of our solutions and enables us to leverage their sales force to sell our services as well as access their customer bases.
•Customer Support and Services.    While our intuitive and easy-to-use user interface serves to reduce our customers’ need for support and services, we provide online chat and phone customer support, as well as post-sale implementation support, as an option to help customers configure and use our solution. We track and measure our customer satisfaction and our support costs closely across all channels to provide a high level of customer service in a cost-efficient manner.
Research and Development
We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to expanding our leadership position within the cloud-based business communications and collaboration solutions market and is a key element of our culture. We devote the majority of our research and development resources to software development. Our engineering team has significant experience in various disciplines related to our platform, such as voice, video, text, team messaging and collaboration, mobile application development, IP networking and infrastructure, contact center, digital customer engagement, user experience, security, and robust multi-tenant cloud-based system architecture.
Our development methodology, in combination with our SaaS delivery model, allows us to provide new and enhanced capabilities on a regular basis. Based on feedback from our customers and prospects and our review of the broader business communications and SaaS markets, we continuously develop new functionality while maintaining and enhancing our existing solutions. We typically have multiple releases per year, where we constantly improve our solutions and introduce new capabilities and features to make our customers’ workforce more productive and to build out the feature set required by larger and global enterprises.
As part of our strategy to expand our technological capabilities, we engage in strategic transactions from time to time. Such strategic acquisitions enable us to complement our technology and skill sets and expand our solution reach.
Technology and Operations
Our platforms are hosted both in private and public clouds. Our private clouds are built on a highly scalable and flexible infrastructure comprised of commercially available hardware and software components. We believe that both hardware and software components of our platform can be replaced, upgraded or added with minimal or no interruption in service. The system is designed to have no single point-of-failure.
Our private cloud is served from multiple data centers and third-party co-location facilities located in several cities in the United States and throughout the world. Our data centers are designed to host mission-critical computer and communications systems with redundant, fault-tolerant subsystems, and compartmentalized security zones. We maintain a security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to our customers’ data. We limit access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio includes over 774 issued patents, which expire between 2022 and 2041, and over 135 patent applications, pending examination in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are related to U.S. applications. In general, our patents and patent applications apply to certain aspects of our SaaS and mobile applications and underlying communications infrastructure. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our solutions and subscriptions.
Competition
The market for business communications and collaboration solutions is very large, rapidly evolving, complex, fragmented and defined by changing technology, and customer needs. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product features and capabilities;
•system reliability, availability, and performance;
•speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration;
•ownership and control of the underlying technology;
•open platform;
•integration with mobile devices;
•brand awareness and recognition;
•simplicity of the pricing model; and
•total cost of ownership.
We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above.
We face competition from a broad range of providers of business communications and collaboration solutions. Some of these competitors include:
•traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel Networks Corporation, NEC Corporation, and Siemens Enterprise Networks, LLC, any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud;
•software providers such as Microsoft Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc. that generally license and/or host their software solutions, and their resellers including major carriers and cable companies;
•established business communications providers that resell on-premise hardware, software, and hosted solutions, such as AT&T, BT, Comcast, Charter, COX, TMU, TELUS, Verizon Communications Inc., Vodafone Group Plc, DT, Orange, Telefonica, and others, all of whom currently have significantly greater resources than us and now or in the future also may develop and/or host their own or other solutions through the cloud;
•other cloud companies such as 8x8, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., DialPad, Inc., StarBlue, Inc., Intermedia.net, Inc., LogMeIn, Inc, Microsoft Corporation, Nextiva, Inc., Twilio Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp. (recently acquired by Ericsson), West Corporation, and Zoom Video Communications, Inc.;
•video meeting and collaboration service providers such as Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. (Google G-Suite and Meet), Facebook, Inc., Microsoft Teams, Slack Technologies, Inc. (acquired by salesforce.com, inc), and Zoom Video Communications, Inc.;
•other large internet companies such as Alphabet Inc. (Google Voice), Facebook, Inc., Oracle Corporation, and salesforce.com, inc., any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communication services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future;
•providers of communications platform as a service solutions and messaging software platforms with APIs such as Twilio Inc., Vonage Holding Corp. (recently acquired by Ericsson), and Slack Technologies, Inc. (acquired by salesforce.com, inc), on which customers can build diverse solutions by integrating cloud communications into business applications;
•contact center and customer relationship management providers such as Amazon.com, Inc., Aspect Software, Inc., Avaya Inc., Five9, Inc., NICE InContact, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., Serenova, LLC (acquired by Lifesize, Inc.), Talkdesk, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp. (recently acquired by Ericsson), salesforce.com, inc., Twilio Inc., and Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and
•digital engagement vendors such as eGain Corporation, Lithium Technologies, LLC, LivePerson, Inc., SparkCentral Inc. (acquired by Hootsuite Inc.), among others named above that may offer similar features.
Employees and Human Capital
We believe that our culture and our workforce are critically important to our success. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. We continuously invest in our global workforce by seeking to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where our employees can learn, innovate, and deliver their best. We are committed to being inclusive to enable our workforce and customers to succeed.
We invest in developing our talent and creating a superior employee experience. We believe that a highly engaged workforce will continue to drive RingCentral’s competitive advantage as an innovative company and will also keep RingCentral as an employer of choice. We believe that our approach to talent development and innovation enables our team members to grow in their current positions and build new skills. We provide virtual and in-person interactive learning courses across a broad range of categories such as leadership, inclusion and diversity, technical and compliance, among others. We have periodic employee surveys that allow employees to voice their perceptions of the Company and their work experience. 
Our diversity and inclusion initiatives honor the unique background, identity and perspectives of each individual in our organization and we are committed to the success of our workforce and customers. We continue to drive key initiatives in talent acquisition and talent management to focus on increasing the representation of women and underrepresented groups in our global workforce. We received recognition for our initiatives in the area of diversity, equity and inclusiveness, wherein our CEO was recognized as the “Best CEO for Women” and “Diversity” by Comparably in 2021. We encourage and support employee resource groups like our LGBTQ+ group, Black employees group and Pan-Asian group, among others. We continue to look for ways to further expand our efforts in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion.
We face competition for highly skilled and technical workforce with experience in our industry and locations where we maintain offices. We strive to provide competitive pay, benefits, and services to attract and retain our employees. Our equity and cash incentive plans are designed to attract, retain and reward employees, in order to increase stockholder value and to enable the success of our Company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and share in the value creation process. We also provide access to a variety of flexible health and wellness programs to our employees, which became increasingly critical in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 3,919 full-time employees located in 12 countries. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 35% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. Our geographic diversification enhances our ability to retain and attract highly skilled talent, have an employee base across the globe to be closer to our customers, as well as manage our headcount costs.
In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. For instance, our employees in France are covered by the Syntec Collective Bargaining Agreement. We are not subject to any other collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good, and we have never experienced any work stoppages.
Regulatory
As a provider of communication services over the Internet, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund, and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services. In addition, we have certified a wholly owned subsidiary as a competitive local exchange carrier in thirty-one states, and registered as an IP-enabled Service Provider in an additional eleven states. This subsidiary, RCLEC, is subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commissions in states where the subsidiary provides services. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement for our subsidiary to register or seek certification to provide its services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.
As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our subscriptions. Regulatory treatment of communications services over the Internet outside the U.S. varies from country to country, and may be more onerous than imposed on our subscriptions in the U.S. In the United Kingdom, for example, our subscriptions are regulated by Ofcom, which, among other things, requires electronic communications services providers such as our company to provide all users access to both 112 (EU-mandated) and 999 (U.K.-mandated) emergency service numbers at no charge. Similarly, in Canada, our subscriptions are regulated by the CRTC, which, among other things, imposes requirements like those in the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services, in all areas of Canada where the wireline incumbent carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on the use of our subscriptions in international locations. 
In the course of providing our services, we collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data. Moreover, our customers can use our subscriptions to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store, and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. Customers are able, and may be authorized under certain circumstances, to use our subscriptions to transmit, receive, and/or store personal information.
There are a number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act, which extended the CCPA, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards, that provide for certain obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, and the collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other customer data. We expect that with the expansion of our Global MVP solution and sales of our services into new countries, we will become subject to additional data privacy regulations in other countries throughout the world. The scope of these obligations and restrictions is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules, and their status remains uncertain. 
As Internet commerce and communication technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing online service providers’ and network users’ capacity to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, and transmit large volumes of personal information, increasingly restrictive regulation by federal, state, or foreign agencies becomes more likely.
Regulations that do not directly apply to our business, but which do apply to our customers and partners, can also impact our business. As we expand our business, addressing customer and partner requirements in new jurisdictions and new verticals often requires investment on our part to address regulations that apply to our customers. Globally, these regulations continue to be introduced and to change over time. Such regulations can impact our ability to offer services to various customer segments, and our cost to deliver our services.
