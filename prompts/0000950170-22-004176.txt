 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 Alpha Teknova, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, Teknova, we, us or our) is a leading provider of critical reagents that enable the discovery, development and production of biopharmaceutical products such as drug therapies, novel vaccines, and molecular diagnostics. Our more than 3,000 active customers span the continuum of the life sciences market and include leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, contract development and manufacturing organizations, in vitro diagnostics franchises, and academic and government research institutions. Our Company is built around our knowledge, methods and know-how in our manufacturing processes, which are highly adaptable and configurable. These proprietary processes enable us to manufacture and deliver high quality, custom, made-to-order products with short turnaround times and at scale, across all stages of our customers’ product development, including commercialization.
 We have substantial expertise in manufacturing customer-specified formulations and have demonstrated the ability to manufacture and deliver our products to customers quickly. Due to our expertise in raw materials sourcing, chemical formulation, and quality control, developed over more than two decades, we are typically able to move a new custom product into production in a matter of weeks from order receipt. This can allow our customers to receive their products in weeks as compared to months from alternative suppliers employing traditional production environments. Our processes are designed to handle a diverse array of customer-requested inputs, which vary by volume, chemical formulation, quality specifications, container types, and transportation requirements, enabling broad use of our products across the life sciences market. Our proprietary capabilities and products underpin the value we provide to customers across their product development and commercialization activities and allow us to scale with our clients as they grow, supporting their need for materials in greater volumes and that meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.
We offer three primary product types: pre-poured media plates for cell growth and cloning, liquid cell culture media and supplements for cellular expansion, and molecular biology reagents for sample manipulation, resuspension, and purification. We typically begin working with customers in the discovery phase of development, in which they use off-the-shelf (catalog) formulations for initial experimentation. As customers’ product development progresses and they advance to requiring products with improved performance, in greater volumes, and that meet GMP regulatory requirements, they routinely go on to order high value, custom, and GMP-grade products. We believe the highly bespoke nature of our portfolio makes us a critical, trusted supplier to our customers.
 
Due to the extensive validation required for these custom products, our customers frequently integrate them as components into the lifecycle of their own products and, we believe, are therefore unlikely to substitute Teknova’s components with alternatives. As a result, our customer relationships typically span many years and help drive recurring business. Moreover, we are committed to delivering high levels of customer satisfaction through continued

investment in our customer service, infrastructure, quality systems and manufacturing processes. During 2021, we achieved an annual customer retention rate of approximately 97% for customers purchasing more than $10,000 yearly, which customers accounted for just over 10% of our customer base and approximately 90% of our average annual revenue during that period. We believe the Teknova brand is well established in the life sciences industry as a result of our track record of delivering high quality, custom products and providing superior customer service.
 We participate in multiple market segments because customers use our products across the life sciences, including in high growth areas like cell and gene therapy research, development, and production. The investment capital raised by companies developing and commercializing cell and gene therapies increased from $9.8 billion in 2019 to $19.9 billion in 2020 and then to $23.1 billion in 2021, according to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine.
 Unlike conventional small molecule or protein drugs such as antibodies, many cell and gene therapies require bacterially produced DNA plasmids for their production. Nucleic acid therapeutics, such as the mRNA vaccines developed to reduce the severity of the disease caused by coronavirus infections, are another category of products requiring bacterial production. While sharing some similarities with mammalian bioproduction used for antibodies and other protein therapeutics, bacterial production relies on different processes, reagents, and expertise. Teknova is a leading provider of research and GMP-grade bacterial cell culture media and specialized chromatography solutions, which we believe positions us especially well to capture share in the high growth cell and gene therapy markets.
We believe our prospects for growth will also benefit from developments in other fields, including the validation of mRNA vaccines and their possible use in therapies, continued significant investment in synthetic biology, and growing interest in molecular diagnostics and genomics. We believe the key industry factors that will drive our continued growth include:
 ▪the central role that bacterial cell culture plays in producing plasmids, an essential ingredient in cell and gene therapy bioproduction;
 ▪the need for custom reagents for viral purification in the development of gene therapies to increase viral production efficiency, yield, and purity;
 ▪the growing demand for a single, adaptable, end-to-end provider that can offer both research use only (RUO) as well as GMP-grade, custom, made-to-order products with short turnaround times;
 ▪the importance of GMP-grade products in a development and manufacturing process that is subject to complex and stringent regulatory requirements; and
 ▪the need for suppliers capable of quickly scaling production volumes up and down in response to customer needs.
 The nature of many of our products and their uses require that they be manufactured by highly skilled personnel in contamination-controlled environments, following exacting procedures to ensure quality. We manufacture our products at our facilities in Hollister, California, which were purpose-built to address our customers’ needs for custom-made, RUO, or GMP-grade input components.
 Our Portfolio
 Our products are used across all stages of biopharmaceutical and diagnostic development workflows from discovery to commercialization. They include essential formulations for common research applications and highly customized formulations for customer-specific applications in genomics and bioproduction. Our customers also use our GMP-grade products as components in diagnostic kits and in the production of therapeutics.
Business Lines
 We have two primary business lines: Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions. Previously, we had a third business line, Sample Transport, which we ceased producing in 2021. Our products cross all stages of development, from early research through commercialization.
Lab Essentials
 We are a leader in providing highly complex chemical formulations for use in biological research and drug discovery. Our core research products consist of commonly used, made-to-stock solutions and customer-specified formulations. During discovery, our products are used regularly in small, bench-scale experiments. As customers optimize their processes and begin to scale up in volume, they tend to order more custom products. The Lab Essentials portion of our business includes: pre-poured media plates for cell growth and cloning, liquid cell culture media and supplements for cellular expansion, and molecular biology reagents for sample manipulation, resuspension, and purification. Our research products include essential formulations for common research applications and highly customized formulations for customer-specific applications in genomics and bioproduction. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Lab Essentials business contributed approximately 74% of our total revenue.
Clinical Solutions
 In 2017, we achieved International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485:2016 certification, enabling us to meet the Quality System Regulation (QSR) under 21 CFR Part 820 of products for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Our Clinical Solutions products are custom clinical products used in the production of mRNA vaccines, protein therapies, gene therapies, and diagnostic kits. Since offering GMP-grade products, we have achieved substantial growth in the number of customers seeking these products annually. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Clinical Solutions business contributed approximately 18% of our total revenue.
Sample Transport
 In 2020, we developed and commercialized a suite of sample collection and transport reagents to aid in sample processing for COVID-19 testing. Subsequently, demand for COVID-19 testing declined significantly while the market supply of sample transport medium grew. As a result, in 2021, we decided to cease production of transport medium and no longer market those reagents. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales of Sample Transport products accounted for approximately 4% of our total revenue.
Product Types
 We have three primary product types: pre-poured media plates for cell growth and cloning; liquid cell culture media and supplements for cellular expansion; and molecular biology reagents for sample manipulation, resuspension, and purification.
Pre-poured Media Plates
 We have an extensive selection of standard and specialty pre-poured media plates for a wide variety of applications including bacteria, fungi, and nematode growth. Pre-poured media plates, also referred to as agar plates, are the industry standard for growing microorganisms. The agar contains nutrients for the microorganism to grow and often contains compounds, such as antibiotics, to identify and select for microorganisms of interest. Microbes are spread on agar media to produce colonies, which are identical sets or clones of the original microorganism. The use of media plates is essential in the drug development process as it enables scientists to perform discovery experiments, express proteins, select cells for further expansion, and monitor the sterility of a bioproduction environment. Our ability to manufacture specialty pre-poured media plates across a wide range of formulations and plate formats makes them suitable for the most complex biological experiments and high throughput robotic applications.
Cell Culture Media and Supplements
 Cell culture media and supplements are used to expand, or grow, a particular cell of interest under controlled conditions. Cell culture media is composed of essential nutrients, such as amino acids and carbohydrates, growth factors, and hormones. To maintain the cells in culture, supplements (such as growth factors and sugars) are added to the culture over time. Expansion of cell lines is fundamental to the production of enzymes, antibodies, vaccines, and protein therapeutics. Different cells, based on species of origin or cell type, require different nutrients for efficient growth. The ability to customize cell culture media and supplements for a specific cell line is necessary to optimize bioproduction purity and yield. Given our customers’ desire to optimize cell culture processes early in development, combined with our ability to offer low production volumes for custom formulations, and then to scale production volumes over time, we believe we are a critical supplier for cell culture development and optimization. In addition, we are a leader in the production of bacterial cell culture media and supplements, which are critical inputs into mRNA vaccine and gene therapy production processes.
Molecular Biology Reagents
 Molecular biology reagents are a cornerstone of biological research, molecular diagnostics, drug development, and bioproduction. Molecular biology reagents are used routinely for a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to: washing samples; resuspending samples; purifying nucleic acids or proteins; analyzing samples, cell lysis, and sample management. We offer thousands of stock keeping units (SKUs). Our diverse offering simplifies widely used biological protocols for our customers. As customers begin to scale production volumes and require increased manufacturing precision, customers frequently seek to specify formulations and product packaging requirements—areas we specialize in providing—to achieve their goals of increasing product performance and realizing manufacturing efficiencies.
Competitive Strengths
 Expertise in Complex, Custom Chemical Formulation Manufacturing
 We work closely with our customers to provide highly customized formulations across a variety of workflows. Our customers routinely specify the raw material source, chemical composition, packaging, labeling, and quality control specifications required for their desired product. Through two decades of capital investment and process optimization, we have created a production system designed to develop and manufacture customer-specified formulations, which we believe enables us to produce and quality control custom products faster than our competitors. We leverage our proprietary chemical formulation and production expertise, supported by a product database consisting of the formulations of thousands of previously made products. This database, along with our tenured staff, allows us to quickly determine the optimal production process and meet the associated complexity requirements for custom orders. We believe our ability to rapidly customize has led to significant adoption of our products.
Quality and Regulatory Expertise Drives Deep Customer Relationships
 The life sciences industry is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny in areas such as quality, reliability, and performance. Our customers rely on us to meet these high standards while also facilitating the development of novel, innovative products. During the early stages of product development, we manufacture formulations specified by our customers to aid in the optimization of therapeutic or diagnostic production processes. Our customers frequently validate these custom-made research and GMP-grade components into their production processes, allowing them to remain with us as a single supplier, as they scale up from research to commercial production. As a result of the extensive validation and regulatory requirements applicable to these therapeutic and diagnostic products, we believe these components are often used for the life of a product, as evidenced by our customer retention rates. We are focused on developing and fostering long-term relationships with our customers, which has resulted in increased purchasing volumes from our customers over time.
Industry Leading Delivery Time for Custom Products
 Our operations, built upon our proprietary manufacturing processes developed over the past 20 years, enable adaptable, versatile, and rapid production of complex chemical formulations. Our production process is designed to handle diverse inputs in volume and product type, allowing us to deliver custom, made-to-order products for our clients across the life sciences industry. We seek to collaborate with our customers to gain visibility into their product development and purchasing requirements and are positioned to react quickly to meet their needs. Due to our expertise in raw materials sourcing, product creation, chemical formulation, and quality control, we are typically able to move a new custom product into production in a matter of weeks from order receipt. In addition, we can provide custom solutions at low minimum volumes and increase in scale by 100-fold within the same production environment. This means our customers can receive their products in weeks rather than months compared to other suppliers employing traditional production environments. We ship more than 80% of our custom products less than three weeks from order placement.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, three of our suppliers each made up 10% or more of our total inventory purchases, which suppliers comprised 61% of our total inventory purchases in the aggregate. One supplier, a distributor, accounted for 40% of total inventory purchases and two of our other suppliers accounted for 11% and 10% of total inventory purchases, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, four of our suppliers each made up 10% or more of our total inventory purchases, which suppliers comprised 86% of our total inventory purchases in the aggregate. One supplier, a distributor, accounted for 29% of our total inventory purchases and three of our other suppliers accounted for 25%, 21% and 11% of total inventory purchases, respectively.
Well Positioned in Rapidly Evolving Cell and Gene Therapy Market
 We work closely with our cell and gene therapy customers to provide customized, made-to-order formulations across a variety of workflows. Our products are critical components frequently used in the research and development of cell-and-gene-therapy-derived pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In particular, we are a leading provider of research and GMP-grade bacterial cell culture media and specialized chromatography solutions—reagents required for plasmid and therapeutic nucleic acid production—which we believe positions us especially well to capture share in these growing markets.
 A report commissioned by us predicts that, compared to spending during phase 1 clinical trials, average spend by customers developing cell and gene therapies increases by 1.4 times during phase 2 trials, 3.2 times during phase 3 trials and 29.8 times during commercial production, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Our data shows that in calendar year 2021, of our approximately 80 customers who were active in cell and gene therapy development, 42% of them purchased solely catalog products from us, 40% purchased at least one custom product, and 18% purchased at least one GMP-grade product. We therefore believe that our customers will spend more with us over time as cell and gene therapies move through the FDA approval process and they purchase more GMP-grade products. Combined with our existing strengths and planned investments in areas valued by developers of cell and gene therapies, which we discuss elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we therefore aim to significantly increase our overall revenue from sales to customers active in cell and gene therapy in the years ahead.

 Experienced Leadership and Talented Workforce
 Our senior management team has deep experience across the life sciences, diagnostics, and biopharmaceutical market segments. Our senior management team has served in numerous leadership roles at both large, multinational organizations and small growth companies. Our employees, a number of whom have been with us for over a decade, provide tailored support, guidance, and service for our customers. We believe the quality of our personnel is critical to our ability to maintain collaborative, long-standing relationships with our customers.
Our Markets
 We participate in multiple market segments, because customers use our products across the life sciences, including in high growth areas like cell and gene therapy research, development, and production. We believe our prospects for growth will also benefit from developments in other fields, including the validation of mRNA vaccines and their possible use in therapies, continued significant investment in synthetic biology, and growing interest in molecular diagnostics and genomics. Within these market segments, we have benefited from and expect to continue to benefit from favorable industry preferences for customized products, high quality, and short turnaround times. The key factors driving the growth in our market opportunity include the rapid expansion of cell and gene therapy, an increase in the use of mRNA vaccines and therapies, and the growing acceptance of molecular diagnostics and genomics.
 The following are some of the other factors benefiting our core markets:
 ▪Favorable Research and Development Funding. Investment in R&D activities in the life sciences sector is rapidly increasing. Further, we expect pharmaceutical companies to continue to outsource R&D activities as they focus on process efficiency. As a supplier of critical reagents that enable the discovery, research, development and production of biopharmaceutical products such as drug therapies, novel vaccines, and molecular diagnostics, we expect to benefit from these favorable R&D dynamics.
 ▪Development of New Therapeutic Modalities. Increased innovation and R&D activity in our addressable markets is driving the development of a plethora of new therapeutic modalities. Further, we expect much of the R&D activity geared toward COVID-19 to shift more broadly over time to other vaccines and therapeutic areas.
 ▪Favorable Demographic Trends. We believe the global demand for healthcare is significantly increasing due to factors such as aging populations, better access to healthcare systems and care, and an increased occurrence of chronic illness.
 ▪Global Expansion Opportunities. We expect favorable R&D funding, the development of new therapeutic modalities, and favorable demographic trends to apply globally. We believe this presents attractive expansion opportunities in the global market. 
 In addition to our core markets, we believe there are additional factors driving our key growth markets, including:
 Rapid Growth in Cell and Gene Therapy
 As a supplier to approximately 80 leading cell and gene therapy organizations, we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in this market through our high quality, custom, and made-to-order products. The investment capital raised by companies developing and commercializing cell and gene therapies increased from $9.8 billion in 2019 to $19.9 billion in 2020 and then to $23.1 billion in 2021, according to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. Factors driving this growth include an increasing incidence of cancer and other chronic diseases, a rising number of clinical trials, a favorable regulatory environment, and FDA approvals for cell and gene therapy products.
 We support the development of these therapies by providing customer-specified chemical formulations for bioprocessing, scale-up, and commercialization. Bacterial cell culture and supplements are used early in the product development cycle. We believe our product portfolio and our expertise in custom formulations allows us to work closely with our customers at the early stages of product development to optimize manufacturing processes for their particular therapies, and then to scale as their production needs evolve. Therefore, we are able to play an integral role in therapeutic development and, ultimately, commercialization. We believe that because our products are often customized for a specific therapy and validated, it is unlikely these customers would switch suppliers once their therapies enter clinical trials.


Increasing Use of mRNA Vaccines and Therapies
 As a leader in bacterial cell culture media and supplements, lysis buffers, and nucleic acid and protein purification reagents, we are a supplier to the mRNA vaccine and therapeutics market and are well positioned to benefit from the increasing use of mRNA vaccines and therapies. We believe the demand for mRNA will continue to increase and therefore drive the need for more customized, research and GMP-grade bacterial cell culture media and associated formulations. The short development timeline and proven effectiveness of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have demonstrated the promise of mRNA therapies. The production process for mRNA requires the use of bacteria for plasmid production and a substantial number of chemical formulations for producing, purifying, and re-suspending nucleic acid sequences.
 Increase in Molecular Diagnostics and Genomics
 According to third-party research, the global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to grow from $14.1 billion in 2020 to $18.0 billion by 2024, while the global genomics market is expected to grow from $23.5 billion in 2021 to $62.9 billion by 2028. We expect this growth to continue to drive demand for our research and clinical grade reagents as high growth diagnostics and genomic market leaders use our formulations as critical components in their manufacturing processes and saleable kits. For example, synthetic biology, enzyme, and antibody manufacturers often use our bacterial cell culture media and related cell lysis and purification buffers to produce their cell lines or proteins of interest. A number of our customers in the life science tools and molecular diagnostic market segments, such as spatial transcriptomics, single cell sequencing, and liquid biopsy, use our molecular biology reagents as critical subcomponents in the kits they sell to their end users.
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to provide our customers the products necessary to accelerate their therapeutic and diagnostic development efforts, from basic research to commercialization of drugs that improve human health. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal include:
Increase Integration of Our Products into Our Customers’ Workflows
 Building long-term partnerships and embedding our products within our customers’ key workflows are at the core of our strategy. During the early stages of product development, we manufacture formulations specified by our customers to aid in the optimization of therapeutic or diagnostic production processes. Our customers validate these custom-made research and GMP-grade components into their production processes, and because of the extensive validation required for the customers' therapeutic and diagnostic products, we believe these components are often used for the life of a product, as evidenced by our customer retention rates. As customers move from catalog to custom and, ultimately, to clinical production, their total expenditure increases. Based on our purchase data from 2021, excluding purchase data relating to sample transport medium, customers who purchased our custom products spent approximately 12 times more on average per account with us than those who solely purchased catalog products. Over the same period, our customers who purchased our GMP-grade products, purchased 98 times more per account with us than those who solely purchased catalog products and approximately 8 times more than those who purchased catalog and custom research-grade products. In 2021, customers who purchased solely catalog products, custom products, and GMP-grade products constituted approximately 87%, 12% and 1%, respectively, of Company’s total customers during the period. We aim to increase the proportion of our customers purchasing custom products and GMP-grade products by building long-term partnerships and embedding our products within our customers’ key workflows as our customers’ product development matures.
Provide Superior Customer Service Through Operational Excellence
 We are committed to providing superior customer service and fulfilling the expectations of our customers by making the investments required to perpetuate our operational excellence. We intend to extend our rapid custom production capability by further investing in automation, facilities, and infrastructure to substantially increase the manufacturing capacity at our facilities, improve operating efficiency, and reduce delivery time for our custom research and GMP-grade products. We have recently expanded our footprint from 137,000 square feet to approximately 257,400 square feet and expect to expand our total production capacity by five-fold over the course

of the next two years. We believe these investments will allow us to continue to exceed our customers’ expectations in quality and delivery time and enable us to maintain lasting relationships with our customers as they advance their products through key phases of product development.
 Expand R&D and Commercial Scale to Establish Leadership in High Growth Market Segments
 Over the past two decades, we focused almost entirely on developing and enhancing the operational and service aspects of our business, with limited investment in our commercial organization and R&D. Beginning in 2021, we implemented a long-term plan of substantial investment in our marketing, sales, R&D, and technical support capabilities as well as the expansion and automation of manufacturing operations. We believe these investments will enable us to increase our brand awareness, develop new products and services, and attract new customers.
 Our initial focus is on the high growth gene therapy and nucleic acid therapeutic market segments, building upon our current cell and gene therapy customer base. These segments require short turnaround times for custom-made formulations that scale to production for clinical use. In addition, we intend to build viral and nucleic acid bioproduction expertise within the Company, and a scientific field presence to provide new services and support models for our target customers. We are focused on bringing differentiated technologies to market that enable improved processes and efficiencies in gene therapy and nucleic acid bioproduction. Through these efforts, we aim to onboard new gene therapy and mRNA therapeutic customers and to support existing customers when they migrate from research to GMP-grade products.
 Selectively Expand in Geographies with Attractive Growth Potential
 In 2021, we generated more than 97% of our total revenue within the U.S. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to expand our geographic reach into markets outside of the U.S. that offer strong opportunities for growth, including Europe. Based on our knowledge of the industry, we believe the local supply base in Europe is not able to produce customer-specified formulations with the diversity and at the scale necessary to satisfy the corresponding demand, with the short turnaround times customers expect. Therefore, in the near and medium terms, we intend to expand our addressable market and customer base by pursuing opportunities to grow either by developing new relationships with entities that can help us establish manufacturing capabilities or by acquiring existing operating businesses in Europe. We may also explore acquisition opportunities in our existing and adjacent market segments within the U.S. to add capabilities and to accelerate our entry into new markets and locations domestically.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment with a diverse base of competitors, many of whom focus on specific regions, customers, and/or segments. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases are also large customers, have greater financial and human resources, R&D, manufacturing, and marketing experience than we do. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to or compete with our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing, and commercialization activities. We also compete with other smaller, niche competitors and specialized companies that focus on certain areas. A portion of our target customers have pre-established, in-house production capabilities to manufacture products that are substantially similar to our products. In-house production may prove to be a less costly or more desirable alternative to purchasing our products due to prior investments in production infrastructure and workforce.
Our Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions products compete on the basis of delivery time, performance, and quality with products offered by numerous large, established life science companies such as Thermo Fisher, Millipore (Merck KGaA), Cytiva (Danaher), Hardy Diagnostics, and Lonza. We are differentiated by our ability to offer customer-specified RUO and GMP formulations with short turnaround times in quantities matching customer needs, our Teknova brand reputation established over more than 20 years, and our scientific and technical expertise.
Government Regulation
 We manufacture products used for the development and commercialization of drug therapies, vaccines, and molecular diagnostics. The quality of our products is critical to researchers and biopharmaceutical companies looking to develop novel vaccines and therapies, or who are engaged in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and for biopharmaceutical customers who use our products as input components or as part of their final devices or products.
 Biopharmaceutical and life sciences customers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and by equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, regarding the conduct of clinical trials and the commercialization of products for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The regulatory oversight of our customers necessitates that they impose rigorous quality requirements on us, as their supplier, through supplier qualification processes and customer contracts, including routine customer audits. We must maintain a compliant quality system, including records of our manufacturing, testing, and control activities, and must be able to provide our customers with corresponding records on a periodic basis, upon their request. In addition, if any of our products were classified as “medical devices,” we would need to register them with the FDA before they could be manufactured. Although we do not believe that any of our current products qualify as medical devices, we have voluntarily registered certain of them with the FDA; during such time as these products remain registered, we will comply with regulations applicable thereto. None of our other products are regulated by the FDA.
Our facilities are subject to licensing and regulation, as appropriate, under federal, state and local laws relating to:
 ▪quality systems;
 ▪the surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents, and hazardous materials;
 ▪the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including toxic substances), biological reagents, and hazardous waste;
 ▪the procurement, handling, use, storage, and disposal of biological products for research purposes;
 ▪the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and
 ▪protection of the environment and general public.
 A dedicated group manages our quality and safety programs, including through the use of qualified outside consultants.
 We have established a quality management system to ensure that management has proper oversight of compliance and quality assurance. We perform periodic management reviews of our quality system to ensure that appropriate quality measures and controls are in place.
 Research Products
 We believe that our products that are marketed as RUO products are exempt from compliance with GMP regulations under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, we do not make any claims related to the safety, effectiveness, or diagnostic utility of our RUO products, and they are not intended for clinical, therapeutic, or diagnostic use.
 In November 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (the RUO/IUO Guidance). The FDA guidance document provides the FDA’s current thinking on when in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products are properly labeled for RUO or for investigational use only (IUO). FDA guidance is issued by the FDA staff and does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities and should be viewed as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the product from FDA regulation or oversight, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical,

therapeutic, or diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. We believe that our products that are labeled “For Research Use Only” meet the intent of the RUO/IUO Guidance. We do not market such products for use in clinical, therapeutic, or diagnostic settings. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical products that would require clearance or approval prior to commercialization.
 We do not make claims related to the safety or effectiveness of our RUO products, and they are not intended for diagnostic or clinical use. However, the quality of our products is critical to meeting customer needs and we therefore voluntarily follow the quality standards outlined by the International Organization for Standardization. We have received certification to manufacture our products for clinical use under ISO 13485:2016.
 Some biopharmaceutical customers desire custom products. Our customers may further process and validate these products for their applications. Customers qualify us as part of their quality system requirements, which can include a supplier questionnaire and on-site audits. Customers requalify us on a regular basis to ensure our quality system, processes, and facilities continue to meet their needs and requirements outlined in relevant customer agreements.
 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
 Laboratories that purchase certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), which applies to all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the U.S. (with the exception of clinical trials and basic research). A clinical laboratory is defined by CLIA as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens obtained from humans for the purpose of providing information for health assessment or for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA requires laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance, and inspections. Certification through the CLIA program is generally a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. As a condition of CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS-approved accreditation organization. High complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories frequently develop proprietary testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. In the conduct of our business, we handle, store and dispose of certain chemicals and biohazardous waste. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Some of these environmental laws and regulations impose “strict liability,” rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination, including remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, us or others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigation, remediation and monitoring requirements under federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
 We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition

of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted, we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future, or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and trade secrets, to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, and to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights.
 We rely on trade secrets, including know-how, confidential information, unpatented technologies and other proprietary information, to strengthen or enhance our competitive position, and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. We maintain, as trade secrets, information relating to our current products and our products currently in development, as well as information related to our business strategy, client lists and business methods. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. To avoid inadvertent and improper disclosure of trade secrets, and to avoid the risks of former employees using these trade secrets to gain future employment, it is our policy to require employees, consultants and independent contractors to assign to us all rights to intellectual property they develop in connection with their employment with or services for us. We also protect our existing and developing intellectual property expressly through confidentiality provisions in agreements with third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information, or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives, which may include objectives within and outside of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, these rights may not be respected in the future or may be circumvented or challenged (and potentially invalidated) in a legal proceeding in any jurisdiction where we have intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries may not afford the same protections or assurances to the same extent as the laws in the U.S. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to intellectual property.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 237 employees, of which 231 were full-time and six were part-time. This includes 128 employees in our operations organization, 59 in administrative functions, 30 in sales and marketing and 20 in engineering and research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 Facilities
 Our headquarters are located in Hollister, California, where we lease approximately 233,200 square feet of commercial, office, manufacturing, and warehouse space at seven separate locations in the same vicinity, which we refer to collectively as our Hollister campus. Our Hollister campus includes dedicated space for us to carry out product formulation, dispensing, manufacturing and packaging of our products. The Hollister campus includes space

used for quality control, packaging, and storage of “retains” for quality control purposes and 2,500 square feet of clean room space. Offices used to store our finished goods inventory, ship our products, and house our engineering and quality departments are also located at our Hollister campus along with a receiving warehouse and raw materials storage. Our management offices, R&D/product development team, lab, customer service and marketing groups are also located at the Hollister campus. We are expanding our Hollister campus to include additional manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, clean room and office space.
 We also lease approximately 23,400 square feet of warehouse space in Mansfield, Massachusetts under a lease that expires by its terms in August 2024. We lease the warehouse space in Mansfield from Meeches LLC, a company controlled by Ted Davis and Irene Davis, our founders and current directors and greater than five percent stockholders of ours.
We believe that the facilities we currently lease are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, additional space can be acquired or leased to accommodate future growth.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Summary of Risk Factors
Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below beginning at “Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy” within this Item 1A., "Risk Factors" and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission before making investment decisions regarding our common stock.
 ▪We have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur losses in the future.
 ▪Our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, making them difficult to predict, and they could fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide. 


▪Our efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these initiatives in the time frame anticipated or at all.
 ▪We depend on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue. If we cannot maintain our current relationships with customers, fail to sustain recurring sources of revenue with our existing customers, or if we fail to enter into new relationships, our future operating results will be adversely affected.
 ▪We compete with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, some of whom are our customers, who are substantially larger than we are and potentially capable of developing new approaches that could make our products and technology obsolete or develop their own internal capabilities that compete with our products.
 ▪It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges.
 ▪Future strategic investments or transactions may require us to seek additional financing, which we may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all.
 ▪Future acquisitions may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies. 
 ▪Until very recently, we have not invested in marketing and selling our products. If we are unable to build a successful commercial (product development, marketing, and sales) function, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.
 ▪Our long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and introduce and market new products and services successfully.
 ▪The market may not be receptive to our new products and services upon their introduction.
 ▪Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
 ▪We and our customers’ respective business operations are and will continue to be subject to extensive government laws and regulations, and assessing the applicability and relevant requirements of, and maintaining compliance with, these laws and regulations can be expensive and time consuming.
 ▪We rely on assumptions, estimates and data to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
 ▪We rely primarily on trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our technologies. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our technology, the value of our technology and products could be materially adversely affected. 
 ▪The terms of that certain credit and security agreement (Term Loan), dated as of March 26, 2021, by and among the Company and MidCap Financial Trust, as agent and lender, and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto, and that certain credit and security agreement (Revolving Loan), dated as of March 26, 2021, by and among the Company and MidCap Financial Trust, as agent and lender, and the additional lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Credit Agreement) may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.
 ▪Telegraph Hill Partners Management Company LLC, through its affiliates THP LP and THP LLC, controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
 ▪Shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, and we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules and listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ). As 


a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections as those afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.
 ▪Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may cause us to fail to timely and accurately report our financial results or result in a material misstatement of our financial statements.
 ▪The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”.
 ▪Provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.
 Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy
We have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur losses in the future.
We have incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. For the period ending December 31, 2021, we incurred net losses of $9.8 million and although we had net income of approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, we also incurred net losses prior to such time, including $1.3 million for the period from January 14, 2019 through December 31, 2019, and approximately $0.1 million for the period from January 1, 2019 through January 13, 2019. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business and we anticipate additional costs in connection with legal, accounting and other administrative expenses related to operating as a public company. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from our products and the sale of our equity securities, including through our IPO. While our revenue has grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate sufficient to offset increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. We may never be able to generate sufficient revenue to maintain profitability, and our recent growth and historical profitability should not be considered indicative of our future performance.
 Our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, making them difficult to predict, and they could fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.
Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, making them difficult to predict. These fluctuations may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. They may occur due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 ▪demand from our largest customers, which account for a significant percentage of our sales and orders, may not meet our expectations regarding volume and price in any given time period; 
 ▪the level of demand for our products, which may vary significantly, and our ability to increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into new markets; 
 ▪customers accelerating, canceling, reducing or delaying orders, including as a result of developments related to their pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, or plans for commercialization; 
 ▪impacts on us, our suppliers and our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or responses to it; 
 ▪the relative quality, performance, and reliability of our products; 
 ▪changes in governmental regulations or the regulatory posture toward our business and the businesses of our customers; 
 ▪the volume and mix of the products and services we sell or changes in the production or sales costs related to our offerings; 
 ▪the success of new products we introduce or product enhancements we or others in our industry make; 


▪the timing and amount of expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional products, services and technologies or for other purposes, including the expansion of our facilities; 
 ▪changes in governmental and academic funding of or capital market investment in life sciences research and development or changes that impact budgets, budget cycles or seasonal spending patterns of our customers; 
 ▪future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;
 ▪difficulties encountered by our commercial carriers in delivering our products, whether as a result of external factors such as weather or internal issues such as labor disputes; 
 ▪general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and 
 ▪the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.
 The impact of any one of the factors set out above, or the cumulative effects of a combination of such factors, could result in significant fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Furthermore, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results expected for any future period, and quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other period, and accordingly should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.
As a result of variability and unpredictability, we may also fail to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall short of the expectations of analysts or investors or any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide falls short of the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met or exceeded any publicly stated guidance we may have provided and could in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Our efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these initiatives in the time frame anticipated or at all.
We continue to extend our production capabilities by investing in automation and infrastructure to substantially increase the manufacturing capacity at our facilities, improve operating efficiency through the use of automation, and reduce delivery time for our custom RUO products and our products manufactured subject to GMP requirements. We have recently expanded our footprint from 137,000 square feet to approximately 257,400 square feet and expect to expand our total production capacity by five-fold over the course of the next two years. The expansion and automation of our existing manufacturing facilities, as well as the creation of new or expanded manufacturing operations, could be disruptive to our operations, divert the attention of management and require significant investments. Our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity is dependent upon a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, the procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, delays in construction, potential supply chain constraints, hiring, the training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high quality products at scale. If we experience any problems or delays in meeting our projected timelines for expansion, if our projected costs or capital efficiency expectations are not met, or if the anticipated production capacity for our expansion efforts is not as expected, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be harmed.
Our efforts to increase the scale and capacity of our manufacturing processes and systems may result in temporary constraints on our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling, manufacturing and other related processes are complex, and could impact or delay production. A prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our

products and increase the size of our product inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our performance. Furthermore, delays in production could harm our reputation of being a supplier that is able to deliver customer-specified formulations on a short turnaround time, which may harm our brand, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
We may be unable to successfully expand our operations or manage our growth effectively.
The expansion of our manufacturing operations, new product development, the development of our marketing and sales organizations, and our organic growth have all accelerated and will continue to increase the complexity of our business. Acquisitions we may pursue in the future, including of businesses located outside the U.S, would contribute to that increased complexity. Expansion of our operations may place significant demands on our management, finances and other resources. Our ability to manage our ongoing and anticipated future growth, should it continue, depends upon a significant expansion of our enterprise, financial and other internal management systems and the implementation and subsequent improvement of a variety of systems, procedures and controls. There can be no assurance that significant problems in these areas will not occur. Any failure to develop these areas and implement and improve supporting systems, procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with the growth of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
If our products do not possess the required or expected quality characteristics or perform as expected, or if the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, we could experience lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.
Our success depends in large measure on the market’s confidence that we can provide reliable, high quality reagents for the development and commercialization of drug therapies, novel vaccines and molecular diagnostics, including products manufactured subject to GMP requirements. We believe that customers in our target markets are particularly sensitive to product nonconformances, defects, and errors given the potential for impact on their own products and processes, which in many cases are regulated. Our reputation and the public image of our products and technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected.
Although our products undergo quality control testing prior to release for shipment, nonconformances, defects or errors could nonetheless occur or be present in products that we release for shipment to customers. Our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management, and our ability to consistently meet GMP regulatory requirements, where applicable, and meet the product specification and quality requirements under agreements with customers. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations, the preparation or provision of products or our ability to meet GMP regulatory requirements. These and related problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunctions, the failure to follow specific manufacturing and quality control and assurance protocols and procedures or other human error, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, our quality systems. The consequences could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of those products or a halt of facility production altogether. Furthermore, some of the products we manufacture are subsequently incorporated into products that are sold by other life sciences companies; we have no control over the manufacture and production of those products.
In addition, if we or our suppliers fail to meet applicable quality standards and if our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material nonconformance, defect, or error, our products could be recalled or we may be unable to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Although we continually take steps to improve our quality procedures, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience quality assurance issues with our products in the future. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, delayed or lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance, damage to our reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, reimbursement to customers, other customer claims, damage to and possible termination of existing customer relationships, increased insurance costs, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Such

nonconformances, defects or errors could also narrow the scope of the use of our products, which could hinder our success in the market.
Even after any underlying quality or related concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target markets regarding our products or services, or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our products, could continue to result in lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance, damage to our reputation and claims against us.
In addition, we may be unable to maintain the quality, reliability, robustness and expected turnaround times of our products and services to continue to satisfy customer demand as we grow. Fast delivery time is of crucial importance to the cell and gene therapy market segment and our customers rely on us to provide swift delivery of their custom-made formulations. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, quality control and assurance and monitoring systems and processes and other aspects of our business and continue to effectively expand, train and manage our personnel. The time and resources required to improve our existing systems and procedures, to implement new systems and procedures and to adequately staff such existing and new systems and procedures is uncertain, and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations and negatively impact our business and financial results. We may need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up and validate, establish new production processes and increase our personnel levels to meet increased demand. We are also in the process of expanding our manufacturing capabilities over the course of the next two years. There can be no assurance that any of these anticipated increases in scale, personnel growth, equipment or process enhancements or manufacturing expansion will be successfully implemented. Failure to manage this growth could result in delays in turnaround times, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products and could damage our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.
 If the quality or delivery of our products does not meet regulatory requirements or our customers’ expectations, our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted.
 In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, including defects in our engineering, design, manufacturing and delivery processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because our consumables are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services. Although we have established internal procedures to reduce the risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. We have not to date been the subject of inspections by the FDA, and cannot predict or guarantee what the results would be if we were to be so inspected. In addition, identifying the root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting reagents and third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls or other service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global epidemics, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic.
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how the pandemic will impact customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may materially and adversely affect our business operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that are difficult to predict, including: the severity of the virus

and any related variants; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions in response to the pandemic (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide products or services); the impact of the pandemic on our supply chain; and on economic activity; the extent and duration of the effect on customer demand and buying patterns; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs through the operations and other critical functions, particularly if employees are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to employees and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms (if at all) and continue to meet our liquidity needs. All of the foregoing factors and developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, we cannot predict the continued impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
 Changes in economic conditions could negatively impact our revenue and earnings.
Our chemical formulations are sold primarily to biopharmaceutical companies, life science research companies, contract research organizations (CROs), contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), in vitro diagnostics franchises, and academic and government research institutions developing novel vaccines and therapies and performing basic research. Research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. Changes in government funding for certain research or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us or our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. A substantial majority of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay their product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and often without penalty to them. Changes in the level of orders received and filled can cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and earnings.
We are dependent on our customers’ spending on and demand for our products. A reduction in spending or demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 The success of our business depends primarily on the number and size of purchase orders from our customers, primarily biopharmaceutical companies, life science research companies, CROs, CDMOs, in vitro diagnostics franchises, and academic and government research institutions, for our products. Over the past several years, we have benefited from an increased demand for our products as a result of the continued growth of the global biologics and diagnostics market segments, increasing research and development budgets of our customers and greater degree of outsourcing by our customers. A slowing or reversal of any of these trends could have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products.
 In addition to these industry trends, our customers’ willingness and ability to utilize our products are also subject to, among other things, their own financial performance, changes in their available resources, their decisions to acquire in-house manufacturing capacity, their spending priorities, their budgetary policies and practices and their need to develop new biological products, which, in turn, are dependent upon a number of factors, including their competitors’ discoveries, developments and commercial manufacturing initiatives and the anticipated market, clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. In addition, consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on our customers’ spending as they integrate acquired operations, including research and development departments and associated budgets. If our customers reduce their spending on our products as a result of any of these or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.


We depend on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue. If we cannot maintain our current relationships with customers, fail to sustain recurring sources of revenue with our existing customers, or if we fail to enter into new relationships, our future operating results will be adversely affected.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our largest customer was a distributor that accounted for 18% and 15% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had one additional direct customer that accounted for 10% of our total revenue. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our customers that are distributors, as opposed to direct customers, represent highly diversified customer bases. All customers buy from us on a purchase order basis. The revenue attributable to our top customers has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, the termination of these relationships could result in a temporary or permanent loss of revenue.
 Our future success depends on our ability to maintain these relationships, to increase our penetration among these existing customers and to establish new relationships. We engage in conversations with other companies and institutions regarding potential commercial opportunities on an ongoing basis, which can be time consuming. There is no assurance that any of these conversations will result in a commercial agreement, or if an agreement is reached, that the resulting relationship will be successful. Speculation in the industry about our existing or potential commercial relationships can be a catalyst for adverse speculation about us, our products and our technology, which can adversely affect our reputation and our business. In addition, if our customers order our products but fail to pay on time or at all, our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
 We compete with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, some of whom are our customers, who are substantially larger than we are and potentially capable of developing new approaches that could make our products and technology obsolete or develop their own internal capabilities that compete with our products.
 The market for biologics components products and services in the biopharmaceutical development, life science research, and diagnostics space is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving, significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities by industry participants and subject to rapid technological change. We also expect increased competition as additional companies enter our market and as more advanced technologies become available. We compete with other providers of outsourced biologics components products and services. We also compete with the in-house discovery, development and commercial manufacturing functions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors, which in some cases are also our customers, are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater resources and market share than we have. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to or compete with our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on product and service development, marketing, sales and other initiatives than we can. Many of these competitors also have:
 ▪broader name recognition;
 ▪longer operating histories and the benefits derived from greater economies of scale;
 ▪larger and more established distribution networks;
 ▪additional product and service lines and the ability to bundle products and services to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
 ▪more experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing and marketing;
 ▪more experience in entering into collaborations or other strategic partnership arrangements; and
 ▪more financial, manufacturing and human resources to support product development, sales and marketing and patent and other intellectual property litigation.
 These factors, among others, may enable our competitors to market their products and services at lower prices or on terms more advantageous to customers than we can offer. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced

gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Additionally, our current and future competitors, including certain of our customers, may at any time develop additional products and services that compete with our products and new approaches by these competitors may make our products, technologies and methodologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.
 In addition, to develop and market our new products, services, technologies and methodologies successfully, we must accurately assess and meet customers’ needs, make significant capital expenditures, optimize our development and manufacturing processes to predict and control costs, hire, train and retain the necessary personnel, increase customer awareness and acceptance of such services, provide high quality services in a timely manner, price our products and services competitively and effectively integrate customer feedback into our business planning. If we fail to create demand for our new products, services or technologies, our future business could be harmed.
 It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges.
 We face significant competition across many of our product lines. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on us. Moreover, customers may believe that larger companies are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact our future revenue and profitability.
 Certain of our products are used by customers in the development and production of novel vaccines, drug therapies and molecular diagnostics, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment and testing. Unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these treatments and their financial cost may damage public perception of the safety, utility, or efficacy of these vaccines and therapies or other modes of treatment and may harm our customers’ ability to conduct their business. Such events may negatively impact our revenue and have an adverse effect on our performance.
 Gene therapy and mRNA vaccines remain relatively new and are under active development, with only a few gene therapies and mRNA vaccines authorized or approved to date by regulatory authorities. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy or mRNA vaccines are unsafe or ineffective, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In addition, ethical, social, legal and financial concerns about gene therapy and mRNA vaccines could result in additional regulations or limitations or even prohibitions on certain gene therapies or vaccine-related products. More restrictive regulations or negative public perception could reduce certain of our customers’ use of our products, which could negatively affect our revenue and performance. In addition, certain vaccine development and diagnostic testing programs utilize our bacterial cell culture media and our molecular biology reagents, which we manufacture subject to GMP requirements. While some are still in early stages of development, others have been through clinical trials and have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. There can be no assurance that products receiving EUA will receive full FDA approval or that there will not be changes in formulation affecting the use of our products. There can be no assurance that any gene therapy, vaccine programs or diagnostic tests will proceed to clinical trials or result in a commercial product, or that any resulting gene therapies, vaccines or diagnostic tests will incorporate or utilize our products.
 Our products are highly complex and are subject to manufacturing and quality control and assurance regulatory compliance requirements.
 We apply quality control procedures, including inspection of the product or materials, the verification of stability and/or performance and, for certain products, additional validation requirements, whether a product we offer is designed and manufactured by us, or purchased from outside suppliers. All of our quality control processes are administered under a system designed to adhere to the QSR under 21 CFR Part 820, and ISO 13485:2016. Certain of our products, such as RUO products, and some other products offered for limited uses or that are the subject of certain exemptions, are manufactured following QSR that, while not required by existing regulatory requirements, are in place to assure product quality throughout the process, from receiving through final packaging. We believe these products are exempt from compliance with the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and

the current GMP (cGMP) regulations of the FDA, as they are further processed by our customers and we do not make claims related to their safety or effectiveness. In the event we or our suppliers manufacture products that fail to comply with required quality standards, we may incur delays in fulfilling orders, recalls, damages resulting from product liability claims and/or harm to our reputation.
 If our customers do not qualify our manufacturing lines or if we are unable to maintain our ISO certification, our operating results could suffer.
 Our manufacturing lines have passed our qualification standards, as well as our technical standards. However, our customers may also require that our manufacturing lines pass their specific qualification standards and that we be registered under international quality standards. In addition, our customers may require that we maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification. Problems in the design or quality of our products may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and could result in us losing our ISO certification. In the event we are unable to maintain process controls required to maintain ISO certification, or in the event we fail to pass an ISO certification audit for any reason, we could lose our ISO certification. We may also encounter quality issues in the future as a result of the expansion and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing facilities or ramping new products to full volume production. We may be unable to obtain customer qualification of our manufacturing lines or we may experience delays in obtaining customer qualification of our manufacturing lines. Such delays or failure to obtain or maintain qualifications may delay the manufacturing of our products or require us to divert resources away from other areas of our business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
 If we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects would suffer.
 The introduction of our products into our customers’ existing laboratory workflows and ongoing customer support for our products can be complex. Accordingly, we need highly trained technical support personnel. Hiring technical support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our products and their uses at a technical level. To effectively support potential new customers and the expanding needs of current customers, we will need to substantially expand our technical support staff. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business needs, our business and prospects will suffer.
 We depend on a stable and adequate supply of quality raw materials from our suppliers, and price increases or interruptions of such supply could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Our operations depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, whether due to inflation in the broader economy or to developments more particular to our supply chain, we may not be able to produce certain of our products at marketable prices or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Certain of our raw materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, purchases from suppliers making up 10% or more of our total inventory purchases represented 61% and 86% of total inventory purchases, respectively. However, we note that one of these suppliers is a distributor that sells products on behalf of a diversified supply chain. Delays or difficulties in securing these raw materials or other laboratory materials could result in an interruption in our production operations if we cannot obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Although we believe that we have stable relationships with our existing suppliers, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure a stable supply of raw materials going forward. Our suppliers may not be able to keep up with our pace of growth or may reduce or cease their supply of raw materials to us at any time. While we may identify other suppliers, raw materials furnished by such replacement suppliers may require us to alter our production operations or perform extensive validations, which may be time consuming and expensive. In addition, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have obtained and will be able to obtain or maintain all licenses, permits and approvals necessary for their operations or comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and the failure to do so

by them may lead to interruption in their business operations, which in turn may result in shortages of raw materials supplied to us. Some of our suppliers are based overseas and therefore may need to maintain export or import licenses. If the supply of raw materials is interrupted, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.
 If we are unable to manufacture in specific quantities, our operating results will be harmed.
 Our revenue and other operating results depend in large part on our ability to manufacture and ship our products in sufficient quantities and on specific timelines. Any interruptions we experience in the manufacturing or shipping of our products could delay our ability to recognize revenue in a particular quarter. Manufacturing problems can and do arise, and as demand for our products increases, any such problems could have an increasingly significant impact on our operating results. While we have not experienced significant problems with, or delays in our production capabilities that resulted in delays in our ability to ship finished products, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the future. COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. While not significant, we have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We may not be able to quickly ship products and recognize anticipated revenue for a given period if we experience significant delays in the manufacturing process. In addition, we must maintain sufficient production capacity in order to meet anticipated customer demand, and we may be unable to offset the associated fixed costs if orders slow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. Furthermore, our customers rely on us for fast delivery of their custom-made formulations, and if our production timeline slows down, we may not be able to meet their expectations and our relationships could suffer. If we are unable to manufacture our products consistently, in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects will be materially and adversely affected.
 Future strategic investments or transactions may require us to seek additional financing, which we may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all.
We plan to continue a strategy of growth and development for our business. To this end, we actively evaluate various strategic investments and transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of products and services. We may need to seek additional financing to fund these strategic investments or transactions. Should we need to do so, we may not be able to secure such financing, or obtain such financing on favorable terms. In addition, future acquisitions may require the issuance or sale of additional equity, or equity-linked securities, which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The Credit Agreement imposes significant restrictions on our ability to make acquisitions or certain other investments and our ability to make such acquisitions or other investments may be further limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities we may issue or any future credit facilities we may enter into.
Natural disasters, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic events could disrupt the supply, delivery or demand of our products, which could negatively affect our operations and performance.
We are subject to the risk of damage, destruction and business disruption caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters; fire; power shortages; geopolitical unrest, war, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts; public health issues, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and other events beyond our control and the control of the third parties on which we depend. Any of these catastrophic events, whether in the U.S. or abroad, may have a significant negative impact on the global economy, our employees, facilities, critical equipment, partners, suppliers, distributors or customers and could decrease demand for our products, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture products or perform services for our customers. We may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for damage or other losses relating to our facilities and equipment.
We rely upon our internal manufacturing, packaging and distribution operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale. Our primary manufacturing and storage

operations are located in California, near major earthquake faults, which makes us susceptible to earthquake and fire risks. A catastrophic event that results in damage to specific equipment that would be difficult to replace, in the destruction or disruption of our research and production facilities or in the disruption of our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. Any disruptions in our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation. We may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the facilities of our suppliers and customers may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such catastrophic events, which may cause disruptions, difficulties or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.
 Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services, damages or losses sustained during shipping or significant increases in prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as FedEx, UPS and FedEx Freight. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a significant service disruption, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our customers’ experience. In the past, some of our products have sustained serious damage in transit such that they were no longer usable. Although we have taken steps to improve our packaging and shipping containers, there is no guarantee our products will not become damaged or lost in transit in the future. If our products are damaged or lost in transit, it may result in a substantial delay in the fulfillment of our customer’s order and, depending on the type and extent of the damage, it may result in a substantial financial loss. If our products are not delivered in a timely, cost-effective fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease using our products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
If we are unable to continue to hire and retain skilled personnel, we will have trouble developing and marketing our products.
We are highly dependent, and our success depends largely, upon the continued service of our management and scientific staff and our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, scientific, engineering, management and marketing personnel, who deliver high quality and timely services to our customers and keep pace with cutting-edge technologies and developments in biology and manufacturing. We also face significant competition in the hiring and retention of such personnel from other companies, other providers of outsourced biologics services, research and academic institutions, government and other organizations who have superior funding and resources. Each of our executive officers may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain skilled personnel could materially adversely affect the development of our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or employees.
In addition, we rely on consultants to assist us in developing and implementing engineering and operational advancements. Our consultants and advisors may be contracted by companies other than ours and therefore may have commitments that may limit their availability to us.
Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture and our business may be harmed.
We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a critical contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire aggressively as we expand. If we do not continue to develop our corporate culture or maintain and preserve our guiding principles as we grow and evolve, we may be unable to foster the innovation, curiosity,

creativity, focus on execution, teamwork and the facilitation of critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing we believe we need to support our growth. The ongoing growth in the number of our employees and the complexity of our organization may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.
Until very recently, we have not invested in marketing and selling our products. If we are unable to build a successful commercial (product development, marketing, and sales) function, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.
We currently have limited commercialization expertise and have only recently begun to invest in our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. These activities will require significant expenditures, management resources and time. We compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified marketing and sales personnel. Competition for employees capable of marketing and selling our products and services within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build efficient and effective marketing and sales organizations, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability.
We may enter into additional distribution arrangements and marketing alliances for certain products and services and any failure to successfully identify and implement these arrangements on favorable terms, if at all, may impair our ability to effectively distribute and market our products.
 We may pursue additional arrangements regarding the sales, marketing and distribution of one or more of our products and our future revenue may depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain arrangements with other companies having sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and the ability of such companies to successfully market and sell any such products. Any failure to enter into such arrangements and marketing alliances on favorable terms, if at all, could delay or impair our ability to distribute or market our products and could increase our costs of distribution and marketing. Any use of distribution arrangements and marketing alliances to commercialize our products will subject us to a number of risks, including the following:
 ▪we may be required to relinquish important rights to our products;
 ▪we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators may devote to the distribution or marketing of our products;
 ▪our distributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties; and
 ▪business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator’s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement.
 Our success depends on the market acceptance of our bacterial cell culture media, specialized chromatography solutions and molecular biology reagents, which we manufacture subject to GMP regulatory requirements. Our bacterial cell culture media, specialized chromatography solutions and molecular biology reagents may not achieve or maintain significant commercial market acceptance.
Our commercial success is dependent upon our ability to continue to successfully market and sell our bacterial cell culture media, specialized chromatography solutions and molecular biology reagents, which are manufactured subject to GMP regulatory requirements. Our ability to achieve and maintain commercial market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:
▪our ability to increase awareness of the capabilities of our technology and solutions; 
 ▪our ability to continue to quickly produce and deliver custom-made formulations to our customers that scale to clinical use; 
 ▪our ability to maintain compliance with GMP regulatory requirements for certain of our products; 
 ▪our ability to assess and determine, consistent with the interpretation of the FDA and similar regulatory bodies, the regulatory categories and status of our product offerings which may develop and change over time and to obtain any regulatory clearances or approvals, if and/or when required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities; 


▪our customers’ willingness to adopt new products, services and technologies; 
 ▪whether our products reliably provide advantages over legacy and other alternative technologies and are perceived by customers to be cost effective; 
 ▪our ability to execute on our strategy to scale-up our technology and manufacturing capabilities to meet increasing demand; 
 ▪the rate of adoption of our products by biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and others; 
 ▪the relative reliability and robustness of our products as a whole;
 ▪our ability to develop new tools and solutions for customers; 
 ▪whether competitors develop and commercialize products and services that provide comparable features and benefits at scale; 
 ▪whether competitors effectively link their instruments and/or capital equipment to their reagents; 
 ▪the impact of our investments in product innovation and commercial growth; and 
 ▪negative publicity regarding our or our competitors’ products resulting from defects or errors.
 We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these criteria or other criteria that might affect the market acceptance of our products. If we are unsuccessful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.
Our long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and introduce and market new products and services successfully.
 Our business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing products and our development of new products and services utilizing our current or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products and services or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing products, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products or services will achieve, if any. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new products and services in the future. Consistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements, we expect to continue to use a substantial amount of capital for product development and refinement. We may need additional capital for product development and refinement than is available on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
 ▪correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;
 ▪allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;
 ▪anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations;
 ▪innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets we serve;
 ▪successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time; and
 ▪convince our customers to adopt new technologies.
 In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue.

Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.
 The market may not be receptive to our new products and services upon their introduction.
 We expect a portion of our future revenue growth to come from introducing new products to support the growing cell and gene therapy market and the increasing use of mRNA vaccines and therapies. The commercial success of all of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the life science and biopharmaceutical industries. Some of the products and services that we are developing are based upon new technologies or approaches. As a result, there can be no assurance that these new products and services, even if successfully developed and introduced, will be accepted by customers. If customers do not adopt our new products, services and technologies, our results of operations may suffer and, as a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.
 Due to the significant resources required to enable access in new markets, we must make strategic and operational decisions to prioritize certain markets, technology offerings or partnerships, and there can be no assurance that we will expend our resources in a way that results in meaningful revenue or capitalizes on potential new markets.
 We believe our products have potential applications across a wide range of markets and we have targeted certain markets in which we believe we have a higher probability of success or revenue opportunity or for which the path to commercialize products and realizing or achieving revenue is shorter. However, due to the significant resources required for the development of applications for new markets, we must make decisions regarding which markets to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular markets or applications may not lead to the development of any viable products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our potential decisions to delay or terminate efforts to address, or to collaborate with third parties in respect of, certain markets may subsequently also prove to have been suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. In particular, if we are unable to develop additional relevant products and applications for markets such as the cell and gene therapy market, it could slow or stop our business growth and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
 Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
 Addressable market estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. These estimates and forecasts are based on a number of complex assumptions and third-party estimates and other business data, including assumptions and estimates relating to our ability to generate revenue from existing products and the development of new products and services. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted by us, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all.
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, limit sales of our existing products and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.
Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development, production, distribution, and sale of biotechnology products. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our products and product liability lawsuits may allege that our products failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. If any of our products harm people due to our negligence, willful misconduct, unlawful activities or material breach, or if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in the following, any of which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects:


▪decreased demand for our products and any products or services that we may develop in the future; 
 ▪injury to our reputation; 
 ▪costs to defend the related litigation; 
 ▪loss of revenue; and 
 ▪the inability to commercialize products that we may develop.
 We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions and may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims or the potential loss of revenue that may result. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.
We are subject to stringent and evolving data privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards, as well as policies and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and changes in these could adversely affect our business.
 We are subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personal information. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Additionally, if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of information, we could be found to have breached our contracts.
 In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, and federal and state health information privacy and consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. These laws continue to change and evolve and are increasing in breadth and impact. Many states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California residents and provide such residents with new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. Further, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) through a ballot measure. The CPRA will amend the CCPA, giving California residents additional control over their personal information and imposing further obligations on businesses processing the personal information of California residents. The CPRA includes the creation of a privacy-specific enforcement agency, the first of its kind in any U.S. state, which will be responsible for enforcing the new law. The CPRA takes effect on January 1, 2023. These laws subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and overall risk. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new federal data protection and privacy law to which we would become subject, if it is enacted. Without an overarching federal law driving privacy compliance in the U.S., however, the risk is high of a patchwork of privacy legislation formed by individual state laws, similar to the patchwork created by differing state data breach notification obligations. Requirements to comply with varying state laws not only increase costs for compliance, but also create the potential for enforcement by individual state attorneys general.
 Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure, security and cross-border transmission of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data privacy and information security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on data privacy and information security issues that have the potential to affect our business. To the extent applicable, we are, or could be subject to these laws, rules, and regulations, and, we cannot guarantee that we are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.
 We use third-party credit card processors to process payments from our customers. Through our agreements with our third-party credit card processors, we are subject to payment card association operating rules, including the

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which governs a variety of areas, including how consumers and customers may use their cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions, including liability in the event of a data breach. Any change in these rules or standards and related requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Additionally, any data breach or failure to hold certain information in accordance with PCI-DSS may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 It is possible that the laws governing data privacy and information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws regarding data privacy and information security could expose us to penalties under such laws, orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or other liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 Our internal computer systems, or those of our vendors, customers, or contractors, have been and may in the future be subject to cyberattacks or security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our vendors, customers and contractors, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. We and our vendors, including security and infrastructure vendors, manage and maintain our data using a combination of on-site systems and cloud-based data centers. We face a number of risks related to protecting information, including inappropriate use or disclosure, unauthorized access or acquisition, or inappropriate modification of information. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyberattacks also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause unauthorized payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient, or to permit unauthorized access to systems. A material cyberattack or security incident could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store data that we are required to protect, including, among other things, personal information about our employees, credit card data, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. Any cyberattack or security incident that leads to unauthorized access, acquisition, use or disclosure of personal or proprietary information could harm our reputation, cause us not to comply with U.S. federal and/or state, or non-U.S., data breach notification laws, or our contractual obligations, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, we could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information systems and networks and those of our vendors, including personal information of our employees, and company, customer and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties have previously attempted and may in the future attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of our vendors to disclose information in order to gain access to our data and/or systems or make unauthorized payments to third parties. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our information technology systems or those of our vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and our reputation and credibility could be damaged.
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover losses associated with security incidents, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all of the types of costs, expenses and losses we could incur to address a security incident. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of

these issues or to alleviate problems caused by the same. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals and groups in private litigation related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely and there can be no assurance that any measures we take will prevent cyberattacks or security incidents that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, and failure.
 To conduct our business, we rely on information technology systems, networks and services, many of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. System failure, malfunction, or loss of data that is housed in the Company’s or its third-party service providers’ critical information systems could disrupt our ability to perform critical functions, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, financial position, and cash flows. Our information systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to a number of other reasons, including power outages or other catastrophic events. As a result, we may experience interruptions in our ability to manage our daily operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our investments in significant information technology infrastructure may cause disruptions to or failure of our systems and may interfere with our operations.
 We are currently making investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Implementing new systems involves significant potential risks, including that a system may fail to operate as designed, cause potential loss or corruption of data or information, result in changes to security processes, produce cost overruns, cause implementation delays, disrupt operations, and potentially interfere with management’s ability to meet business needs and reporting requirements. We rely on third-party service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services. Significant information technology infrastructure investments and implementation projects are long-term in nature and may take more time to complete and cost more than we expect, and they may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties with which we interact.
 Changes in political, economic or governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
 We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. The U.S. and international healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that could significantly affect the drug development process, research and development costs and the pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. Any significant change in regulations could have an adverse effect on both our customers’ business and our business, which could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increases in our expenses. For example, we provide products used for basic research and input components used by biopharmaceutical customers for further processing.
 Changes in the FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct and fund clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the products we provide these customers. Additionally, the U.S. government and governments worldwide have increased efforts to expand healthcare coverage while at the same time curtailing and better controlling the increasing costs of healthcare. If cost-containment efforts limit our customers’ profitability, they may

decrease research and development spending, which could decrease the demand for our products and materially adversely affect our growth prospects. Any of these factors could harm our customers’ businesses, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 We are subject to financial, operating, legal and compliance risk associated with global operations.
 We engage in limited business globally, with approximately 3% and 4% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, coming from outside the U.S. However, one of our strategies is to expand geographically, both through distribution and through direct sales. We may also seek to expand geographically by acquiring complementary businesses outside of the U.S. This will subject us to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on income earned by foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, disclosure, security and cross-border transmission of personal information; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.
 Laws and regulations applicable to international transactions are often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our reputation. We expect to incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S.
 We may expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations that either do, or likely will, apply to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Travel Act, and the UK Bribery Act 2010, which prohibit improper payments or offers of payment by us for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we intend to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. Any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties.
 Future acquisitions may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.
We may, in the future, make selected opportunistic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. Any acquisition involves numerous risks, uncertainties and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects:
 ▪difficulties in integrating new operations, systems, technologies, products, services and personnel of acquired businesses effectively;
 ▪problems maintaining uniform procedures, controls and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems;
 ▪lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings, including enhanced revenue, technology, human resources, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies;
 ▪difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations, including risks associated with entering foreign markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;


▪underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;
 ▪negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;
 ▪the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;
 ▪declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of businesses that we acquire, which may result from changes in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired business;
 ▪claims by terminated employees and stockholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;
 ▪the assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;
 ▪the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities to finance, or as consideration for, any acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders;
 ▪the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities to finance, or as consideration for, any acquisitions may not be an option if the price of our common stock is low or volatile, which could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions;
 ▪acquisitions financed with borrowings could increase our leverage and interest expense, which could make us more vulnerable to business downturns;
 ▪any collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangement may require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;
 ▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of management’s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;
 ▪inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;
 ▪the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies;
 ▪assumption of, or exposure to, historical liabilities of the acquired business, including unknown contingent or similar liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify, litigation-related liabilities and regulatory compliance or accounting issues, and potential litigation or regulatory action arising from a proposed or completed acquisition;
 ▪the need to later divest acquired assets at a loss if an acquisition does not meet our expectations; and
 ▪risks associated with acquiring intellectual property, including potential disputes regarding acquired companies’ intellectual property.
 In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant effort and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. We may not be able to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals and the availability of capital. Even if we are able to complete acquisitions in the future, there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will be successful or profitable. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions in a reasonable time frame, or at all.


We and our customers’ respective business operations are and will continue to be subject to extensive government laws and regulations, and assessing the applicability and relevant requirements of, and maintaining compliance with, these laws and regulations can be expensive and time consuming.
 We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. We offer certain products that may be deemed medical devices and become subject to related regulation. Additionally, we provide products used by third parties for the development and commercialization of drug therapies, novel vaccines, and molecular diagnostics by biopharmaceutical companies, life science research companies, CROs, CDMOs, in vitro diagnostics franchises, laboratories, and academic and government research institutions that are also subject to an extensive range of regulatory requirements.
 The quality of our products is critical to our customers, including researchers looking to develop novel vaccines and drug therapies and for biopharmaceutical customers who use our products as components in their preclinical studies and clinical trials. Biopharmaceutical customers are subject to extensive regulations by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries for conducting clinical trials and commercializing products for therapeutic or diagnostic use. This regulatory scrutiny results in our customers imposing rigorous quality requirements on us as their supplier through supplier qualification processes and customer contracts, including quality agreements. Regulatory authorities and our customers may conduct scheduled or unscheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our regulatory compliance or compliance with our quality agreements with our customers. There are significant risks at each stage of the regulatory scheme for our customers.
 Regulatory agencies may in the future take action against us or our customers for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials and the development and testing of diagnostic and therapeutic products, as well as requirements to fall within certain regulatory categories to qualify for exemption from marketing authorization, or where applicable to obtain clearance, authorization, or approval prior to marketing of regulated products. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant.
 We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 Establishing policies, procedures, and monitoring and oversight with consideration of both legal requirements and industry best practices in these areas are costly and time consuming. Defending against any actions for non-compliance of such laws can also be costly, time consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 Our products could become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our products, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 We make certain of our products available to customers as RUO products. RUO products belong to a separate regulatory classification under a long-standing FDA regulation. From an FDA perspective, products that are intended for research use only and are labeled as RUO are not regulated by the FDA as in vitro diagnostic devices

for clinical use, and are therefore not subject to those specific regulatory requirements. RUO products may be used or distributed for research use without first obtaining FDA clearance, authorization or approval. The products must bear the statement: “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.” RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. Accordingly, a product labeled RUO but intended or promoted for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and subject to FDA enforcement action. The FDA will consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed and to whom, when determining its intended use. The FDA could disagree with our assessment that our products are properly marketed as RUO, or could conclude that products labeled as RUO are actually intended for clinical diagnostic use, and could take enforcement action against us, including requiring us to stop distribution of our products until we are in compliance with applicable regulations, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In the event that the FDA requires us to obtain marketing authorization of our RUO products in the future, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant any clearance or approval requested by us in a timely manner, or at all. Our raw material products are manufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 13485:2016. Additionally, products we offer as “GMP-grade” raw material products that we voluntarily manufacture consistent with GMP requirements also follow ISO 13485:2016 standards. We believe these raw material products, including our raw material products offered as “GMP-grade,” are exempt from compliance with FDA regulatory requirements, given that we do not believe they are finished devices as our raw material products are further processed by our customers. Our products are provided to customers under contracts and purchase orders that outline quality standards and product specifications. As products advance through the clinical phases, requirements become more stringent and we work with customers to define and agree on requirements and risks associated with their product.
 The FDA could disagree with our assessment that our products are exempt from current GMP regulations. In addition, the FDA could conclude that the raw material and biologics components products we provide to our customers are actually subject to the pharmaceutical or drug quality-related regulations for manufacturing, processing, packing or holding of drugs or finished pharmaceuticals, and could take enforcement action against us, including requiring us to stop distribution of our products until we are in compliance with applicable regulations, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In the future, we may receive a customer request that an RUO product be available for manufacturing and not research use only, or receive notification from the FDA requiring us to comply with certain FDA regulations for our raw material and biologics components products. As a result, there can be no assurance that the FDA will find our operations are in compliance in a timely manner, or at all, and our results of operations may suffer.
 We rely on assumptions, estimates and data to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
 In addition to our financial results, our management regularly reviews a number of operating and financial metrics, including a breakdown of product revenue into Lab Essentials revenue, Clinical Solutions revenue and Sample Transport revenue, revenue by customer market (pharmaceutical/biotechnology, and academia, government, distributors and healthcare providers), average sale price by product, orders per day, quotes per day, delivery times, order type, new customer metrics, and status of pipeline opportunities that represent potential customers, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. As both the industry in which we operate and our businesses continue to evolve, so too might the metrics by which we evaluate our businesses and the Company. In addition, while the calculation of the metrics we use is based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates, our internal tools are not independently verified by a third party and have a number of limitations and, furthermore, our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, for example, the industry breakdown of our customer revenue by government, pharma/bio and academia sales. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these metrics.
 We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.
We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate

the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately 21% of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial results for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. We may be required in the future to record charges to earnings if our goodwill, intangible assets or other investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.
Changes in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require us to make changes to our systems, processes and internal controls, which could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and internal controls, cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, retroactively affect previously reported results or require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems upon our following the adoption of these standards.
For example, during February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases and its related interpretations, codified as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 (ASC 842). The updated standard requires lessees to generally recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective with respect to the Company beginning January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We expect that most of the operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of approximately $20 million upon adoption of ASC 842, which will increase the Company’s total assets and total liabilities that are reported relative to such amounts prior to adoption.
 Our revenue recognition and other factors may impact our financial results in any given period and make them difficult to predict.
 Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), we recognize revenue when our performance obligations have been satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those performance obligations. Our revenue primarily includes revenue from the sale of manufactured products, including products from our catalog or available for purchase on our website and custom manufactured products (such as custom bacterial cell culture media and specialized chromatography solutions). Contracts for such sales contain a single performance obligation, namely the delivery of consumable products. Our application of ASC 606 with respect to the nature of future contractual arrangements could impact the forecasting of our revenue for future periods, as both the mix of products we will sell in a given period, as well as the size of contracts, is difficult to predict.
 Furthermore, the presentation of our financial results requires us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect revenue recognition. In some instances, we could reasonably use different estimates and assumptions, and changes in estimates may occur from period to period. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition.”
 Given the foregoing factors, comparing our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results may not be indicative of our future performance.
 Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.7 million of U.S. federal and $11.7 million of state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards available to reduce taxable income in future years. Our ability to utilize those NOLs may be

limited based on our operating performance and tax laws in effect. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.
Separately, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.
Our business is subject to risks relating to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or regulations. The costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are significant. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, of current or future environmental, health and safety laws or regulations and the cost of compliance with any resulting order or fine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our management has limited experience in operating a public company.
 Our executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage its ongoing transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of our business.
We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the U.S. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the U.S. may require costs greater than expected. We have recently hired, and will continue to hire, employees whose skills and training are required to develop and carryout the accounting, financial reporting, legal, compliance and internal control policies and practices required of public companies in the U.S. These additional employees will increase our operating cost in future periods.
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe or have disclosed their intellectual property or proprietary information, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our current and future proprietary products. We rely primarily upon a combination of trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology, manufacturing processes, and products. Our commercial success depends in part on obtaining and maintaining trade secret protection of our current and future products, if any, and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending such trade secrets against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have valid and enforceable intellectual property rights that cover these activities.

Although we do not currently own any issued patents or patent applications covering our proprietary products or manufacturing processes we may, in the future, file patent applications or acquire or license intellectual property rights including patents and patent applications. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, we or our collaborators may only pursue, obtain or maintain patent protection in a limited number of countries. Even if patents do successfully issue, such patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our current or future product and service offerings, prevent others from designing around our claims or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.
 Additionally, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of our intellectual property rights, including the unauthorized use or reproduction of our manufacturing or other trade secrets. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 We rely primarily on trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our technologies. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our technology, the value of our technology and products could be materially adversely affected.
 In addition to trade secret protection, we also rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, collaborators, CDMOs, CROs and others to protect our technology and other proprietary information. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or entity or made known to the individual or entity by us during the course of the individual’s or entity’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees as well as our personnel policies also generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property or that we may obtain full rights to such inventions at our election. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect.
 Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, collaborators, CDMOs, CROs and others may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors, notwithstanding the existence of a valid confidentiality or similar non-disclosure agreement. We also face the risk that present or former employees could continue to hold rights to intellectual property used by us, demand the registration of intellectual property rights in their name, and seek payment of damages for our use of such intellectual property.
 Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained or is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. We may not have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the case of a breach of any such agreements and our trade secrets and other proprietary information could be disclosed to third parties, including our competitors. Many of our partners also collaborate with our competitors and other third parties. The disclosure of our trade secrets to our competitors, or more broadly, would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our rights, and failure to maintain trade-secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior knowledge, methods and know-how, and the existence of our own trade secrets affords no protection against such independent discovery.


If we are sued for infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our current or future products.
 Our products may infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, one or more claims of an issued patent or may fall within the scope of one or more claims in a published patent application that may be subsequently issued and to which we do not hold a license or other rights.
 Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain whether others have filed patent applications for technology that we were the first to invent. Others, including our competitors, may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over any future patent applications or patents that we may file or obtain, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents by others covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.
 Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our current or future products or the use of our current or future products. After issuance, the scope of patent claims remains subject to construction based on interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.
 The life sciences industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Third parties have, and may in the future have, U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications that may cover our current or future products. Such a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party’s patent rights and may go to court or a tribunal to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our current or future products. In the event that any of these patent rights were asserted against us, we believe that we may have defenses against any such action, including that such patents would not be infringed by our current or future products and/or that such patents are not valid. However, if any such patent rights were to be asserted against us and our defenses to such assertion were unsuccessful, unless we obtain a license to the patents concerned, we could be liable for damages, which could be significant and include treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed. We could also be precluded from commercializing any future products that were ultimately held to infringe such patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
If we are found to infringe the patent rights of a third party, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. In particular, any of our competitors that control intellectual property that we are found to infringe may be unwilling to provide us a license under any terms. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a

result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. Further, if a patent infringement suit is brought against us or our third-party service providers and if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our current or future products, or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis, and may delay or require us to abandon our development, manufacturing or sales activities relating to our current or future products. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our future products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.
 Even if resolved in our favor, intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our, our licensors’ or other third parties’ intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. If not resolved in our favor, litigation may require us to pay any portion of our opponents’ legal fees. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from our participation in patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in certain jurisdictions in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the perceived value of our current or future products or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property and proprietary technology.
 We try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us. We may, however, be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee’s former employer or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these individuals, even those related to one or more of our current or future products, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
 In addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and independent contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, or such agreements may be breached or alleged to be ineffective, and the assignment may not be self-executing, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property or may result in such intellectual property becoming assigned to third parties. If we fail in enforcing or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.


We rely on confidentiality agreements that, if breached, may be difficult to enforce and could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.
 Our policy is to enter agreements relating to the non-disclosure and non-use of confidential information with third parties, including our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them. However, these agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Moreover, to the extent that our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to the intellectual property. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party, and enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable. In addition, we rely primarily on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in large part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:
 ▪these agreements may be breached;
 ▪these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach; or
 ▪our trade secrets or proprietary know-how will otherwise become known.
 Any breach of our confidentiality agreements or our failure to effectively enforce such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.
 If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.
Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names or marks which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.
Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.
 The degree of future protection afforded by our proprietary and intellectual property rights is uncertain because such rights offer only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:
 ▪we do not currently own or license any patents, and others may be able to develop products that are similar to, or better than, our current or future products in a way that is not covered by the claims of the patents we may own or license in the future;
 ▪the trade secret protection that we rely on to protect our proprietary information and know-how does not protect us against any third parties independently developing competing technology;
 ▪we, or our licensing partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by issued patents or pending patent applications that we may own or license in the future;
 ▪we, or our licensing partners or current or future collaborators, might not be the first to file patent applications for certain of our or their inventions;


▪we may choose not to file a patent for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property;
 ▪the patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business; or
 ▪any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found not to be owned by us, invalid or unenforceable.
 Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 We may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our current or future products, and we cannot provide any assurances that we would be able to do so.
 We may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our current or future products, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. If we could not obtain a license, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.
 Licensing of intellectual property involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:
 ▪the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;
 ▪whether, and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;
 ▪our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;
 ▪our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our products, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and
 ▪the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.
 If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain the licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product, or the dispute may have an adverse effect on our results of operation.
 We may, in the future, grant licenses under our intellectual property. Like in licenses, out licenses are complex, and disputes may arise between us and our licensees, such as the types of disputes described above. Moreover, our licensees may breach their obligations, or we may be exposed to liability due to our failure or alleged failure to satisfy our obligations. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business.


Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
In March 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement which provides for loan commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $27.0 million. Our indebtedness, including the indebtedness we have incurred, and may in the future incur, under the Credit Agreement or otherwise, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.
Our indebtedness, the cash flow needed to satisfy our debt and the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement may have important consequences, including:
▪limiting funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures by requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; 
 ▪limiting our ability to incur or prepay existing indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments and make changes in the nature of the business, among other things; 
 ▪making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement, bear variable rates of interest; and 
 ▪making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.
 Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, tax laws, including the disallowance or deferral of tax deductions for interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Further, our Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations that could impose operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business.
We expect to use cash on hand to meet current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service requirements and capital expenditures. The ability to make these payments depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control and as set forth herein.
Despite current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.
We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face could intensify.
The phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.
Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at rates determined using LIBOR as the reference rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted, and currently it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or substantially modified in future years.

On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. We believe that the administrative agent under our Credit Agreement, MidCap Financial Trust, will continue to use the one month USD LIBOR tenor in the ordinary course. However, our Credit Agreement permits the agent in certain circumstances, including upon a determination that the LIBOR rate will no longer be provided or published on a date certain or that no reasonable means will exist for ascertaining such rate, to make adjustments that the agent determines necessary to preserve the current all-in rate of interest. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. Furthermore, we may need to renegotiate our Credit Agreement or incur other indebtedness, and changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of an alternative rate or benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness.
The terms of the Credit Agreement may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.
The Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may, unless waived by the lender, limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:
▪incur additional indebtedness; 
 ▪incur liens; 
 ▪merge, dissolve, liquidate, amalgamate, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
 ▪declare or pay certain dividends, payments or distribution or repurchase or redeem certain capital stock; and 
 ▪make certain investments.
 These restrictions could limit, potentially significantly, our operational flexibility and affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute our business strategy. Our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. If we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lender would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations with respect to such indebtedness.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Telegraph Hill Partners Management Company LLC, through its affiliates THP LP and THP LLC, controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.
THP controls approximately 62.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, which means that THP can control the vote of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This control enables THP to control the election of the members of our board of directors and all other corporate decisions. In particular, for so long as THP continues to own a majority of our common stock, THP will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us. Pursuant to our investors’ rights agreement and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, THP has certain rights, and the ability to take certain actions, that are not otherwise available to all stockholders. For example, our investors’ rights agreement provides THP the right, subject to certain conditions, to demand that we file a registration statement or request that their shares of our common stock be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing. In addition, until such time as THP first ceases to own greater than 50% of the

outstanding voting power of our common stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation effectively provides THP with the ability to fill vacancies on the board, remove directors (with or without cause), call a special meeting of our stockholders, amend our certificate of incorporation (subject to approval of our board of directors) and amend our bylaws. Even when THP ceases to control a majority of the total voting power, for so long as THP continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock, THP will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, for such period of time, THP will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies. The concentration of ownership and availability of the foregoing rights could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of us and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.
 THP and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in our industry generally. In the ordinary course of their business activities, THP and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders, such as investing in or advising businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of THP and its affiliates and any person or entity who, while a stockholder, director, officer or agent of the Company or any of its affiliates, is a director, officer, principal, partner, member, manager, employee, agent and/or other representative of THP and its affiliates (each, an “Identified Person”) has any duty to refrain from (i) engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates are engaged or that are deemed to be competing with us or any of our affiliates or (ii) otherwise investing in or providing services to any person that competes with us or our affiliates engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Identified Person has any obligation to offer to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates the right to participate in any corporate opportunity in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates are engaged or that are deemed to be competing with us or any of our affiliates. This means that THP may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, THP may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you or may not prove beneficial.
Our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, and we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules and listing standards of NASDAQ. As a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections as those afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.
THP controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. For example, controlled companies, within one year of the date of the listing of their common stock:
▪are not required to have a board that is composed of a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under the rules and listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC; 
 ▪are not required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors or have a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and 
 ▪are not required to have director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors or by a nominations committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, and to adopt a written charter or a board resolution addressing the nominations process.
 We utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, certain of these exemptions. For example, a majority of our directors have not been, and, in the future for so long as we rely on such exemptions, will not be, affirmatively determined to be independent nor will our compensation committee or nominating and corporate governance committee of the board be comprised entirely of directors who have been determined to be independent.

Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.
 Because we are a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We remain in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely manner. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.
We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year that coincides with the filing of our second annual report on Form 10-K. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, we expect that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse if it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.
Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price.
To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various costly and time-consuming actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may cause us to fail to timely and accurately report our financial results or result in a material misstatement of our financial statements.
In the past, specifically in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included in the final prospectus to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-256795), filed with the SEC on June 25, 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness resulted from not having internal controls that were designed, documented and executed to support the accurate and timely analysis and reporting of financial results associated with accounting for complex, non-routine transactions under GAAP. Consequently, we inappropriately accounted for our entry into a stock purchase agreement with THP on January 14,

2019, pursuant to which THP acquired majority control of Teknova (the THP Transaction), including as to certain tax benefits and the allocation of transaction costs across periods. See Part II, Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We have begun taking significant measures, and plan to continue to take measures, to remediate this material weakness, however, we cannot assure you that these or other measures will fully remediate the material weakness in a timely manner or prevent future material weaknesses from occurring. As part of our remediation plan to address the material weakness identified above, we are working to hire accounting employees and/or consultants with the specific technical accounting experience necessary to assist with complex, non-routine transactions and implementing and adopting additional control procedures. We believe that the measures we are implementing will remediate the material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.
While we are implementing our plan to remediate the material weakness, we can give no assurance that this implementation will remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. If we identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. If additional material weaknesses exist or are discovered in the future, and we are unable to remediate any such material weaknesses, our reputation, financial condition, and operating results could suffer. Moreover, we could become subject to investigations by regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.
We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” defined in the JOBS Act and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various public reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; the exemption from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor’s report on financial statements; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and not required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we are not subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Additionally, because we have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing

only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company for so long as either (i) the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million as of the end of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) we have annual revenues of less than $100.0 million and the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million as of the end of our second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
Investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.
The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”.
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the listing requirements of NASDAQ and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, and are expected to continue to make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Furthermore, the need to continue to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert our management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made, and are expected to continue to make, some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made, and are expected to continue to make, it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of our management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 Provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the DGCL), contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things, these provisions:

▪allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of other stockholders; 
 ▪provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms; 
 ▪provide that, at any time after THP first ceases to beneficially own more than 50% in voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the THP Trigger Event), directors may only be removed for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; 
 ▪prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the THP Trigger Event; 
 ▪provide that, at any time after the THP Trigger Event, special meetings may only be called by or at the direction of the Chairman of our board of directors, our board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer; 
 ▪provide that, at any time after the THP Trigger Event, any alteration, amendment or repeal, in whole or in part, of any provision of our bylaws by our stockholders will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and 
 ▪establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
 Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. We have expressly elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, until such time as THP beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. At that time, such election shall be automatically withdrawn and we will thereafter be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, except that THP will not be deemed to be an interested stockholder under Section 203 of the DGCL regardless of its percentage ownership of our common stock. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.
These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including actions to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action

asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us, or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (4) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (5) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and (6) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing forum selection provision will not apply to claims arising under the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above.
The forum selection provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. In addition, investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If the enforceability of our forum selection provisions were to be challenged, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such challenge. While we currently have no basis to expect any such challenge would be successful, if a court were to find our forum selection provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of these specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with having to litigate in other jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our employees, management and board of directors.
An active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, which may limit your ability to sell your shares.
Our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on June 25, 2021. Prior to our IPO, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. A public trading market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, which is dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over which neither we nor any market maker has control. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to persist would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-linked securities and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using any such securities as consideration.
A significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock are available for immediate resale and may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. All shares sold in our IPO were freely tradable upon such sale without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act (Rule 144), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates (including THP), which may be sold only in compliance with certain limitations.
 We have 28,012,017 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 21,111,917 (or 75.4%) were subject to a 180 day lock up period provided under lock up agreements executed in connection with our IPO and restricted from

immediate resale under the securities laws. The contractual lock up period pertaining to our IPO expired on December 21, 2021. Upon such expiration, 21,111,917 shares became eligible for sale in the public market, substantially all of which are held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates and will be subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement.
The market price of our stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares of common stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, shares of our common stock that are issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) will become eligible for sale in the public market, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, lock-up agreements and Rule 144, as applicable.
 As of December 31, 2021, there were 322,174, 1,999,254 and 442,684 shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock option awards under the 2016 Stock Plan, as amended (2016 Plan), the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (2020 Plan) and the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (2021 Plan), respectively. In addition, the 2021 Plan and the ESPP provide for annual automatic increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. As of January 1, 2022, a total of 3,698,555 and 570,948 shares of common stock remain available and have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan and our ESPP, respectively. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.
Because we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock and are prohibited from paying cash dividends under the Credit Agreement, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price higher than you paid for it.
We do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the terms of the Credit Agreement prohibit us from paying dividends, other than dividends payable in our stock, without the prior written consent of the lender. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may also be limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities we may issue or any future credit facilities we may enter into. Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market, which may not occur.
We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
 Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, together with the cash generated from our IPO and credit facility under the Credit Agreement, will enable us to fund our operating

expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. However, we may need to raise substantial additional capital to:
 ▪expand the commercialization of our products;
 ▪fund our operations;
 ▪further our research and development; and
 ▪pursue strategic transactions, such as acquisitions.
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
 ▪market acceptance of our products;
 ▪the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;
 ▪revenue and cash flow derived from existing or future collaborations;
 ▪the cost of our research and development activities;
 ▪the cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals;
 ▪the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
 ▪the extent to which we engage in strategic transactions, such as the acquisition of, investment in or disposal of businesses, assets, products and technologies, including inbound or outbound licensing arrangements.
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Further, we are not eligible to file a "short-form" registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act to register our securities in connection with a follow-on, secondary or shelf offering until July 1, 2022. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws, and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers, provide that:
 ▪we will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful;
 ▪we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;


▪we may, in our discretion, advance expenses incurred by our directors and officers in connection with defending or participating in a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;
 ▪we will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification; and
 ▪the rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.
 While we maintain a directors’ and officers’ insurance policy, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur, which may reduce our available funds to satisfy third-party claims and may adversely impact our cash position.
 General Risk Factors
We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate such laws and regulations.
 We are subject to U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations that restrict the shipment or provision of certain products to certain countries, governments and persons. While we take precautions to prevent our products from being exported in violation of these laws, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations may be time consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or impose other costs. Any change in export or import regulations; economic sanctions or related legislation; or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in our decreased ability to export or sell certain products and services to existing or potential customers in affected jurisdictions.
 Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
 We are subject to a variety of tax liabilities, including federal, state and other taxes such as income, sales/use, payroll, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease our net income, the value of any tax loss carryforwards, the value of any tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and our cash flows, and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the relevant taxing authority, which could increase our tax liabilities.
 Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We are currently subject to income taxes in the U.S. only, but our future tax liabilities may be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 
 ▪expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; 
 ▪expansion into foreign jurisdictions that require us to pay local income taxes; 
 ▪expiration of, or detrimental changes in, research and development tax credit laws; or 
 ▪changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.


In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice and guidance may evolve over time. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
 We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 Our employees, consultants, distributors and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading.
We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, consultants, distributors and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on our business. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.
Our operating results and stock price may be volatile. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation.
 Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our common stock to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. Our operating results and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors, including:


▪market conditions in our industry or the broader stock market; 
 ▪actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; 
 ▪introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors; 
 ▪issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations; 
 ▪sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock; 
 ▪additions or departures of key personnel; 
 ▪regulatory or political developments; 
 ▪litigation and governmental investigations; 
 ▪changing economic conditions; 
 ▪investors’ perception of us; 
 ▪events beyond our control such as weather, war and health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 ▪any default on our indebtedness.
 These and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares of common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the Company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they publish unfavorable research or reports, or adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
If a trading market for our common stock develops, the trading market will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. As a newly public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research, issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. Moreover, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
