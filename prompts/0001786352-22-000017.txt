Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to make it simple to connect and do business.
We are champions of small and midsize businesses (SMBs). As a leading provider of cloud-based software that simplifies, digitizes, and automates financial operations for SMBs, we create efficiencies and free our customers to run their businesses. Our vision is to become the leading one-stop solution that helps millions of businesses around the world manage their financial operations.
Bill.com's purpose-built, artificial-intelligence (AI)-enabled financial software platform creates seamless connections between our customers, their suppliers, and their clients. Customers use our platform to generate and process invoices, streamline approvals, make and receive payments, manage employee expenses, sync with their accounting systems, and manage their cash. We have built sophisticated integrations with popular accounting software solutions, banks, card issuers and payment processors, enabling our customers to access these mission-critical services quickly and easily. Divvy, a Bill.com company, provides products for businesses to build budgets, manage payments, and eliminate the need for expense reports. 
As of June 30, 2022, over 157,000 Bill.com customers trusted the Bill.com platform to manage their financial workflows and process their payments, which totaled $219.1 billion in Total Payment Volume (TPV) during fiscal 2022. For the purposes of measuring our key business metrics, we define customers as entities that are either billed directly by us or for which we bill our partners during a particular period. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 4.7 million Bill.com network members have paid or received funds electronically using our platform. We define network members as our customers plus their suppliers and clients. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Business Metrics” for a detailed discussion of our business metrics.
Our Solution
Our platform automates the SMB back office and enables our customers to pay their suppliers and collect payments from their clients, in effect acting as a system of control for their accounts payable, accounts receivable and spend and expense management activities. As a result, our platform frees our customers from cumbersome legacy financial processes and provides the following key benefits:
•Automated and Efficient. Our AI-enabled platform helps our customers pay their bills efficiently and get paid faster. We provide tools that streamline the transaction lifecycle by automating data capture and entry, routing bills for approval, and detecting duplicate invoices.
•Integrated and Accurate. We provide an end-to-end platform that connects our customers to their suppliers and clients. Our platform integrates with accounting software, banks, card issuers, and payment processors, enabling our customers to access all of these mission-critical partners easily. Because we provide a comprehensive view, customers can more easily find inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and fix them quickly.
•Digital and Secure. We enable secure connections and storage of sensitive supplier and client information and documents, such as invoices and contracts, and make them accessible to authorized users on any device, from anywhere.
•Visible and Transparent. With our solutions, customers can easily view their transaction workflows, create budgets and manage spend, enabling them to gain deeper insight into their financial operations and manage their cash flows.
What Sets Us Apart
•Purpose-Built for SMBs. Our platform provides SMBs with core functionality and value-added services generally reserved for larger companies. Through our cloud-based desktop and mobile applications, SMBs can connect and do business from anywhere, any time.
•Diverse Distribution Channels. We leverage both direct and indirect channels - accounting firms, financial institution partners, and accounting software integrations - to efficiently go-to-market.
•Large and Growing Network. As accounts receivable customers issue invoices, and accounts payable customers pay bills, they connect to their clients and suppliers, driving a powerful network effect. This aids our customer acquisition efforts by increasing the number of businesses connected to our platform, which then become prospects.
•Large Data Asset. We have a large data asset as a result of processing millions of documents and billions of dollars in business payments annually for our customers. By leveraging our machine learning capabilities, we generate insights from this data that drive product innovation.
•Proprietary Risk Management Expertise. Leveraging our data, our proprietary risk engine has trained upon millions of business-to-business ACH, check, card, and wire transactions enabling us to keep our customers’ funds secure.
•Experienced Management Team and Vibrant Culture. Our management team has deep experience with SMBs, software-as-a-service companies, accounting firms, and financial institutions. We have built a unique culture that resonates with employees, as evidenced by our highly-competitive low attrition rates.
Our Platform
 Our purpose-built platform leverages the fact that we can see both sides of a transaction and can easily connect both transaction parties and promote the rapid exchange of information and funds, with strong network effects and greater monetization opportunities as more customers adopt our platform. Our platform also expands the ability of our spend and expense management customers to budget for, monitor, and approve employee expenses across organizations of all sizes - all in real-time. 
Accounts Payable Automation
Our accounts payable automation service streamlines the entire payables process, from the receipt of a bill, through the approvals workflow, to the payment and synchronization with the accounting system. Here are some highlights of our service:
•Visibility at a Glance – Through our platform, our customers gain a comprehensive view of their cash in-flows and outflows.
•Document Management – Bill.com automatically assigns a dedicated email address to each customer to provide to its suppliers. Suppliers use that email address to send invoices to the customer’s dedicated Bill.com inbox. Alternatively, scanned invoices can be uploaded directly through our application. Once uploaded, we store the bills securely, linking them to the associated supplier. With a single click, customers can use our search feature to scan documents quickly and resolve open questions. Our document management capabilities help our customers make payment decisions, answer supplier questions and provide support to accountants and auditors. 
•Intelligent bill capture – We have automated the capture of data from bills by leveraging our proprietary AI capabilities. Incoming bills are machine-read, and critical data fields, including due date, amount, and supplier name, are prepopulated. The customer's Accounts Payable staff can review the result and make any adjustments required, and our platform routes the bill internally for approval.
•Digital workflows and approvals – Our platform speeds approval processes through policy-driven workflows. Much of this activity takes place while our customers are on-the-go: one of 
the top three uses of our mobile app is bill approvals. Our platform proactively suggests payment dates based upon a bill’s due date, helping customers avoid late payment penalty fees. Our customers assign each user a role: administrator, payor, approver, clerk, or accountant. Each role has its own entitlements to ensure appropriate checks and balances in the back office.
•Collaboration and engagement – Our platform promotes collaboration. Our in-app messaging capabilities make communications between our customers and their employees, vendors, and clients, easy. For example, Bill.com allows administrators and payors to remind approvers to act, or delegate payment authority when a key employee is unavailable. Our platform creates a clear audit trail that becomes invaluable in the event of an audit, or for tax compliance.
Accounts Receivable Automation
Our accounts receivable service automates the entire process, from the creation of an invoice and delivery to the client, to funds collection and synchronization back to the accounting system. Here are some highlights of this service:
•Easy invoicing – Using a simple template, customers can easily create electronic invoices on our platform and insert their own logos to customize them. If required, our platform also enables the printing and mailing of paper invoices. Many accounts receivable customers take advantage of our recurring invoice feature.
•Digital workflows and visibility – Our platform automates and simplifies electronic invoice creation, delivery, and collection of funds. Using our progress bar, customers have complete visibility into the accounts receivable process. When both trading partners are in the network, our customer can see when their invoices are delivered, opened, authorized to be paid and when payment was received. Invoices and supporting documents like contracts are readily accessible and notes can be entered for future reference. 
•Collaboration and engagement – To make paying an invoice easy, we offer a customizable, branded client payment portal. Clients receive a link to an electronic invoice accessible on the Bill.com site. From this portal, the client can make a payment via ACH or credit card within seconds. In a May 2021 customer survey that we conducted, more than half (or 66% of respondents) reported that using our platform allows them to get paid at least twice as fast compared to other accounts receivable methods. For reference purposes, the client has ongoing access to bills and associated payments within the portal. Just like our accounts payable service, our in-app collaboration tools make communications between the accounts receivable customer and its clients easy and trackable.
Spend and Expense Management
With Divvy, spending businesses gain robust spend and expense management tools, helping them spend smarter. Divvy provides businesses full visibility into their spend, by issuing every employee their own Divvy card. Every card provides access to credit lines originated through our card issuing partner banks and is linked to proactive spend controls: managers control their budgets by team through the assignment of individual permissions. Employees can request funds from their phones, and budget owners or admins can approve or deny spend requests on-the-go from a push notification to their phone.
Spending businesses can leverage a single, centralized budget or opt for a more sophisticated scenario, where budgets are established by department, team, or project. Rather than building a business budgeting strategy using outdated numbers in a static spreadsheet, Divvy’s budgeting software syncs automatically with the employee's Mastercard or Visa cards, while also facilitating reimbursements and vendor spend. With Divvy’s intuitive web and mobile applications, budget owners can drill down into spending by department, team, project, or individual. Whether on-the-go or in the office, an SMB can view up-to-date spend against budgets, so they always know where they stand.
We market Divvy cards to potential spending businesses and issue business-purpose charge cards through our partnerships with card issuing banks (Issuing Banks). When a business applies for a Divvy card, we utilize, on behalf of the card Issuing Bank, proprietary risk management capabilities to confirm the identity of the 
business, and perform a credit underwriting process to determine if the business is eligible for a Divvy card pursuant to our credit policies. Once approved for a Divvy card, the spending business is provided a credit limit and can use the Divvy software to request virtual cards or physical cards.
Payment Services
Our suite of comprehensive payment services includes:
•ACH Payments – We enable ACH transactions for both disbursements and collections. Our network makes it simple to make the switch from paper checks.
•Card Payments – Through a third party, we offer accounts receivable customers the convenience of accepting credit and debit card payments. In addition, we enable our accounts payable customers to make virtual card payments. Virtual cards enable faster payments to suppliers along with the data needed to easily match incoming payments with open receivables. Through card issuing partners, Divvy provides both physical and virtual Mastercard and Visa debit and credit cards to companies that enroll in its business spend and expense management program.
•Real-time Payments (RTP) – Through The Clearing House’s RTP® network, a real-time payments platform, we disburse funds rapidly to meet urgent customer funding needs. We also facilitate near real-time payments to customers’ debit cards via a service offered with a partner.
•Checks – We issue checks if our customer prefers or is contractually obligated to pay via this method. By design, we protect our SMB customers against check fraud by never disclosing their bank account details to a supplier and by reviewing every check presented against a check issue file to detect and prevent check fraud.
•Cross-Border Payments – We simplify cross-border disbursements by facilitating electronic funds transfers around the world with our International Payments service. Payments can be issued in either U.S. or foreign currency, and our platform synchronizes with customers’ accounting software for a consolidated view of domestic and international outflows. We offer our U.S.-based customers the ability to disburse funds to over 130 countries worldwide.
Value-Added Services
•Two-Way Sync with Leading Accounting Systems – Our platform automatically synchronizes customers, suppliers, general ledger accounts, and transactions with an SMB’s accounting system to automate reconciliation. We are integrated with several of the most popular business accounting software applications, including QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Xero, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, and Microsoft Dynamics GP. Our two-way synchronization capabilities virtually eliminate double data-entry, as our platform and the customer’s accounting software continuously keep each other updated. Customers who use other types of systems use our advanced file import/export capabilities to minimize data entry activities.
•Purchase Order (PO) Matching – We sync POs directly from accounting software systems, including Oracle NetSuite, Sage Intacct, and Microsoft Dynamics Great Plains into our platform. Users can compare POs and invoices on one screen, then route bills for approval and payment seamlessly in the same workflow. This eliminates the need to switch between systems for two-way matching and reduces the back-and-forth communication between PO creators and AP managers.
•Frequent Status Updates – We provide timely status updates of financial inflows and outflows by providing timely status of all transactions on a regular basis. Through our workflow progress bars on each page, our customers can see who has approved an invoice and what approvals remain, the status of each payment, and the date transactions are expected to clear.
•Treasury Services – Our platform integrates advanced treasury services tools that are normally either not offered to or are costly for SMBs. Examples include:
◦the positive pay feature we employ to ensure only authorized payment transactions are processed;
◦a streamlined void and reissue function when an in-process payment needs to be cancelled; and
◦the cleared check images we make available to enable our customers to confirm payment receipt and facilitate research.
•Custom User Roles – Our platform enables customers to define custom user roles. These roles can be used to expand or limit each user’s access to the platform and core financial operations functions. For example, a customer can temporarily enable its auditors or tax preparers to access our platform using a custom role that allows them to view source documents in support of the services they are providing, but not have access to other confidential documents or information.
•Document Discovery – With our advanced document management capabilities, a customer can easily search for an uploaded document and search its data elements, regardless of how old it is, or how long it has been in our system. Our customers utilize this feature when deciding whether to pay a given bill, re-issue an invoice, or determine who authorized a certain payment. 
•Integrated, Robust Mobile Functionality - Our mobile-native apps, available in both iOS and Android, are easy to adopt and use. Through our apps, our customers can manage their transaction workflows, send an invoice, make payments on-the-go and manage spend. 
Partner Integrations 
We provide our financial institution partners a technology platform that enables a white-label integration with their existing business banking services. We deliver single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, integrated provisioning and entitlement of new accounts, as well as integration with required compliance systems. Transactions are synchronized automatically between the financial institution’s platform and ours, keeping the customer’s view current and consistent.
In addition to our white-labeled solution, we support a broad range of partners and customers with our platform application programming interfaces (APIs). These APIs allow our partners to integrate our platform seamlessly into their solutions, create web or mobile apps that integrate with ours, or leverage our payments capabilities. Through our APIs, developers can:
•interact with business entities, like suppliers and clients;
•obtain summary-level reports, such as payables and receivables reports; and
•interact with accounting details, such as the general ledger codes of the chart of accounts.
Our Unique Data Asset
Bill.com's total payment volume and number of documents processed for our customers provides us with a unique data asset. This asset has allowed us to build powerful artificial intelligence capabilities. The data provides a view into customer transactions and operational status of various payment processes, which enables us to effectively manage risk exposure. Our system continues to learn with each document processed and payment made. This virtuous cycle of learning powers a network effect that facilitates customer satisfaction, offers intelligent insights, improves trust and safety, and will fuel further growth.
Our Network
Through our AI-enabled platform, our customers can easily connect with existing network members. The benefit of being in the network is simple: customers connect with others to pay and be paid electronically, freeing them from the need to solicit or share bank account and routing numbers with each trading partner individually. The process of adding bank account details to our platform is easy and secure. For example, when a supplier of an accounts payable customer receives an invitation to join our network, the supplier can accept and securely share their bank account details once with Bill.com. From that point onward, all payments to that supplier will be electronic.
Once in the network, other Bill.com customers can easily link to that same supplier without the supplier having to repeat this process again. This approach to connecting businesses has allowed us to build a robust 
and growing business-to-business payments directory, which includes approximately 4.7 million Bill.com network members as of June 30, 2022. We define network members as our customers plus their suppliers and clients, who pay and receive funds electronically via our platform. These network effects promote greater adoption of our platform, higher levels of engagement, and increased value across our ecosystem. 
Payment and Risk Management Services
Our payments engine powers our payment services. Through dedicated connections with banks and payment processors, we issue checks, initiate card-based transactions, originate ACH-based payments, and execute wire transfers. Our payments engine handles all aspects of payment file transfers, exception file handling, and required payment status reporting. We have redundancy across our core payment methods such that if there is an outage with one payment processor, we can direct payments to an alternative provider.
Through our risk engine, we use both proprietary and third-party tools to assess, detect, and mitigate financial risk associated with the payment volume that we process. Throughout the transaction lifecycle, we monitor data and payments to ensure that we are safeguarding our customers, their suppliers and clients, and our company. When a bank account is added to the platform, we validate that the bank account is held at a U.S.-domiciled financial institution, is associated with the organization adding the account, and is in good standing.
When customers use our services, we monitor key activities looking for signals that would indicate anomalies that could create risk exposure and need to be investigated. Our risk engine analyzes many unique data elements to score transactions. Those that score above our thresholds are routed to trained risk agents for manual review. Agents have the latitude to contact customers to gather further information, or if a financial risk is imminent, to prevent funds from leaving our system until any suspicious activity can be resolved.
Once a payment transaction is processed, we continue to manage our exposure. We have extensive contacts in the banking industry, and we utilize these to reverse payments when possible. If a suspicious or fraudulent payment cannot be reversed, we follow a rigorous collections process to recover funds.
This risk management process gets progressively more insightful as our data set gets larger and our AI-enabled risk engine gets smarter. This is an advantage that we expect to continue to grow over time. Our success in managing the risk inherent in moving funds for business customers is proven. As a percentage of our TPV, fraud and credit loss rates for our Bill.com based payment services were nominal, less than one basis point for each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a percentage of total card payment volume transacted by spending businesses that use Divvy cards, fraud and credit loss rate was approximately 37 basis points for fiscal 2022. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Business Metrics” for a detailed discussion of our business metrics.
Security, Privacy, and Data Protection
Trust is important for our relationship with customers and partners, and we take significant measures designed to protect their privacy and the data that they provide to us. Keeping our customers’ data safe and secure is a high priority. Our approach to security includes data governance as well as ongoing testing for potential security issues.
We have robust access controls in our production environment with access to data strictly assigned, monitored, and audited. To ensure our controls remain up-to-date, we undergo continuous external testing for vulnerabilities within our software architecture. These efforts have enabled us to certify our platform to SOC1 Type II, SOC2 Type II, and SOC3 standards. Our security program is aligned to the NIST-800-53 standards and is regularly audited and assessed by third parties as well as our partners.
The focus of our program is working to prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers and network members. To this end, our team of security practitioners work to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve.
These steps include close attention to network security, classifying and inventorying data, limiting and authorizing access controls, and multi- factor authentication for access to systems. We also employ regular 
system monitoring, logging, and alerting to retain and analyze the security state of our corporate and production infrastructures.
We take steps to help ensure that our security measures are maintained by the third-party suppliers we use, including conducting annual security reviews and audits.
Competition
Our primary competition remains the legacy manual processes that SMBs have relied upon for decades. Other competitors range from large firms that predominantly focus on selling to enterprises; to providers of point solutions that focus exclusively on one of the many aspects of our business: document management, workflow management, accounts payable solutions, spend and expense management, card issuance, or accounts receivable solutions; to companies that offer industry-specific payment solutions.
We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a financial back-office solution that handles all of these core cash flow activities end-to-end. Our extensive investment in building a fully-integrated two-way sync with popular accounting software providers is well-regarded in the industry. With respect to the domestic payments that comprise the bulk of our business, we disburse and collect funds on behalf of our customers through our proprietary payments engine. We manage the associated financial risk of processing billions in total payment volume through our proprietary risk models and rules. 
We believe that the key competitive factors in our market include:
•Product features, quality, and functionality;
•Data asset size and ability to leverage artificial intelligence
•Ease of deployment;
•Ease of integration with leading accounting and banking technology infrastructures;
•Ability to automate processes;
•Cloud-based delivery architecture;
•Advanced security and control features;
•Regulatory compliance leadership, as evidenced by having been granted money transmitter licenses in all required U.S. jurisdictions and in Canada;
•Brand recognition; and
•Pricing and total cost of ownership.
We compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We expect the market for SMB back-office financial software and business-to-business payment solutions to continue to evolve and grow, as greater numbers of SMBs and larger businesses digitize their back offices. We believe that we are well-positioned to help them.
Research & Development
We invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, and we continually innovate to deliver value-added products and services. Our technology organization consists of engineering, product, and design teams. These teams are responsible for the design, development, and testing of our applications. We focus our efforts on developing new functionality and further enhancing the usability, reliability, and performance of existing applications.
Sales and Marketing
We distribute our platform through direct and indirect sales channels, both of which we leverage to reach our target customers in an efficient manner. Our direct sales are driven by a self-service process and an 
inside sales team. Our inside sales team augments our direct sales capabilities by targeting potential customers that have engaged with us on their own.
We also reach customers indirectly through our partnerships with accounting firms, financial institutions, and accounting software providers. While these partners sometimes require an initial integration investment, a go-to-market flywheel takes effect as our partners accelerate the delivery of our platform across their customer base with minimal incremental investment from us.
We focus our marketing efforts on generating leads to develop our sales pipeline, building brand and category awareness, enabling our go-to-market partners, and growing our business from within our existing customers. Our sales leads primarily come through word-of-mouth, our accounting firm partners, and website searches. We generate additional leads through digital marketing campaigns, referrals, in-product customer education, brand advertising, public relations, and social media. 
As part of our marketing efforts for our spend and expense management solution, we offer a card rewards program to drive card adoption, incent card usage, and drive card loyalty with spending businesses. Under the card rewards program, spending businesses can earn rewards based on transaction volume on the cards issued to them and can redeem those rewards mainly for cash, travel, and gift cards.
Customer Success
SMBs have unique needs and customer support contact expectations. With more than a decade of experience supporting our product, our customer success team has a deep understanding of their needs and has developed our support model accordingly. We recognize and understand patterns that our customers may not, because we see the aggregate – millions of transactions per month. We use what we learn to continuously improve the platform and the customer experience. We provide onboarding implementation support, as well as ongoing support and training. We periodically contact our customers to discuss their utilization of our platform, highlight additional features that may interest them, and identify any additional tools that may be needed.
Regulatory Environment
We operate in a rapidly-evolving regulatory environment. 
Payments and Banking Regulation
In order to conduct the payment services we offer we are required to be licensed to offer money transmission services in most U.S. states. We have procured and maintained money transmitter licenses in 50 U.S. jurisdictions and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a Money Services Business with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum capital requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and regulatory examinations by state and federal regulatory agencies.
We also hold a Foreign Money Services Business (FMSB) license in Canada that is administered by The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) and a Money Services Business License administered by Quebec's Autorité Des Marchés Financiers (Financial Markets Authority). Global Affairs Canada and Canada's Department of Public Safety administer Canadian sanctions programs and oversee our compliance with these regulations. 
We are contractually obligated to comply with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) federal banking regulations, as well as with Visa and MasterCard rules, as a card program manager for the card program management banks (CPMB) for our card product offerings. As a card program manager for the CPMBs, we have implemented compliance programs designed to ensure we are in compliance with applicable banking regulations and the Visa and MasterCard network rules. The CPMBs oversee our compliance program and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and rules. We are also subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC under the Bank Service Company Act in our capacity as program manager to the CPMBs for our card product offerings.
In addition, we are subject to FDIC oversight through the provision of FDIC insured business deposit accounts provided by a regulated bank in relation to certain Invoice2Go products. 
We maintain loan brokering and servicing licenses in a number of U.S. states in which Divvy's spend and expense management activity requires such licenses, and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. 
Our services utilize ACH transfers and require compliance with National Automated Clearing House Association rules.
In the future, we may decide to procure state lending licenses to support future product initiatives.
Anti-money Laundering, Counter-terrorist Financing, and Sanctions.
As a Money Services Business and a licensed money transmitter we are subject to U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations, including under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and similar U.S. state laws and regulations, and as a Foreign Money Service Business in Canada we are subject to various AML laws and regulations in Canada. In addition, we are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions, including, among others, the Canadian Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act and the Australian Sanctions Regime. We have implemented an AML and sanctions compliance program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Where we rely on partners for payment services, our partners have implemented AML and sanctions compliance programs. These compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing the risk associated with money laundering. Our United States (U.S.) compliance program includes the designation of a BSA compliance officer to oversee the program. These programs are also designed to manage terrorist financing risks and to comply with sanctions requirements to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by OFAC and relevant foreign authorities. 
Data Protection and Information Security
We receive, store, process, and use a wide variety of personal, business and financial information from prospective customers, customers, their vendors, and other users on our platform, as well as personal information about our employees and service providers. Our handling of this data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations. In the U.S. we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Graham Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulation governing the handling of personal data, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United Kingdom's GDPR, Australian and Canadian privacy laws and the privacy laws of other foreign jurisdictions. 
Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities regularly consider new legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain privacy and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux. 
Anti-corruption
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others, Australia's anti-bribery laws, the Canadian Criminal Code and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or 
otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
Additional Regulatory Developments
Various regulatory agencies in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which are applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant.
Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
Human Capital 
Our Culture and Employees
We are a people-centric company and actively develop and nurture a positive relationship with our employees. Our culture centers on our company values:
•Humble – No ego;
•Fun – Celebrate the moments;
•Authentic – We are who we are;
•Passionate – Love what you do; and
•Dedicated – To each other and the customer
Our values are core to who we are and who we hire, guide how we operate, define how we treat each other every day and ultimately make our teams strong cohesive units. We believe our culture enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent.
As of June 30, 2022, we had a total of 2,269 employees across three offices in the U.S.: San Jose, CA, Houston, TX, and Draper, UT; one office in Sydney, Australia; and others working remotely. We also employ individuals on a temporary basis and use the services of contractors as necessary. None of our employees are represented by a labor union in connection with their employment. 
We have recruiting and hiring practices that meet business hiring needs while maintaining a high bar for talent. We leverage data and analytics to align the recruiting function to business growth and revenue drivers. Our recruiting function was built to quickly scale with increased growth and expansion. Recruiting champions drive inclusive and equitable practices to engage, attract, and hire diverse talent. We provide two key talent management programs to develop our leaders and high potential employees to be their best. We also provide a rigorous program for new people managers. In addition, each year we provide a curriculum of study, linked to business needs, leveraging external learning platforms. The curriculum offers coursework in inclusivity, resiliency and decision-making. We foster a performance and continuous feedback culture including a bi-annual formal feedback cadence in addition to engaging our employees regularly to hear and take action on their sentiment. We have built a unique culture that resonates with employees, as evidenced by our highly-competitive, low attrition rates.
Employee recognition is core to who we are and we take great pride in recognizing those who embody our values, are top achievers, drive results and have longevity. Our recognition platform provides for peer-to-peer recognition and allows anyone in the company to recognize others for a job well done. On a quarterly basis we recognize four to five employees who embody our company values and we celebrate tenure and experience by acknowledging five and ten years of service to the company. Lastly, each year the Top Bill award is given to 
one individual that exhibits all of our values consistently, drives and delivers business results and is a master of their craft.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are building a diverse workforce, promoting equity in our practices and creating inclusive employee communities that encourage employee growth. Our mission is to build a company that fosters an equitable approach to hiring, career development, compensation, and career growth, where inclusivity, authenticity, and action matter. We also continuously cultivate a sense of inclusion and social responsibility. 
In addition to these internal efforts to support employees from diverse backgrounds, we focus outward as well. For example, we fund and support the African Diaspora Network's ABLE Program to develop and launch programs that prepare the next generation of Black entrepreneurs. Between our internal and external efforts, more than 200 executives and employees actively participate in events, employee resource groups, sponsorships and other activities in support of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
Total Rewards
We are committed to providing a fair and equitable compensation and benefits program that supports our diverse workforce. We provide competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain talent, including offering market-competitive base salary, bi-annual bonuses and sales commissions, and equity. We offer employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity refresh grants, and provide an employee stock purchase plan, to foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in our long-term success. We routinely run analyses to ensure compensation is fair, considering compensable factors that can impact pay, such as role, level, experience, location, and performance. Our full-time employees are eligible to receive, subject to the satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements, our comprehensive benefits package, including our medical, dental and vision insurance, and life and income protection plans. In addition, we provide uncapped time off, as well as maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. In offering these benefit plans, our intent is to provide a level of benefits that are comparable to those offered by similar companies. 
Employee Wellness/COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted several programs and precautionary measures in support of employee well-being and to protect the health and safety of our workforce, our customers and the communities in which we participate. For example, in March 2020, we closed our corporate headquarters in California and our office in Texas, implemented full-time work from home for our entire workforce and eliminated non-essential travel. We regularly surveyed our team members through our employee survey tool to best understand their needs. Based on survey results, we established no-meetings Wednesday afternoons, instituted a remote work program, provided several wellness days, gave employees a home office stipend, provided additional mental health resources, and options for social connections and vaccination support. We continue to monitor federal, state and local regulatory pronouncements and COVID-19 infection statistics and have begun to reopen our offices in phases, depending on location. In connection with our office re-openings we have instituted numerous social distancing measures to ensure the safety of our employees. As of June 30, 2022, a significant number of our employees continued to work in a remote capacity while we find ways to return to the office safely and with the right flexibility.
ESG Management
We are committed to creating a more inclusive workplace while adhering to our core values. Our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) management prioritizes social innovation, employees, culture and responsible business practices, and our business model, which helps SMBs automate financial operations and reduce paper consumption, naturally aligns to principles of environmental sustainability. We believe that our approach to conducting business responsibly helps us create value for all of our stakeholders. We take this commitment seriously and endeavor to provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through both our internal and external communications.
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual measures.
As of June 30, 2022, in the U.S., we had nineteen issued patents that expire between 2028 and 2040, and six pending patent applications along with two pending international patent applications. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of June 30, 2022, in the U.S. we had three trademark registrations covering the “Bill.com” logo and two trademark registrations related to the “Divvy” name, along with three additional trademark registrations filed by Divvy. We also own a U.S. trademark registration for the name Invoice2Go and the Invoice2Go logo, along with a registration in Canada for the logo, and an application to register the mark GETGO, also in Canada. We own one registration in Australia for the Invoice2Go logo along with an application to register GETGO. In addition, we own three International Registrations for the marks GETGO, Invoice2Go and the Invoice2Go logo, with protection extended to multiple countries, primarily in Europe. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We also own several domain names, including www.bill.com, www.getdivvy.com and www.invoice2go.com. 
We rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
From time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed.
 For additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
