ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 OncoMed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutics that address the fundamental biology driving cancer’s growth, resistance, recurrence and metastasis. We have two internally discovered anti-cancer therapeutic candidates currently in active clinical development. The following summarizes the status of our therapeutic candidates, each of which will be described and discussed in further detail below under “Our Therapeutic Candidates.”
  
• | Navicixizumab (Anti-DLL4/VEGF Bispecific, OMP-305B83). Navicixizumab is our bispecific monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits both Delta-like ligand 4, or DLL4, and vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. We have completed both a Phase Ia single-agent clinical trial of navicixizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and a Phase Ib clinical trial of navicixizumab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in patients with second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We are currently conducting a Phase Ib clinical trial to assess navicixizumab in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen of paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Enrollment in the Phase Ib clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer has recently been completed. We have worldwide rights to the navicixizumab program.

• | Etigilimab (Anti-TIGIT, OMP-313M32). T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains, or TIGIT, is an inhibitory receptor that is thought to potentially stop T-cells from attacking certain tumor cells. We are currently conducting a Phase Ia/b clinical trial of etigilimab. Etigilimab was tested as a single agent in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in the now-complete Phase Ia portion of the Phase Ia/b trial, and in combination with nivolumab (anti-PD1) in the ongoing Phase Ib portion of the clinical trial. Enrollment in the Phase Ia/b clinical trial has been completed. The etigilimab program is part of our collaboration with Celgene, which is discussed below under “Key Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Alliance with Celgene.” Celgene has the option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize etigilimab. If Celgene exercises its option on etigilimab, we would be eligible for a $35.0 million opt-in payment, potential future milestones and royalties, and Celgene would then lead and fully fund further development and commercialization of etigilimab.

Merger, to refrain from taking certain actions specified in the Merger Agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to consummate the Merger. 
 Neither OncoMed nor Mereo is permitted to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate, any alternative transaction proposals from third parties or to engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding any alternative transaction proposals. Notwithstanding this limitation, prior to OncoMed’s stockholders or Mereo’s shareholders, as applicable, approving the transaction, each party may under certain circumstances provide information to and participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties with respect to an alternative transaction proposal that its board of directors has determined in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal. Each party’s board of directors may change its recommendation to its stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, (subject to the other party’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement following such change in recommendation) in response to a superior proposal if the board of directors determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law. 
 The Merger Agreement provides for certain termination rights for each of OncoMed and Mereo. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $1,721,193, and in some circumstances reimburse the other party’s expenses up to a maximum of $750,000, in each case, subject to any adjustment for value added tax. 
 At the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Mereo is expected to be expanded to consist of ten members to accommodate the appointment of current OncoMed directors Michael Wyzga and Dr. Deepa Pakianathan as independent non-executive directors. The existing Mereo directors are expected continue to serve in their current positions. 
 
Support Agreements 
 Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, certain of our officers and directors who are stockholders of OncoMed, in their respective capacities as stockholders of OncoMed (together with certain of their respective affiliates), entered into support agreements with Mereo (the “OncoMed Support Agreements”), pursuant to which such individuals have agreed, among other things, to (i) vote their respective shares of OncoMed Common Stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, against any alternative proposal and against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to frustrate the purposes, prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) grant an irrevocable proxy to Mereo to vote such individual’s shares in the manner contemplated in clause (i) of this paragraph. The persons signing the OncoMed Support Agreements currently beneficially own an aggregate of 11% of the outstanding OncoMed Common Stock. 
 Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Mereo holding Mereo stock or options, in their respective capacities as shareholders of Mereo (together with certain of their respective affiliates, collectively, the “Mereo D&Os”), Novartis Pharma AG and certain funds under the management of Invesco Asset Management Limited have entered into support agreements with the OncoMed (the “Mereo Support Agreements”), pursuant to which such individuals and entities have agreed, among other things, to (i) vote their respective shares of Mereo Ordinary Shares in favor of the approval of the issuance of Mereo Depositary Shares and the allotment and issuance of the Mereo Ordinary Shares underlying the Mereo Depositary Shares to be issued in the Merger and the grant of the CVRs pursuant to the Merger Agreement, against any alternative proposal and against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to frustrate the purposes, prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) solely with respect to the Mereo D&Os and the Mereo Support Agreement entered into by Novartis Pharma AG, execute any forms of an irrevocable proxy required to appoint OncoMed as such individual’s proxy to vote such individual’s shares in the manner contemplated in (i) of this paragraph.  The individuals and entities signing the Mereo Support Agreements currently hold legal title to an aggregate of approximately 52% of the outstanding Mereo Ordinary Shares. 
 
Contingent Value Rights Agreement 
 6


At the Effective Time, Mereo and Computershare Inc., as rights agent, will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”). Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, OncoMed’s stockholders will receive one CVR for each outstanding share of OncoMed Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each CVR will represent the right to receive payments related to OncoMed’s etigilimab (anti-TIGIT, OMP-313M32) and navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF, OMP-305B83) therapeutic candidates, whereby CVR holders will be entitled to receive (i) upon the exercise by Celgene Corporation or certain affiliates thereof (together, “Celgene”) of the exclusive option granted by OncoMed to Celgene in relation to etigilimab pursuant to OncoMed’s collaboration agreement with Celgene, which is discussed below under “Key Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Alliance with Celgene” (the “Option Exercise”), and actual receipt by OncoMed of the cash payment payable by Celgene pursuant to such Option Exercise, a number of Mereo Depositary Shares equal to (x) the cash payment received by Mereo upon the Option Exercise, net of any tax and other reasonable expenses, divided by (y) the volume-weighted average price per Mereo Depositary Share for the ten (10) trading day period immediately following the date of the announcement by Mereo of such cash payment, and (ii) certain cash payments related to navicixizumab if, within 18 months of the closing of the Merger, Mereo or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with one or more third parties regarding such products and, within five years of the closing of the Merger, Mereo or any of its subsidiaries receives certain eligible cash milestone payments. In order to be eligible for the CVR, an OncoMed stockholder must be a holder of record at the close of business on the last business day immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
 The CVR will not be transferable, except in limited circumstances, and will not be registered with the SEC. The Mereo Depositary Shares issuable pursuant to the CVR Agreement will be registered with the SEC under the Registration Statement on Form F-4 referred to in “Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger” above. 
 Strategy
 We are focused on developing novel therapeutic candidates directed to fundamental biologic pathways and targets thought to drive cancer’s growth, resistance, recurrence and metastasis. The inability of the immune system to shut down tumor growth, through a series of tumor-associated resistance mechanisms, enables the growth and recurrence of cancers. We have discovered and advanced therapeutic candidates specifically targeting key pathways that drive the growth of cancer, including cancer stem cells, or CSCs, as well as immuno-oncology therapeutic candidates that aim to bolster immune system recognition of cancer cells and/or suppress immune system evasion mechanisms. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Advance our current therapeutic candidates in clinical trials to determine their utility as treatments for cancer. Our Phase I clinical trials with navicixizumab and etigilimab are designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile, identify a therapeutic index, and look for initial indications of efficacy and biomarker effects of our drugs alone or as part of a combination regimen.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborate with our partner Celgene to advance our partnered program forward in clinical development. We are working closely with our partner to advance our partnered program, etigilimab, in development. Under our collaboration, Celgene has an option during a certain time period through the end of a specified Phase I trial to obtain an exclusive license to etigilimab. In the event that this option is not exercised at the end of the relevant option period, we will retain worldwide rights to the etigilimab program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use collaborations with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to provide funding, create value and leverage partners’ expertise to bring medicines to patients. To facilitate the capital-efficient development and commercialization of our unpartnered programs such as navicixizumab, we routinely engage in partnering discussions with a range of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our therapeutic candidate navicixizumab targets DLL4 on the Notch pathway in addition to VEGF. Through clinical and preclinical studies, we observed that navicixizumab has a multi-pronged mechanism of action, including anti-CSC, anti-angiogenesis and immuno-oncology properties. We have conducted preclinical studies of anti-DLL4 plus anti-VEGF in combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors and observed synergistic anti-tumor responses and heightened immune cell memory responses that are greater than can be achieved with any of the agents when used alone. 
 7


Our immuno-oncology therapeutic candidate, etigilimab, targets TIGIT. TIGIT blocks T-cells from attacking tumor cells, and shares some properties with the inhibitory protein PD-1.  Our anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidate is intended to activate the immune system through multiple mechanisms and enable substantial anti-tumor activity.
 Our Therapeutic Candidates
 Navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83)
 We utilized our proprietary bispecific antibody technology to generate a monoclonal antibody, navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), that targets both DLL4 and VEGF. VEGF is the target for bevacizumab (Avastin®), which is currently approved and used to treat a number of solid tumors including colorectal, NSCLC, breast, renal cell, brain, cervical, and ovarian cancers and had worldwide revenues of $7.4 billion in 2015. DLL4 is a ligand which is responsible in part for tumor growth and angiogenesis. Navicixizumab is designed to inhibit the function of both DLL4 and VEGF and thereby has the potential to induce anti-tumor activity while mitigating certain toxicities.  Preclinical data of dual DLL4 and VEGF inhibition in xenograft tumor models have demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to either anti-DLL4 or anti-VEGF alone and anti-tumor activity was observed in multiple tumor types including colon, ovarian, breast and pancreatic. We have also observed that navicixizumab induced a down-regulation of vasculature-related genes and decreased vasculature density.  An improved cardiac safety profile was also observed in cynomolgus monkeys compared to anti-DLL4 alone.
 In 2018, together with our clinical collaborators, we published the results of the Phase Ia clinical trial of single-agent navicixizumab (Jimeno, A., Moore, K.N., Gordon, M. et al. Invest New Drugs (2018)).  The most commonly enrolled tumor types in the trial were ovarian (12), colorectal (11) and cancers of the breast, pancreas, uterus and endometrium (four patients of each). Four patients (three ovarian cancer patients and one uterine carcinosarcoma patient) had a partial response, and 17 patients had stable disease. There were 19 patients that had a reduction in the size of their target lesions, including seven patients with ovarian cancer. Six of these seven ovarian cancer patients had received prior bevacizumab. Four patients remained on study for >300 days and two of these patients were on study for >500 days. The most common drug related adverse events of any grade were hypertension (58%), headache (29%), fatigue (26%), and pulmonary hypertension (18%). Infusion reactions associated with anti-drug antibodies impacting drug exposure occurred in 11% of patients.
 A Phase 1b trial of navcixizumab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in patients with second-line metastatic colorectal cancer has been completed. We are currently conducting a Phase Ib clinical trial to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of navicixizumab in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy paclitaxel in ovarian cancer. The patients enrolled in the Phase Ib multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion trial in ovarian cancer are patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers) who have previously received bevacizumab and/or have failed greater than two prior therapies. Enrollment in the Phase Ib clinical trial in ovarian cancer has been completed.
 We presented interim results through August 13, 2018 from the ongoing Phase 1b trial investigating navicixizumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in October 2018 at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting (“ESMO 2018”). The patients had received a median of four prior therapies, all of whom had received prior paclitaxel and 69% had received prior bevacizumab. Twenty-two of the 26 patients (85%) treated with the novel regimen experienced clinical benefit. Notably, 11 of the 26 patients (42%) achieved a partial response.  The RECIST response rate in the bevacizumab naïve and bevacizumab pretreated patients was 57% and 33%, respectively.  The overall median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% CI:  3.5-8.0 months). The median PFS for the subset of bevacizumab pretreated patients was 3.7 months.   Historical response rates for patients with heavily pretreated platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with chemotherapy are typically 15% or less.  
 Interim cancer antigen 125, or CA-125, data from the Phase Ib trial was also presented at ESMO 2018.  CA-125 is a widely utilized tumor marker for ovarian cancer that is used along with radiographic assessments to determine the efficacy outcome to treatment. Of the 23 patients evaluable for a Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
 8


(GCIG) CA-125 response outcome, 14 (61%) had a response. Specifically, the GCIG CA-125 response rates in the bevacizumab naïve and bevacizumab pretreated patients were 100% and 47%, respectively.
 The interim Phase Ib data presented at ESMO 2018 indicated that the most common related adverse events of any grade related to navicixizumab were hypertension (53%), fatigue (32%), diarrhea (24%) and headache (18%). Other related rare adverse events of special interest were one Grade 2 pulmonary hypertension, one Grade 1 related heart failure, one Grade 4 related gastrointestinal perforation and one Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Three patients (12%) experienced infusion reactions that were associated with anti-drug antibodies which impacted drug exposure.
 Navicixizumab was previously a part of our strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, which is discussed below under “Key Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Alliance with Celgene.” In September 2018, Celgene informed us of its decision not to exercise its option to license navicixizumab due to strategic product portfolio considerations. Celgene terminated the collaboration agreement with respect to navicixizumab, effective January 23, 2019.  As a result, we have worldwide rights to the navicixizumab program.
 Etigilimab (Anti-TIGIT; OMP-313M32)
 TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) is an inhibitory receptor similar to the inhibitory protein PD-1, and via interactions with its ligands may block T-cells from attacking tumor cells.  Our anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidate, etigilimab (OMP-313M32), is intended to activate the immune system, through multiple mechanisms, and enable anti-tumor activity.  Etigilimab recently completed the single-agent Phase Ia portion of a Phase Ia/b clinical trial, which enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and is currently in the Phase Ib portion of the clinical trial, which combines etigilimab with anti-PD1 (nivolumab).  Enrollment in the Phase Ia/b clinical trial has been completed.
 We presented initial interim results through October 3, 2018 from the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the Phase 1a/b trial of etigilimab in November 2018 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting.  The interim results that were presented included data from 18 patients with a variety of late stage metastatic cancers including colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, among others, who were treated with etigilimab at doses ranging from 0.3 to 20 mg/kg every other week. There were no dose-limiting toxicities through the 20 mg/kg every other week dose.  In this "all comers" difficult-to-treat patient population, stable disease was observed in 7 (38.9%) patients with prolonged disease control seen in some patients with the longest durations of stable disease being 205 and 225 days.  Of the remaining 11 patients in the study, ten patients had progressive disease, and one patient did not meet criteria to be evaluated for efficacy. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were rash (27.8%), fatigue (16.7%), nausea (16.7%), pruritus (16.7%), and cough (11.1%). Immune-related adverse events, signaling immune activation included rash (27.8%), pruritus (16.7%), autoimmune hepatitis (5.6%) and stomatitis (5.6%). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs included rash (16.7%), abdominal pain, embolism, hypertension, and pulmonary embolism (11.1% each).  A biomarker analysis was also presented at the meeting which demonstrated a significant reduction of peripheral T regulatory cells (Tregs), most significant at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg, and signals of immune activation.  These interim results are consistent with preclinical studies with a surrogate anti-TIGIT antibody and suggest select immune cell depletion and activation of T cell signaling in patients treated with the drug.
 In preclinical studies with anti-TIGIT antibodies, we have observed immune activation and robust anti-tumor activity — both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer immunotherapeutics including anti-PD1.  At the 2017 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) meeting, we presented preclinical data demonstrating the capacity of an anti-TIGIT antibody to induce long-term immune memory and durable anti-tumor response. Also, at the 2018 AACR meeting we presented data that showed that anti-TIGIT treatment reduced the abundance of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) within tumors in animal models, and mechanistic studies demonstrated an important contribution of effector function for anti-tumor efficacy in animal models. 
 Etigilimab is part of our collaboration with Celgene, and Celgene has an option to obtain an exclusive license to etigilimab. If Celgene exercises its option to obtain a license to etigilimab, Celgene would then lead and fully fund further development and commercialization, and we would be entitled to receive a $35.0 million opt-in payment, along with potential future milestones and royalties. Additional details related to our collaboration with Celgene are described below under “Key Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Alliance with Celgene.”

Wnt Pathway Small Molecule Inhibitors
 As part of our Bayer collaboration, we and Bayer jointly initiated discovery efforts to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Wnt pathway. We developed assay technologies and transferred those to Bayer. Bayer utilized its extensive medicinal chemistry assets and capabilities to discover small molecule drug candidates that modulate Wnt signaling, and we employed our internal lead validation technologies to evaluate candidate compounds as a basis for advancing them into development. OncoMed participates in a Joint Steering Committee, but is currently conducting no other activities related to the Wnt pathway small molecule program.
Programs Discontinued in 2018-2019
 During the course of 2018 and early 2019, we decided to discontinue development of certain therapeutic product candidates. The discontinued programs are as follows:
  
• | GITRL-Fc (OMP-336B11). Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein, or GITR, and its ligand, GITRL, are members of the tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, family of receptors and ligands. TNF ligands are trimeric proteins and their binding to receptors leads to activation of intracellular signaling. Our GITR ligand therapeutic candidate, GITRL-Fc, is engineered using a novel single-gene, linkerless trimer technology that is designed to enable effective activation of GITR. Activation of GITR enhances T-cell modulated immune responses, which may be a potential target for stimulating immune system activity against tumor cells. GITRL-Fc is currently in a Phase Ia clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, although enrollment in the clinical trial has ended and OncoMed does not plan to advance GITRL-Fc beyond Phase Ia. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rosmantuzumab (anti-RSPO3, OMP-131R10). Rosmantuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the RSPO-LGR cancer stem cell, or CSC, pathway, and it was a part of our strategic collaboration with Celgene, which is discussed below under “Key Collaboration and License Agreements—Strategic Alliance with Celgene.” Rosmantuzumab was recently studied in a Phase Ia/b clinical trial, but the trial failed to provide compelling evidence of clinical benefit. In October 2018, Celgene notified us of its decision not to exercise its option to license rosmantuzumab and terminated our collaboration agreement with respect to rosmantuzumab, effective February 12, 2019. We retain worldwide rights to the rosmantuzumab program.

Key Collaboration and License Agreements 
 In the normal course of our business, we enter into a variety of collaboration, partnership and license arrangements with third parties, certain of which are discussed below.
Strategic Alliance with Celgene
 In December 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Celgene pursuant to which we and Celgene were to collaborate on research and development programs directed to the discovery and development of novel biologic therapeutics, and, if Celgene exercised its option to do so, the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics. 
 Our etigilimab program is the last remaining biologic therapeutic program that is currently active under our collaboration agreement with Celgene.  Celgene has an option to obtain an exclusive license to develop further and commercialize biologic therapeutics in the etigilimab program, which may be exercised during time periods specified in the collaboration agreement through the earlier of completion of a certain clinical trial or the twelfth anniversary of the date of the collaboration agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we lead the development of etigilimab prior to Celgene’s exercise of its option for the etigilimab program. We are responsible for funding all research and development activities for therapeutics in the etigilimab program prior to Celgene’s exercise of the option for the program. Upon option exercise by Celgene, we will be required to enter into an agreed form of a license agreement with Celgene, pursuant to which Celgene retains all rights to develop further and commercialize biologic therapeutic products in the etigilimab program on a worldwide basis, with certain support for development from us.  
 10


We are eligible to receive a $35.0 million opt-in payment upon Celgene’s exercise of the option for the etigilimab program. The collaboration also includes milestone payments for achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, paid on a per-product and per-program basis. The option exercise payments and payments for achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the agreement may total up to $440.0 million, for products in the etigilimab program, including the $35.0 million opt-in payment.  We previously received a $2.5 million milestone payment for the etigilimab program.  Accordingly, the future potential milestone payments for products in the etigilimab program under the collaboration total up to $437.5 million, including the $35.0 million opt-in payment. For the etigilimab program, if the option is exercised and the program is successfully commercialized by Celgene, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties equal to a percentage of net product sales worldwide in the high-single digits to the mid-teens. We are not eligible to receive any further research or development milestone payments for etigilimab prior to Celgene’s decision regarding option exercise with respect to etigilimab.
 Our collaboration agreement with Celgene will terminate upon the expiration of all of Celgene’s payment obligations under the license agreement entered into with respect to the etigilimab program following Celgene’s exercise of an option for such program, or if Celgene’s option on the etigilimab program expires without Celgene exercising its option. The collaboration agreement may be terminated by either party for the insolvency of, or an uncured material breach of the collaboration agreement by, the other party. In addition, Celgene may terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety or with respect to the etigilimab program, for any reason, upon 120 days’ prior written notice to us and upon 60 days’ prior written notice in the event that Celgene reasonably believes that such termination is necessary in order to comply with any antitrust laws. We may also terminate the collaboration agreement with respect to the etigilimab program in the event that Celgene challenges the licensed patents with respect to such program.
 If Celgene does not exercise its option with respect to the etigilimab program before the option for that program expires, we will retain worldwide rights to such program. In addition, under certain termination circumstances, we would also have worldwide rights to the etigilimab program.
 Our collaboration agreement with Celgene previously included our demcizumab, navicixizumab, and rosmantuzumab biologic therapeutic programs.  Celgene, however, terminated the collaboration agreement with respect to both demcizumab and navicixizumab, effective January 23, 2019, and terminated the collaboration agreement with respect to rosmantuzumab, effective February 12, 2019.  Prior to such terminations, Celgene had options to obtain an exclusive license to develop further and commercialize biologic therapeutics in these programs under the agreement.  As a result of these terminations, we now have worldwide rights to each of these programs, including navicixizumab.  Under certain circumstances, we may owe Celgene single-digit percentage royalties on therapeutic products in these programs if we elect to continue to commercialize them and they are successfully commercialized, subject to a cap.
 Celgene previously had the right to designate up to two additional biologic therapeutic programs targeting the RSPO-LGR signaling pathway or an undisclosed pathway for inclusion in the collaboration, but this right expired on the fourth anniversary of the date of the collaboration agreement. Celgene also had an additional option, which expired unexercised on the fourth anniversary of the date of the collaboration agreement, that would have permitted Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule therapeutics directed to targets in an undisclosed pathway under the collaboration.
 In December 2013, we sold 1,470,588 shares of our common stock to Celgene at a price of $15.13 per share, which resulted in gross proceeds to us of $22.2 million. We agreed with Celgene that, after we have qualified for the use of Form S-3 and upon the written request of Celgene, we would prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 for purposes of registering the resale of the shares specified in Celgene’s written request. We also agreed, among other things, to indemnify Celgene under the registration statement from certain liabilities and to pay all fees and expenses (excluding any legal fees of the selling holder(s) above $10,000 per registration statement and any underwriting discounts and selling commissions) incident to our obligations to register the resale of Celgene’s shares of our common stock.

Strategic Alliance with Bayer
 In June 2010, we entered into a strategic alliance with Bayer to discover, develop and commercialize novel anti-CSC biologic and small molecule therapeutics targeting the Wnt signaling pathway. Under this collaboration, Bayer could have exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize biologic therapeutics in one or more defined biologic therapeutic classes. However, effective June 16, 2017, Bayer terminated all biologic therapeutic programs under this collaboration. Under this collaboration, we and Bayer also agreed to jointly conduct research to discover potential new small molecule therapeutics targeting the Wnt pathway, and we granted Bayer a non-exclusive license to our Wnt pathway assay technology for the research and development of such small molecule therapeutics. Bayer may, within a specified time period, elect to advance such small molecule therapeutics into development, and obtain an exclusive license to commercialize such therapeutics. Bayer leads discovery, development and commercialization of such small molecule therapeutics. Bayer is obligated to make payments to us upon achievement of research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones for small molecule therapeutics that could total up to $112.0 million per program, in addition to single-digit percentage royalties on net product sales. 
 Our agreement with Bayer includes several committees, including a Joint Steering Committee and a Joint Development Sub-Committee, among others, that meet periodically to discuss our activities in the collaboration. Decisions are generally made jointly through these committees, however Bayer generally has final decision-making authority with respect to development of small molecule projects.
 Our agreement with Bayer and their payment obligations thereunder will expire on a product by product and country by country basis on the last to occur of (i) the expiry of certain patent rights covering the product in such country, (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period in such country, or (iii) ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country. Our agreement will also expire if Bayer does not elect to advance the small molecule therapeutics program into development within the time period specified in the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that the breaching party fails to cure. Bayer may terminate the agreement for any reason or no reason upon prior notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement if Bayer challenges the licensed patents.
 Strategic Alliance with GSK
 On December 7, 2007, the Company entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement with GSK. The agreement was formed to discover, develop and market novel antibody therapeutics to target CSCs. The agreement gave GSK the option to obtain an exclusive license for certain product candidates targeting the Notch signaling pathway. Effective October 28, 2017, GSK terminated the agreement in its entirety.
 
The University of Michigan 
 In January 2001, Cancer Stem Cell Genomics, Inc. entered into a license agreement with the Regents of the University of Michigan, or the University of Michigan. In 2004, Cancer Stem Cell Genomics, Inc. merged with and into us, and we assumed this license agreement with the University of Michigan. Under the agreement and in exchange for certain additional consideration, the University of Michigan has granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under certain patent rights, and a nonexclusive, worldwide license under certain technologies, to make, have made, import, use, market, offer for sale or sell products and to practice processes for any use, including human therapeutic or diagnostic use, that are covered by the licensed patents. Technologies covered by the licensed patents include certain enriched CSC compositions, CSC markers, diagnostic methods, as well as certain therapeutic methods using certain anti-CSC antibodies. Additional details regarding certain patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement are described in more detail below under “Intellectual Property.” The University of Michigan reserved certain rights to the licensed patents for noncommercial research and education purposes.
 12


We are required to pay to the University of Michigan an annual license maintenance fee and reimburse the University of Michigan for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, both of which are credited towards future royalty payments. We are also required to pay to the University of Michigan percentage royalties in the low single digits based on net sales by us or our sublicensees of products or processes covered by the licensed patents until expiry of the patents. With respect to one family of licensed patent applications that does not relate to any of our lead therapeutic programs, we are also required to pay a tiered, single-digit percentage of any sublicense revenues, including any upfront or milestone payments, received from any sublicensees under such family of patents. Once the University of Michigan has received $10.0 million in royalties, we may, at our option, convert the license to a fully paid-up license provided we transfer to the University of Michigan shares of our non-voting capital stock equal to 0.25% of the fully diluted number of shares outstanding at the time of our election. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products and processes within certain time periods.
 If not terminated earlier, this agreement terminates upon the expiration of all patent rights licensed under this agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that the breaching party fails to cure. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon expiration of a defined notice period.
 Lonza Sales AG
 In August 2012, we entered into a multi-product license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza. This agreement relates to the process development and manufacturing of our biologics portfolio with Lonza. Under the multi-product license agreement, we receive licenses to utilize Lonza’s glutamine synthetase gene expression system and related technologies for commercial production of our product candidates. Under this license agreement, we paid an upfront payment of $488,000 and are obligated to pay Lonza payments up to £200,000 (approximately $254,000) per licensed product on achievement of specified milestones, and royalties up to the very low single digits on sales of licensed products. The multi-product license agreement shall remain in force on a product by product and country by country basis until expiration of our obligation to make payments to Lonza with respect to such product in such country. The agreement can otherwise be terminated by us for any reason or no reason upon advance written notice to Lonza, or by either us or Lonza upon the other party’s material breach of the agreement, or if the other party ceases to carry on business. Lonza may also terminate the licenses granted under the agreement if we challenge any of the Lonza patent rights.
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, antibody technologies, biomarkers, screening technologies and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 As a normal course of business, we pursue both composition-of-matter patents and method-of-use patents for our product candidates. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel biological discoveries, including new targets and applications, as well as to biomarkers and novel antibody technologies. 
 In addition to the patents and patent applications owned solely by us, our patent portfolio also includes patents and patent applications licensed from the University of Michigan. As of December 31, 2018, we had an exclusive, worldwide license from the University of Michigan to over 40 issued U.S. and foreign patents. A few of the patents in the portfolio licensed from the University of Michigan are jointly owned by us.
 The patent portfolios for navicixizumab and etigilimab as of December 31, 2018, are summarized below.
  
• | Navicixizumab (Anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83). Our navicixizumab portfolio includes a core patent family that is solely owned by us and covers both the composition of matter and methods of use of navicixizumab. As of December 31, 2018, this family includes four issued U.S. patents and two 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
pending U.S. patent applications, as well as corresponding patents or patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions. Patents that have issued or will issue in this core family are generally expected to expire in 2032.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our portfolio also includes several other issued U.S. and foreign patents that relate to navicixizumab, certain methods of its use, and/or related biomarkers, which expire between 2021 and 2033.  An issued U.S. patent exclusively licensed by us from the University of Michigan that broadly covers the use of anti-DLL4 antibodies for the treatment of cancer expires in 2022. 
 Additional U.S. and foreign patent applications solely owned by us that relate to navicixizumab, certain methods of its use, and/or related biomarkers are also pending and, to the extent they issue, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2036.
  
• | Etigilimab (Anti-TIGIT, OMP-313M32). A core patent family in our etigilimab portfolio is solely owned by us and covers both the composition of matter and methods of use of etigilimab. This family includes an issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent, which expires in 2037, pending patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, and a foreign patent. To the extent that patent applications in this core patent family issue as patents, they are generally expected to expire in 2036. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Also included in our etigilimab portfolio is a PCT application that relates to certain uses of our etigilimab therapeutic candidate.  To the extent that this application is used to establish U.S. and/or foreign patent applications that issue as patents, the patents are generally expected to expire in 2037.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, products approved as a biological product under a biologics license application, or BLA, in the United States may qualify for a 12-year period of non-patent exclusivity. See “Government Regulation—Biologics License Applications” below for additional information on such exclusivity. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors, including those involved in the filing of a BLA.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. The issued patents that we own or license, or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. We may also need to participate in legal proceedings before courts in the U.S. or foreign countries, inter partes or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO, or opposition proceedings before the EPO regarding patents in our portfolio. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 Our commercial success, like the commercial success of other companies in our industry, will depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. We or our collaborators may not have rights under some patents that may 
 14


cover the composition of matter, manufacture or use of product candidates that we seek to develop and commercialize, drug targets to which our product candidates bind, or technologies that we use in our research and development activities. As a result, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates may depend on our ability to obtain licenses or other rights under such patents. The third parties who own or control such patents may be unwilling to grant those licenses or other rights to us or our collaborators under terms that are commercially viable or at all. We may become involved in legal proceedings before courts in the U.S. or foreign countries or other proceedings, such as opposition proceedings before the EPO or inter partes review, post-grant review, or interference proceedings before the USPTO, challenging the validity or enforceability of such patents owned by third parties, but such proceedings may not be resolved in our favor. Third parties who own or control such patents could bring claims based on patent infringement against us or our collaborators and seek monetary damages and to enjoin further clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product candidates or products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If a third party commences a patent infringement action against us, or our collaborators, it could consume significant financial and management resources, regardless of the merit of the claims or the outcome of the litigation. If we do not settle and are not successful in defending against any such patent infringement action, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we, or our collaborators, could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is claimed by the third party’s patent. For more information related to third party rights, see "Risk Factors – Risks related to our Intellectual Property".
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
 Competition
 We compete in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address solid tumor cancers and hematologic cancers. We face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, legal, research and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
 It is possible that our competitors will develop and market drugs or other treatments that are less expensive and more effective than our product candidates, or that will render our product candidates obsolete. It is also possible that our competitors will commercialize competing drugs or treatments before we or our current or future partners can launch any products developed from our product candidates. If approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies worldwide, our product candidates would compete against existing cancer treatments such as Avastin®, Erbitux®, Yervoy™, Keytruda®, Opdivo®, chemotherapies, and potentially against other novel drug candidates or treatments that are currently in development. There have been several additional monoclonal antibodies in development for cancer, such as Abbvie’s ABT-165, an anti-DLL4/VEGF dual variable domain immunoglobulin, and ABL Bio’s ABL001, an anti-DLL4/VEGF antibody, both of which are reportedly being studied in clinical trials. In the immuno-oncology field, there are several approved therapeutic agents against other immuno-oncology targets and there are several companies reportedly advancing antibody programs modulating TIGIT in early stage research and development, including Genentech (Roche), Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb or BMS, and Arcus Biosciences. 
 Established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are known to be involved in oncology research and currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include Amgen, AbbVie, Astellas, AstraZeneca, 
 15


Bayer, BMS, Celgene, Genentech (Roche), GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Sanofi, Teva and others. There are also biotechnology companies of various sizes that are developing therapies against immuno-oncology targets, and others also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Manufacturing
 Our current product candidates are manufactured using specialized biopharmaceutical process techniques. We generally conduct mammalian cell line development and process development in house, and then transfer the production cell line and process to our contract manufacturers for bulk protein production. Our contract manufacturers to date have included Lonza and Bayer. If Celgene exercises its option for the further development of the etigilimab program under its collaboration agreement, it would assume manufacturing responsibility for the applicable product candidates. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce other product candidates in accordance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations for use in our clinical trials. However, we currently rely on a single source supplier for our requirements of the bulk drug substance of each of our product candidates. The manufacture of drug and biologic products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of recordkeeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We expect to rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of our compounds other than those product candidates for which Celgene has exercised its option.
 We purchase quantities of our product candidates from our contract manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we place from time to time. If we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of product candidates or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay our ongoing clinical trials and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming. We may consider adding secondary sources for manufacturing in the future.
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of our product candidates. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of our product candidates.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States, and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the FDA deems it necessary. We currently conduct trials only in the United States. However, we have previously conducted trials in many countries and regions including the United States, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, and we may include clinical trial centers in these and other territories in any other clinical trials that we may initiate for our therapeutic candidates in the future, including later-stage clinical development programs for our therapeutic candidates that we develop independently, prior to submitting a BLA to the FDA, or comparable applications to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other relevant regulatory agencies in global markets. We have designed our clinical trials to comply with FDA regulatory requirements for the use of foreign clinical data in support of a BLA, and we intend to utilize data from our current clinical trials in support of our future U.S. and worldwide development and potential commercialization.
 17


Clinical Trials
 For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to: evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study; evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III clinical trials are commonly definitive efficacy studies of the experimental medication. Phase III trials are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Biologics License Applications
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a biologic is safe and effective for its intended use.
 Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to 90% of standard original BLA submissions within ten months of the filing date, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase III clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the biologic reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such biologic or require a recall of any biologic already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 18


A sponsor may also seek approval of its product candidates under programs designed to accelerate FDA review and approval of BLAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “fast track” product. Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments, under the FDA’s accelerated approval program. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint. 
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies.” A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation provides all of the features of fast track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. Product candidates may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six month timeframe from the date a complete BLA is accepted for filing, if a sponsor shows that its product candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation for our product candidates. We cannot predict whether any of our product candidates will obtain a fast track and/or accelerated approval designation, or the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track designation on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our proposed biologics.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the biologic unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory.
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. 
 We believe that any of our products approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of non-patent exclusivity currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. Specifically, the BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar 
 19


biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable,” based on their similarity to existing brand products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. There is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this 12-year exclusivity period or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes that operate to limit the scope or length of exclusivity afforded by the BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 20


If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 In the United States, the FFDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FFDCA. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and approval of a premarket, or PMA approval.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device or predicate devices and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device or predicate devices with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device or predicate devices, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. 
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe 
 21


and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
 Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act:

• | increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expands the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expands access to commercial health insurance coverage through new state-based health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts, which, through subsequent legislative amendments, were increased to 70%, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, will impact the law. As a result, there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to 
 22


unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2 percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, in 2018, the CMS began paying for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services. In addition, recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act changed the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products.
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 Although none of our drug candidates has been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our drug candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost-containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:
  
• | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reforming drug importation laws.
--+---------------------------------

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our drug candidates and operate profitably.
 23


Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers and requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on certain drug manufacturers for payments and “transfers of value” made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of pricing and marketing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impact our financial results.
 24


International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
