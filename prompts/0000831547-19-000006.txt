ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Spectrum", the "Company", "we", "our", or "us") is a biopharma company, with a primary strategy comprised of acquiring, developing, and commercializing a broad and diverse pipeline of clinical and commercial products. We have an in-house clinical development organization with regulatory and data management capabilities, in addition to commercial infrastructure and a field-based sales force for our marketed products. Currently, we have seven approved oncology/hematology products (FUSILEV, KHAPZORY, FOLOTYN, ZEVALIN, MARQIBO, BELEODAQ, and EVOMELA) that target different types of cancer including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ("NHL"), advanced metastatic colorectal cancer ("mCRC"), acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL"), and multiple myeloma ("MM").
We also have two drugs in late-stage development:

• | Poziotinib, a novel pan-HER inhibitor under investigation for non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") tumors with either EGFR or HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations; and 


• | ROLONTIS, a novel long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), analog for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

On January 17, 2019, we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement for the sale of our FDA-approved product portfolio of FUSILEV, KHAPZORY, FOLOTYN, ZEVALIN, MARQIBO, BELEODAQ, and EVOMELA to Acrotech Biopharma L.L.C. ("Acrotech"), a New Jersey-based wholly-owned subsidiary of Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc. (the "Acrotech Transaction"). Upon the closing of the Acrotech Transaction, we are entitled to receive up to $160 million in an upfront cash payment (of which $4 million will be held in escrow for six months). In addition, we expect a purchase price adjustment for certain ongoing research and development activities of the commercialized product portfolio. We are also entitled to receive an aggregate $140 million upon Acrotech's achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones relating to this product portfolio. We plan to reduce our staff by approximately 90 employees, the majority of which we expect to transition to

Acrotech. The accounting recognition and financial reporting for the disposal of this commercial component of our business will be reflected in our financial statements in the period corresponding with its closing. 
Cancer Background and Market Size
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, which can result in death. The development of cancer is multi-factorial and includes both external factors (tobacco, infectious organisms, chemicals, and radiation) and internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions, and mutations that occur from exposure to environmental factors or errors in making DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) during normal cell division). These causal factors may act together or in sequence to initiate or promote the development of cancer. Ten or more years often pass between exposure to these factors and the development of detectable cancer. Cancer is treated through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted drug therapy.
According to the American Cancer Society’s publication Cancer Facts & Figures 2018, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. (only behind heart disease). In the U.S., approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in 2018 and approximately 610,000 persons were expected to die from the disease. Anyone can develop cancer. Since the risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases with age, most cases occur in adults who are middle aged or older. About 87% of all cancers are diagnosed in people 50 years of age and older. In the U.S., approximately 40 out of 100 men and 38 out of 100 women will develop cancer during their lifetime. These probabilities are estimated based on the overall experience of the general population. Individuals within the population may have higher or lower risk because of differences in exposures (e.g., smoking), and/or genetic susceptibility. In addition, currently available treatments are variably effective in the different cancers and individual patients. Together these patients’ risks and the treatment limitations suggest a significant current and long-term demand for improved and novel cancer treatments.
Product Portfolio
We currently have a product portfolio consisting of both commercial stage and development stage products that address various cancer types (see the section titled Research and Development below for our pipeline of cancer therapeutics that are in various development stages). Our commercialized products and products in development may have serious adverse effects, or SAEs, that could result in a negative impact on sales and delays, or removal of regulatory approval. For further information on these SAEs, see the risk factor within accompanying Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business --Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving each of our products or similar agents, sold by us or our development partners and/or licensees, could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval or negatively impact sales.
Commercialized Products

FUSILEV 
FUSILEV (levoleucovorin) is a novel folate analog and the pharmacologically active isomer (the levo-isomer) of the racemic compound, calcium leucovorin. Leucovorin is a mixture of equal parts of both isomers: the pharmacologically active levo-isomer and the inactive dextro-isomer. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the inactive dextro-isomer may compete with the active levo-isomer for uptake at the cellular level. By removing the inactive dextro form, the dosage of FUSILEV is one-half that of leucovorin and patients are spared the administration of an inactive substance. FUSILEV is approved as a ready-to-use solution, and as freeze-dried powder. FUSILEV has the following indications for use:

• | in combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced mCRC;


• | for rescue after high-dose methotrexate, or MTX, therapy in osteosarcoma; and


• | to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired MTX elimination and of inadvertent over dosage of folic acid antagonists.

Effective December 2018, FUSILEV has been discontinued and we are no longer selling this product. We have since transitioned to marketing KHAPZORY (see below) for identical indications as FUSILEV.
KHAPZORY
On October 19, 2018, the FDA approved KHAPZORY (levoleucovorin), which is formulated as a freeze-dried powder. KHAPZORY is a novel folate analog and the pharmacologically active levo-isomer of d,1-leucovorin. Preclinical studies have 
3

demonstrated that the inactive dextro-isomer may compete with the active levo-isomer for uptake at the cellular level. By removing the inactive dextro form, the dosage of KHAPZORY is one-half that of leucovorin and patients are spared the administration of an inactive substance. While FUSILEV uses a calcium-based formulation, KHAPZORY uses a sodium-based formulation, though has the same indications for use as FUSILEV.
FOLOTYN
FOLOTYN (pralatrexate injection), a folate analogue metabolic inhibitor, was discovered by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, SRI International and Southern Research Institute, and was developed by Allos Therapeutics, Inc., or Allos. In September 2009, the FDA granted accelerated approval for FOLOTYN for use as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL. FOLOTYN was the first chemotherapy approved by the FDA, under its accelerated approval program, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCL and has been available to patients in the U.S. since October 2009.
According to the Lymphoma Research Foundation, lymphoma is the most common blood cancer. Hodgkin’s lymphoma and NHL are the two main forms of lymphoma. Lymphoma occurs when lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, grow abnormally and accumulate in one or more lymph nodes or lymphoid tissues. The body has two main types of lymphocytes that can develop into lymphomas: B-lymphocytes, or B-cells, and T-lymphocytes, or T-cells. PTCL comprises a group of rare and aggressive NHLs that develop from mature T-cells and accounts for approximately 5 to 15% of all NHL cases in the U.S. and Europe.
Based on preclinical studies, we believe that FOLOTYN selectively enters cancer cells expressing reduced folate carrier, or RFC-1, a protein that is frequently over expressed on cancer cells compared to normal cells. Once inside cancer cells, FOLOTYN is efficiently polyglutamylated and retained inside the cells for a longer time. FOLOTYN and its polyglutamates inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, or DHFR, an enzyme critical in the folate pathway, thereby interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis and triggering cancer cell death.
The safety and efficacy of FOLOTYN was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, international trial that enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. One hundred and eleven patients were treated with FOLOTYN at 30 mg/m² once weekly by IV push over three to five minutes for six weeks in seven-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Of the 111 patients treated, 109 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (complete response, complete response unconfirmed, and partial response) as assessed by International Workshop Criteria, or IWC. Of the 109 evaluable patients, 27% of patients achieved a response that met these criteria. 
In addition to its approved indication, FOLOTYN is being investigated in a Phase 1 study in combination with the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy regimen. Once the proper dose of FOLOTYN in combination with CHOP has been determined, a Phase 3 study of the combinations of FOLOTYN and CHOP, and BELEODAQ and CHOP, compared to CHOP alone for the treatment of first line PTCL may be initiated. The Phase 1 study and the Phase 3 study concept are also the current post-marketing requirements for the FDA’s accelerated approval of our currently marketed indication for FOLOTYN. 
BELEODAQ
BELEODAQ (belinostat) is a histone deacytelase, or HDAC, inhibitor for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. This indication was FDA approved in July 2014 under its accelerated approval program, based on tumor response rate and duration of response. BELEODAQ's anticancer effect is thought to be mediated through multiple mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death), inhibition of angiogenesis, induction of differentiation, and the activity in tumors that had become resistant to anticancer agents such as the platinums, taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors.
The safety and effectiveness of BELEODAQ was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized international trial involving 129 participants with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Patients were treated with BELEODAQ 1,000 mg/m2 administered over 30 minutes via IV infusion once daily on days one to five of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate (complete response and partial response) as assessed by an independent review committee, or IRC, using IWC. In all evaluable patients (N = 120) treated with BELEODAQ, the overall response rate per central review using IWC was 25.8%.
We market FOLOTYN and BELEODAQ for the treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCL. These drugs have different mechanisms of action, and as a result, the treating physician may prefer to start treatment with one drug over the other. In 
4

addition, physicians may prefer one drug over another based on specific patient factors such as the subtype of PTCL being treated, existing comorbidities, or the performance status of the patient. However, both drugs have similar response rates of approximately 25-30%. It is common for patients to cycle through multiple drugs, including both FOLOTYN and BELEODAQ, though these drugs are not FDA-approved for use in combination with one another. 
In addition to its approved indication, BELEODAQ has been investigated in a Phase 1 study in combination with the CHOP chemotherapy regimen. Once the proper dose of FOLOTYN in combination with CHOP has been determined, a Phase 3 study may be assessed for the combination of BELEODAQ and CHOP and FOLOTYN and CHOP, compared to CHOP alone for the treatment of first line PTCL. The Phase 1 study and the Phase 3 study concept are also the current post-marketing requirements for the FDA's accelerated approval of our currently marketed indication for BELEODAQ. 
ZEVALIN
ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous use is a prescription medication that is part of a three step treatment regimen consisting of: two treatments of Rituximab and one treatment of Yttrium-90 (Y-90) ZEVALIN. The National Cancer Institute, or NCI, estimated 75,000 new cases of NHL in the U.S. in 2018. Rituximab is used to reduce the number of B-cells in the blood and Y-90 ZEVALIN is then given to treat NHL. It is currently approved in the U.S. and more than 40 countries outside the U.S. including countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia for (i) treatment of patients with recurring, low-grade or follicular B-cell NHL after other anticancer drugs are no longer working, and (ii) newly diagnosed follicular NHL following a response to initial anticancer therapy.
MARQIBO
MARQIBO (vincristine sulfate liposome injection) is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated formulation of the FDA-approved anticancer drug Vincristine. MARQIBO’s approved indication is for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative - ALL, or Ph-ALL, in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more lines of anti-leukemia therapy. According to the NCI, in 2018 it is estimated that there will be approximately 6,000 patients diagnosed with ALL in the U.S., of which approximately 1,600 can be categorized as ALL in second or greater relapse.
MARQIBO was studied in an international, open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with Ph-ALL in second or greater relapse or whose disease progressed after two or greater treatment lines of anti-leukemia therapy. Patients received intravenous MARQIBO monotherapy at 2.25 mg/m2 over 60 minutes every seven days. The treated population included 65 patients who received at least one dose of MARQIBO. Of the 65 evaluable patients, three (4.6%) achieved complete remission, or CR, seven (10.8%) achieved complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi, for a total of 10 (15.4%) total patients who achieved a CR or CRi.
In addition to its approved indication, MARQIBO is being investigated in pediatric ALL in a Phase 1 investigator-initiated study in the U.S. Based on data from this study, Spectrum will determine whether to conduct a registration study for MARQIBO in this setting. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding the possibility of using this development plan to satisfy one of the post-marketing requirements for the accelerated approval of our currently marketed indication for MARQIBO. 
MARQIBO is also being investigated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a Phase 3 investigator-initiated study in Europe in combination with the standard CHOP chemotherapy regimen in Europe, CHOP-14. Based on interim data from this study, Spectrum will consider whether to conduct a study of the combination of MARQIBO with the standard CHOP regimen in the U.S., CHOP-21 may be initiated.
EVOMELA
EVOMELA is intended for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT, for patients with MM. MM is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell present mainly in the bone marrow that produces antibodies. In MM, a group of plasma cells (myeloma cells) become cancerous and multiply, raising the number of plasma cells to a higher-than-normal level, which can crowd out normal blood cells and lead to abnormally high proteins in the blood or urine. The NCI estimated 31,000 new cases of MM in the U.S. in 2018, with the incidence of new cases increasing by approximately 2% per year.

The EVOMELA formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, or PG, which is required as a co-solvent in the currently-available formulation of this product. The use of Betadex Sulfobutyl Ether Sodium technology to reformulate EVOMELA may allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to avoid reductions.
EVOMELA was approved by the FDA based on its bioequivalence to the standard melphalan formulation (Alkeran) via the new drug regulatory pathway provided by Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The safety and effectiveness of EVOMELA in high-dose conditioning treatment was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized trial. The objective of the trial was to determine the overall safety and toxicity profile of 200 mg/m2 of EVOMELA in patients with MM undergoing ASCT. The overall response rate (partial response or better) improved from 79% prior to the ASCT procedure to 95% at 90 to 100 days post-transplant. There was also an increase in the number of patients with a stringent complete response from zero patients prior to the ASCT procedure to 16% at 90 to 100 days post-transplant. Myeloablation, neutrophil engraftment, and platelet engraftment were achieved by all 61 patients. Myeloablation occurred on day five of ASCT (range of ASCT days was one to six) with the median time to myeloablation from dosing of eight days. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 12 days (range of ASCT days was 10 to 16). The median time to platelet engraftment was 13 days (range of ASCT days was 10 to 28).
New Product Pipeline
Poziotinib
Poziotinib is a novel, pan-HER inhibitor that irreversibly blocks signaling through the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR, HER) Family of tyrosine-kinase receptors, including HER1 (erbB1; EGFR), HER2 (erbB2), HER4 (erbB4), and HER receptor mutations. This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells that over-express these receptors. Mutations or over-expression/amplification of EGFR family receptors have been associated with a number of different cancers, including NSCLC, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 
Our clinical development program for poziotinib is focused on four pillars, including previously treated NSCLC, first-line treatment of NSCLC, combination therapy and treatment of other solid tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutations. Specifically, we are investigating poziotinib for the treatment of NSCLC tumors with either EGFR or HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations. NSCLC tumors with EGFR or HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations are rare, and have generally not been responsive to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients with these mutations have a poor prognosis, and available treatment options are limited. Poziotinib, due to its unique chemical structure and characteristics, is believed to inhibit cell growth of EGFR or HER2 exon-20 insertions. In collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ("MD Anderson"), an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial was initiated in NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon-20 mutations (the "MD Anderson Phase 2 Trial"). The EGFR cohort of 50 patients has completed enrollment; the enrollment of the HER2 cohort of 30 patients is ongoing. In addition to the MD Anderson study, we have ongoing pivotal Phase 2 global study with active sites in the U.S., Canada, and Europe ("ZENITH20"). 
In April 2018, poziotinib data were published in Nature Medicine from the ongoing study led by MD Anderson, which provided an update on the preliminary clinical data of poziotinib dosing on the 11 NSCLC patients previously reported at World Conference on Lung Cancer in October 2017. This publication summarized the current preclinical and clinical data with poziotinib for EGFR or HER2 exon-20 mutations. MD Anderson utilized in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon-20 mutations and identify potentially effective inhibitors. 3-D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. It was found that poziotinib, due to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes, and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon-20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ("TKIs") in vitro and in EGFR or HER2 exon-20 mutant patient-derived xenograft models, and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC.
In September 2018 we announced preliminary poziotinib data from the MD Anderson Phase 2 NSCLC study which were released during an oral presentation at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer. The MD Anderson study is the single largest data set of patients with an exon 20 mutation in EGFR or HER2.  This Phase 2 study demonstrated high anti-tumor activity for poziotinib in metastatic, heavily pretreated EGFR exon 20 mutant NSCLC, a group for which no targeted agents have proven to be effective to date. This data is summarized below:

• | In 44 evaluable patients with EGFR exon-20 mutations, the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was 43% and disease control rate was 90%. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months (ITT).


• | In evaluable patients with HER2 exon-20 mutations, the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was 42% and disease control rate was 83%. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months (ITT).

6


• | EGFR-related toxicities (including rash, diarrhea, and paronychia) were manageable and required dose reductions in 60% of patients. Discontinuation due to poor tolerance was rare (approximately 3% of patients).

On January 2, 2019 we announced full enrollment of cohort 1 (N=87) for previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations with sites across the U.S., Europe, and Canada. The EGFR previously treated cohort is part of the ZENITH20 trial - an open-label, multi-center, global Phase 2 trial evaluating NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Results from this cohort are expected by the second half of 2019.
We have also been studying poziotinib in patients with HER2+ breast cancer, however we are no longer focusing on studying poziotinib in this group of patients as the unmet need is not as significant as it is for patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. A Phase 2 study including patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, who have failed at least two HER2 directed therapies, has been fully enrolled. A Phase 1b study testing the combination of poziotinib and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with metastatic breast cancer has now been closed to further enrollment.
ROLONTIS
ROLONTIS (eflapegrastim injection) is a novel long-acting G-CSF that employs a proprietary technology to enhance the duration of therapeutic effects and reduces the frequency of administration. ROLONTIS is being investigated for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In January 2012, we entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement for ROLONTIS worldwide rights, except for Korea, China, and Japan, with Hanmi, based on their proprietary LAPSCOVERY™ technology. 
Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression and unacceptably low levels of white blood cells, making patients prone to infections, hospitalizations, and interruption of chemotherapy treatments.
Neutropenia, a common side effect of chemotherapy, is a condition where the number of neutrophils or white blood cells are too low, and can lead to infection, hospitalization, and even death. G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells by the bone marrow. A recombinant form of G-CSF is used in appropriate cancer patients to accelerate recovery from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens to be given at full-dose and on schedule. The worldwide annual market opportunity for long-acting G-CSF-related drugs is over $4 billion, based on a 2016 revenue and sales analysis performed by Evaluate Pharma. 
In December 2015, we reached agreement with the FDA regarding our Phase 3 Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for ROLONTIS. This pivotal Phase 3 study (ADVANCE Study, or SPI-GCF-301) was initiated in the first quarter of 2016 to evaluate ROLONTIS as a treatment for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We announced in February 2018 that the top line results of this study met the non-inferiority of ROLONTIS to pegfilgrastim endpoint in the Duration of Severe Neutropenia, or DSN, across all four cycles (all p<0.0001). We initiated a second pivotal Phase 3 study (RECOVER Study, or SPI-GCF-302) and announced in June 2018, that it had also met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority in DSN between ROLONTIS and pegfilgrastim. 
We submitted our Biologics License Application ("BLA") with the FDA in late December 2018. Due to the recent federal government shutdown, the BLA was officially received by the FDA on January 28, 2019. Once this BLA is accepted by the FDA, our Prescription Drug User Fee Act date is expected to be set for 10 months thereafter.
QAPZOLA 
QAPZOLA is a potent tumor-activated drug that is being tested in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ("NMIBC"). The NCI estimates that the 2018 incidence and prevalence of bladder cancer in the U.S. was approximately 79,000 cases. The global presence of bladder cancer is estimated at 2.7 million cases. According to Botteman et al., (PharmacoEconomics 2003), bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to treat on a lifetime basis. The overall cost of bladder cancer treatment in the U.S. is approximately $3.4 billion annually, most of which is related to the direct treatment of this disease. 
The initial treatment of bladder cancer is to attempt a complete surgical removal of the tumor. However, bladder cancer is a highly recurrent disease with approximately 80% of patients recurring within five years, and a majority of patients recurring within two years. This high recurrence rate is attributed to:

• | the highly implantable nature of cancer cells that are dispersed during surgery;


• | incomplete tumor resection; and

7


• | tumors present in multiple locations in the bladder which may be missed or too small to visualize at the time of resection.

Despite evidence in the published literature and guidance from the American and European Urology Associations, instillation of a chemotherapeutic agent immediately following surgery is not a standard clinical practice. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for this indication which may, in part, explain the difference between the literature and urology guidelines and actual clinical management of this disease. For more than 30 years, no new drugs have been introduced in the market for treatment of NMIBC. QAPZOLA represents much needed therapy for patients and may provide a meaningful opportunity to reduce overall medical costs.
Pharmacokinetic studies have verified that QAPZOLA is rarely detectable in the bloodstream of patients when it is administered either after surgical resection or as a part of a delayed multi-instillation protocol. QAPZOLA is inactivated in the systemic circulation by the red blood cell fraction. The proposed dose therefore carries a minimal risk of systemic toxicity that could arise from absorption of a drug through the bladder wall into the bloodstream. An immediate instillation of QAPZOLA may help by:


• | reducing tumor recurrence by destroying dispersed cancer cells that would otherwise re-implant onto the inner lining of the bladder;


• | destroying remaining cancer cells at the site of tumor resection (also known as chemo-resection); and


• | destroying tumors not observed during resection (also known as chemo-ablation).

We submitted an NDA on December 11, 2015, which was accepted on February 9, 2016. In November 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA. In February 2017, we received a SPA from the FDA for our redesigned Phase 3 study of QAPZOLA. The new Phase 3 study has been specifically designed to build on learnings from the previous studies as well as recommendations from the FDA. The Phase 3 study is currently enrolling up to 425 evaluable patients, using a single dose of 8 mg of QAPZOLA, and will evaluate time-to-recurrence as the primary endpoint.

Additionally, for information regarding possible adverse events or safety concerns regarding our commercialized and development stage products, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving each of our products or similar agents, sold by us or our development partners and/or licensees, could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval or negatively impact sales.
Manufacturing
We currently do not have internal manufacturing capabilities; therefore, all of our products are manufactured on a contract basis. We expect to continue to contract with third-party providers for manufacturing and packaging services, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and finished-dosage products. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand and clinical requirements for our products. Where technically feasible, we maintain secondary supplier sources for our drug products to mitigate the risk of over-reliance on any one supplier. We attempt to prevent supply disruption through supply agreements, appropriate forecasting, and maintaining base stock levels. 
Sales and Marketing
We presently market our pharmaceutical products through group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, wholesalers or directly to major hospitals and cancer centers in the U.S., except for our U.S. sales of ZEVALIN, in which case we sell directly to the end-user; and through distributors in Europe (and previously in Japan). Most of our revenues are derived from sales within the U.S. For information regarding the portion of our revenue attributable to sales outside the U.S., see Note 5, "Composition of Total Revenue," to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Our U.S. sales team is divided between “corporate accounts” and “oncology accounts” that generally interact with different end-user types. The primary decision makers for our products are oncologists and hematologists. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. sales force (sales management, sales representatives, and sales administrative support) numbered 61 employees.

During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, each of FOLOTYN, EVOMELA and BELEODAQ accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. The percentage of our total revenue contributed by such products in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
FOLOTYN | 43.9 | % | | 33.5 | % | 31.6 | %
EVOMELA | 25.9 | % | | 27.4 | % | 11.1 | %
BELEODAQ | 11.3 | % | | 9.6 | % | 9.1 | %

Customers
Our product sales are concentrated to large pharmaceutical distributors (that ship and bill to hospitals and clinics). The customers that represented 10% or more of our total gross product sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:

 | Product Sales
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
McKesson Corporation and its affiliates | 36.3 | % | | 31.1 | % | 31.0 | %
AmerisourceBergen Corporation and its affiliates | 29.1 | % | | 32.3 | % | 38.4 | %
Cardinal Health, Inc. and its affiliates | 22.0 | % | | 26.3 | % | 24.0 | %

We are exposed to credit risk associated with trade receivables that result from these product sales. We do not require collateral or deposits from our customers due to our assessment of their creditworthiness and our long-standing relationship with them. We maintain reserves for potential bad debt, though credit losses have historically been nominal and within management’s expectations. A summary of our customers that represented 10% or more of our “accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts,” as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 

 | Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017
AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and its affiliates | 35.0 | % | | 22.2 | %
Cardinal Health, Inc. and its affiliates | 27.5 | % | | 29.5 | %
McKesson Corporation and its affiliates | 25.5 | % | | 34.7 | %

See Note 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional summaries of revenue by geography and product/service source.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly-evolving technology and intense competition, which we expect will continue. Many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to ours – both commercialized and in development, which fosters continuous innovation. In the event that one or more of our competitor’s programs are successful, the market for some of our drug products could be reduced or eliminated. Any product for which we obtain FDA approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share.
Successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety, and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals, academic institutions, and managed care organizations. Competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease, advanced drug delivery, and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies. Unless our products are shown to be differentiated, i.e., have a better safety profile, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, compared to other alternatives, they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be commercially successful.

Companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products include, among others, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Endo International plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis International AG, Genentech, Inc. (Roche Holding AG), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Seattle Genetics, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Biogen Inc., OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Astellas Pharma Inc.), Cephalon, Inc. (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), Sanofi S.A., Pfizer, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Celgene Corporation, BiPar Sciences, Inc. (Sanofi S.A.), Sanofi Genzyme, Shire plc, AbbVie Inc., Poniard Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, Inc., Coherus BioSciences, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.
Each of the aforementioned companies may be more advanced in the development of competing drug products. Many of these competitors are large and well-capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of cancers and drug indications, and have substantially greater resources and expertise than we do.
We believe that the current competitive landscape for each of our commercialized products, and key in-development products, is as follows:


(a) | KHAPZORY is the sodium levo-isomeric form of the racemic compound calcium, leucovorin, a product already approved for the same indication as FUSILEV. There are several generic companies approved by the FDA to sell the calcium leucovorin product, we are competing with lower-cost alternatives.


(b) | ZEVALIN has two competitive products for its currently approved indications:


• | Rituxan® (rituximab), marketed by Genentech Inc. and Biogen Inc., is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent; previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone combination) chemotherapy; and non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL, as a single agent, after first-line CVP chemotherapy. Rituxan is administered as a part of various chemotherapy regimens and schedules, the vast majority of which, could be used in concert with other therapeutic agents, such as ZEVALIN, as part of a treatment plan.


• | Bendeka® (bendamustine hydrochloride) for Injection, for Intravenous Infusion, marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., is indicated for the treatment of patients with indolent B-cell NHL that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.


(c) | FOLOTYN, was the first agent approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. BELEODAQ is a HDAC inhibitor, also indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Both drugs were approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival has not been demonstrated. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

There are many existing approaches used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCL, including combination chemotherapy and single agent regimens, which represent competition for FOLOTYN and BELEODAQ. Both drugs have two primary competitive products for their currently approved indications:

• | Istodax® (Romidepsin), marketed by Celgene Corporation, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in June 2011 for the treatment of patients with PTCL who have received at least one prior therapy.


• | Adcetris® (Brentuximab vedotin), marketed by Seattle Genetics, Inc., was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August 2011 for the treatment of patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or ALCL, after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. ALCL is one of the subtypes of PTCL included in the labels of FOLOTYN, BELEODAQ and Istodax.

We are aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied in clinical trials for PTCL which, if approved, may compete with FOLOTYN and BELEODAQ. Many patients with PTCL do not adequately respond to a single treatment agent, so many patients receive treatment with more than one agent (e.g., BELEODAQ and FOLOTYN). 


(d) | MARQIBO is a liposomal form of standard vincristine. In its current indication, MARQIBO is approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph-ALL who have not responded or relapsed after two prior treatments. This indication received the FDA's accelerated approval based on tumor response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement

10

in overall survival has not been verified. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
Currently, standard vincristine is not approved for the same indication as MARQIBO. However, there are many existing approaches used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory Ph-ALL, including combination chemotherapy and single agent regimens, which represent competition for MARQIBO. There are a variety of investigational agents in clinical trials for ALL that if approved could represent future competition for MARQIBO.

(e) | EVOMELA is a propylene glycol-free formulation. Given its unique formulation, there are no generic forms of EVOMELA on the market. However, there are currently several generic forms of melphalan used in the treatment of MM, which represent direct competition for EVOMELA. The current companies with forms of generic melphalan include Mylan, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Sagent Pharmaceuticals, PAR Pharmaceutical Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and Fresenius Kabi Global.

(f) ROLONTIS is a novel long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that employs a proprietary technology that prolongs the duration of biologics, reducing the frequency of administration. There is currently one novel long-acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and two biosimilar G-CSFs marketed in the United States including, Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), marketed by Amgen, Inc., UDENYCA™ (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), a biosimilar marketed by Coherus BioSciences, and Fulphila® (pegfilgrastim-jmdb), a biosimilar marketed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(g) | Poziotinib is a novel investigational, oral, quinazoline-based pan-HER inhibitor that irreversibly blocks signaling through the EGFR family of tyrosine-kinase receptors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1\ErbB1/EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4), as well as HER receptor mutations. Poziotinib’s development program is primarily focused on advanced NSCLC patients harboring exon 20 insertion mutations in both HER1/Erb1/EGFR and HER2(ErbB2). At present there are no FDA approved therapies for metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutations expect for afatinib, which is FDA- approved for S768I point mutations.

There are a number of other targeted therapies focused on this subtype of NSCLC that are in early clinical investigation by our potential competitors, including: TAK788 - Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TAGRISSO (Osimertinib) - AstraZeneca, Tarloxotinib - Rain Therapeutics Inc., DS-8201a - Daiichi Sankyo, and JNJ-61186372- Janssen Research & Development.
Research and Development
New drug development is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing an NDA or a BLA, in the U.S. (or similar filing in other countries). Obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. is an inherently uncertain, lengthy, and expensive process that requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory authorities that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications. Our development focus is primarily based on acquiring and developing late-stage development drugs as compared to new drug discovery, which is particularly uncertain and lengthy.
Our in-development products are summarized below: 
11

Our research and development expenses for drug development are comprised of our personnel expenses, contracted services with third parties, license fees and milestone payments to third parties, clinical trial costs, laboratory supplies, drug products, and certain allocations of corporate costs. The below table summarizes our research and development expenses by project in 2018, 2017, and 2016:

Patents and Proprietary Rights
Overview
12

We in-license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary drug products. Under most of these license arrangements, we are generally responsible for all development, patent filing and maintenance costs, sales, marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug products.
In addition, these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably utilize the underlying technology of applicable patents. If we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements, we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products, which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business. For more information regarding these arrangements see Note 17(b), "Financial Commitments & Contingencies and License Agreements," to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The protection, preservation and infringement-free commercial utilization of these patents and related intellectual property rights are very important to the successful execution of our strategy. However, the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents and the patents we have licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not allowed or, even if allowed and issued as patents, if such patents or the patents we have in-licensed are circumvented or not upheld by the courts, our ability to competitively utilize our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially sell these products may be diminished.
From time-to-time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented.
Commercialized and In-Development Drug Products - Patents and Licenses Summary
We believe that our patents and licenses are critical to operating our business, as summarized below by commercialized and in-development drug products.
FUSILEV: FUSILEV had orphan drug exclusivity for two indications. Marketing of the product has been discontinued in the U.S. beginning in December 2018. 
ZEVALIN: We have sublicensed U.S. patents that cover the processes and tools for making monoclonal anti-bodies or MABs, in general, licensed U.S. patents that cover the CD-20 MAB in ZEVALIN as well as the use of ZEVALIN to treat NHL, and acquired patents covering the ZEVALIN compounding process (i.e., process of linking the CD-20 MAB to a radioactive isotope to make the patient-ready dosage form of ZEVALIN). These patents expire over a wide range of dates, and the licensed patents covering the CD-20 MAB began to expire in 2015. Additionally, we have U.S. patents covering the compounding process expiring in 2019.
FOLOTYN: We have a composition of matter patent due to expire in November 2022, following a five-year patent term extension in the U.S., as well as through confidential settlement agreements executed in June 2016 with five parties resulting from Paragraph IV certifications in connection with four separate ANDAs to manufacture a generic version of FOLOTYN. The composition of matter patent expired in Europe in 2017. 
We also have patents covering the use of FOLOTYN for PTCL that will not expire until 2025. We have filed for extension of this patent in Japan where FOLOTYN was approved in 2017. If the extension is granted, the patent will be extended by approximately 3 years and 11 months. The use patent is eligible for similar patent term extension in Europe following regulatory approval. 
BELEODAQ: The composition of matter patents that cover BELEODAQ and related compounds do not begin to expire until 2021. We have applied for extension of the composition of matter patent in US. If an extension is granted, the patent will expire in 2026. In addition, there is a formulation patent which will not expire until 2027 in the U.S. Currently, there are multiple U.S. and foreign patent applications pending that cover BELEODAQ formulations, uses and manufacturing and synthesis processes. 
We and Onxeo have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Fresenius which triggered an automatic stay of this ANDA for 30 months, which will expire in April of 2021. The trial is currently scheduled to start in February of 2021. In addition, BELOEDAQ is protected from competition in the U.S. by an Orphan Drug Exclusivity indication until July 3, 2021.
13

MARQIBO: We have U.S. and European patents covering the use of MARQIBO for leukemia, lymphoma and melanoma, and a U.S. patent covering the MARQIBO kit, all expiring in 2020. We have filed a patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, application claiming a method of encapsulating vincristine sulphate into liposomes. We are presently in the process of developing a “single vial” formulation of MARQIBO and filed patent applications covering the formulation worldwide. If we are successful, we believe our patent coverage could be extended to 2036.
EVOMELA: This drug is covered by issued patents claiming improved Captisol® technology that are due to expire between 2025 and 2034 in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we have issued patents that cover improved Captisol technology that are due to expire in 2025 and pending applications with anticipated expiry in 2029 (if issued). We also have filed patent applications covering the Captisol-based formulation of EVOMELA in the U.S. and a number of other countries.
EVOMELA has orphan drug exclusivity for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with MM, which expires on March 10, 2023.
We obtained global development and commercialization rights to EVOMELA from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand, in March 2013. We thereafter assumed responsibility for completing its clinical trials and were responsible for filing the NDA. Under our license agreement with Ligand, Ligand received a license fee and is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties. On December 20, 2017, CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Ligand company, filed an action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., and Actavis, LLC, together Teva, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging patent infringement with respect to a paragraph IV certification, or an ANDA, filed with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of EVOMELA. Ligand brought suit against Teva to protect its intellectual property rights.
KHAPZORY: The U.S. patent application is currently underway, and depending its outcome, it may provide intellectual property protections for this product.
Poziotinib: A composition of matter patent covering poziotinib is due to expire in 2028. The patent is eligible for patent term extension following regulatory approval. Poziotinib is also covered by additional patents and patent applications covering its formulations and synthetic processes which will expire between 2032 and 2034. We are also considering filing of additional patent applications covering new formulations and uses.
QAPZOLA: The U.S. formulation patent for QAPZOLA does not expire until 2022, and a patent for the method of treatment of bladder cancer using a stabilized formulation does not expire until 2024. Formulation patents outside the U.S. are due to expire in 2022. We have filed additional U.S. and foreign patent applications covering new formulations and/or uses for this product.
ROLONTIS: Composition of matter patents covering ROLONTIS are due to expire in 2025 in the U.S. and in 2024 outside the U.S. We also have a ROLONTIS formulation patent granted in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries. The formulation patent will not expire until 2031. One of these patents is eligible for patent term extension following regulatory approval of ROLONTIS. ROLONTIS is also covered by additional patents and pending applications claiming various aspects of the technology that are due to expire between 2024 and 2030.
Patent Protection and Value Maximization 
We are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently assessing and filing patent applications for our drug products and considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products.
While the U.S. and the European Union, or EU, are currently the largest potential markets for most of our products, we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the U.S. and Europe. Limitations on patent protection in these countries, and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the U.S., may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the U.S. In addition, laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the U.S.
To minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection, we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the U.S., the EU, Canada, and Japan. In determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country, we weigh the relevant costs and benefits, and consider, among other things, the market potential and profitability, the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability, and the nature of terms with any potential licensees. Failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets.
14

In conducting our business, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and licensing arrangements. We use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements and trade secret protection measures. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. The protection of know-how is particularly important because it is often necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary drug products.
In addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above, we have trademark registrations in the U.S. for Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.®, FUSILEV®, FOLOTYN®, ZEVALIN®, MARQIBO®, BELEODAQ®, EVOMELA®, and ROLONTIS®. We also have trademarks in KHAPZORY™, REDEFINING CANCER CARE™, and the Spectrum Pharmaceuticals' logos. Any other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
The Patent Process
The U.S. Constitution provides Congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries. Congress codified this right in U.S. Code Title 35, which gave the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a U.S. patent. This process involves the filing of a patent application that instructs a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms. The invention must be novel (i.e., not previously known) and non-obvious (i.e., not an obvious extension of what is already known). The patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention.
The USPTO undertakes an examination process that can take from one to seven years, or more, depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination.
In exchange for disclosing the invention to the public, for all U.S. patent applications filed after 1995, the successful patent applicant is currently provided a right to exclude others from making, using or selling the claimed invention for a period of 20 years from the effective filing date of the patent application.
Under certain circumstances, a patent term may be extended. Patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, to recover some of the time lost during the FDA regulatory process, subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. The patent term may be extended up to a maximum of five years, but cannot be extended beyond a total of 14 years from the date of the product's approval; however, as a general rule, the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years. Only one patent can be extended per FDA approved product, and a patent can only be extended once.
Product Exclusivity
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, drug products are provided exclusivity whereby the FDA will not approve applications to market a generic form of an innovator reference listed drug product until the end of the prescribed period. A product is granted a five-year period of exclusivity if it contains a chemical entity never previously approved by the FDA either alone or in combination, although generic applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement as further discussed below. A three-year period of exclusivity is granted to a previously approved product based on certain changes (e.g., in strength, dosage form, route of administration or conditions of use), where the application is supported by new clinical investigations that are essential to approval. In addition, in 1997, Congress amended the law to provide an additional six months of exclusivity as a reward for studying drugs in children. This pediatric exclusivity, which can be obtained during the approval process or after approval, effectively prevents the FDA from approving a generic application until six months after the expiration of any patent. In order to qualify for pediatric exclusivity, the FDA must make a written request for pediatric studies, the application holder must agree to the request and complete the studies within the required timeframe, and the studies must be accepted by the FDA based on a determination that the studies fairly respond to the request. 
Generic Approval and Patent Certification
The Hatch-Waxman Act also created the ANDA approval process, which permits the approval of a generic version of a previously approved branded drug without the submission of a full NDA, and based in part on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference listed drug. Applicants submitting an NDA are required to list patents associated with the drug product, which are published in the FDA Orange Book, and the timing of an ANDA approval depends in part on patent 
15

protection for the branded drug. When an ANDA is filed, the applicant must file a certification for each of the listed patents for the branded drug, stating one of the following: (1) that there is no patent information listed; (2) that such patent has expired; (3) that the patent will expire on a particular date (indicating that the ANDA may be approved on that date); or (4) that the drug for which approval is sought either does not infringe the patent or the patent is unenforceable or invalid, otherwise known as paragraph IV certification. If an ANDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, it is required to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification. If the patent holder brings suit against the ANDA applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving notice, generally the FDA may not approve the ANDA until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the patent holder’s receipt of the notice (the 30-month stay) or (ii) the issuance of a final, non-appealed, or non-appealable court decision finding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provided an incentive for generic manufacturers to file paragraph IV certifications challenging patents that may be invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whereby the first company to successfully challenge a listed patent and receive ANDA approval is protected from competition from subsequent generic versions of the same drug product for up to 180 days after the earlier of (1) the date of the first commercial marketing of the first-filed ANDA applicant’s generic drug or (2) the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. These 180-day exclusivity provisions have been the subject of litigation and administrative review, and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, amended the provisions in several ways, including by providing that an ANDA applicant entitled to 180-day exclusivity may lose such exclusivity if any of the following events occur: (1) failure to market; (2) withdrawal of the ANDA; (3) change in patent certification; (4) failure to obtain tentative approval; (5) illegal settlement agreement; or (6) patent expiration.
With respect to the illegal settlement prong, the MMA amendments require that certain types of settlement agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs are required to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for review of potential anti-competitive practices. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies, and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies. The impact of this requirement, and the potential governmental investigations and private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, remains uncertain. In addition, Congress has considered enacting legislation that would prohibit such settlements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers. Such a provision was considered as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010. However, Congress removed the provision prior to passage. It is possible that Congress will again consider a ban on such settlements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers in the future.
The PPACA provides exclusivity protections for certain innovator biological products and a framework for FDA review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable versions of innovator biologic products. The PPACA provides that no application for a biosimilar product may be approved until 12 years after the date on which the innovator product was first licensed, and no application may be submitted until four years after the date of first licensure. Products deemed interchangeable (as opposed to biosimilar) are also eligible for certain exclusivity.
Orphan Drug Designation
Some jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as “orphan” drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., and a drug may also be considered an orphan even if the drug treats a disease or condition affecting more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and process for marketing approval. If a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Also, competitors are not prohibited from receiving approval to market the same drug or biologic for a different indication than that which received orphan approval.
Under EU medicines laws, the criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Criteria for orphan designation are set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000 on the basis of two alternative conditions. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, when the application is made. This is commonly known as the “disease prevalence criterion,” Alternatively, a product may be so designated if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and 
16

chronic condition in the EU and if, without incentives, it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. This is commonly known as the “insufficient return criterion.”
These two alternative criteria must cumulatively meet the second condition that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. “Significant benefit” is defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000 as a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care.
Upon grant of a marketing authorization, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in respect of the approved therapeutic indication. Within the period of market exclusivity, no competent authority in the EU is permitted to accept an application for marketing authorization, a variation or a line-extension for the same approved therapeutic indication in respect of a similar medicinal product pursuant to Article 8.1 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000 unless one of the derogations set out in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation applies. In order to determine whether two products are considered similar, Regulation (EC) 847/2000 requires an assessment of the principal molecular structure and the underlying mode of action. Any minor variation or modification of the principal molecular structure would not ordinarily render the second product dissimilar to the first authorized product.
In order for the second applicant to break the market exclusivity granted to the first authorized similar medicinal product in respect of the same therapeutic indication, the second applicant would principally rely upon data to demonstrate that its product is safer, more efficacious or clinically superior to the first product pursuant to Article 8.3(i) of Regulation (EC) 141/2000. Ordinarily, such an assessment will require a head-to-head comparative clinical trial for the purpose of demonstrating clinical superiority.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation on the basis of available evidence. We have in the past received, and currently hold, orphan drug designations for some of our products.
 Currently, BELEODAQ has orphan drug designation for use in PTCL, and EVOMELA has orphan drug designation as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with MM. In addition, MARQIBO has orphan drug designations for its use in the treatment of adult patients with ALL in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies, and ZEVALIN has orphan drug designations for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell NHL, including patients with Rituximab refractory follicular NHL. 
Governmental Regulation
The development, production and marketing of our proprietary and biologic products are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. In the U.S., drugs and biologics are subject to rigorous regulation. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended from time to time, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, promotion, and advertising of our products. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and to obtain FDA approval, a product must satisfy mandatory quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. In addition, each drug-manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA. Domestic manufacturing establishments must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations and are subject to inspections by the FDA. To supply drug ingredients or products for use in the U.S., foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cGMP and are subject to inspections by the FDA or by other regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA.
General Information about the Drug Approval Process and Post-Marketing Requirements
The U.S. system of new drug and biologics approval is a rigorous process. Only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre-clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization. Our strategy focuses on in-licensing clinical stage drug products that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials. A late-stage focus helps us to effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many hurdles in the pre-clinical and early clinical process.
The following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary products.
17

Pre-clinical Testing: During the pre-clinical testing stage, laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug or biologic compound against the targeted disease. The compound is evaluated for safety. While some of our compounds are currently in clinical trials, it is possible that additional pre-clinical testing could be requested by a regulatory authority for any of our compounds.
Investigational New Drug Application: After certain pre-clinical studies are completed, an IND application is submitted to the FDA to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug or biologic. An IND becomes effective thirty days after the FDA receives the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold), or upon prior notification by the FDA.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: These trials typically involve small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients and usually define a drug candidate’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: In Phase 2 clinical trials, controlled studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug’s effectiveness. These studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels, dose schedules and route(s) of administration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic on humans, as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following Phase 1. These clinical trials, and Phase 3 trials discussed below, are designed to evaluate the product’s overall benefit-risk profile, and to provide information for physician labeling.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: This Phase usually involves a larger number of patients with the targeted disease. Investigators (typically physicians) monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate’s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long-term use of the drug on a large, more widespread, patient population. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease.
New Drug Application or Biologics License Application: After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA or BLA is filed with the FDA requesting FDA approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease.
Fast Track and Priority Review: The FDA has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious or life-threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. As discussed above, we have obtained accelerated approval to market FOLOTYN, BELEODAQ and
MARQIBO.
Abbreviated New Drug Application: An ANDA is an abbreviated new drug application for generic drugs created by the Hatch-Waxman Act. When a company files an ANDA, it must make a patent certification regarding the patents covering the branded product listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. The ANDA drug development process generally takes less time than the NDA drug development process since the ANDA process usually does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation: A BTD is available from the FDA for drugs or drug combinations used to treat serious or life-threatening disease conditions based on preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may offer substantial improvement over existing therapies. FDA may grant priority approval to breakthrough drug indications. FDA may also grant accelerated approval and priority review for drugs that fill an unmet medical need. An advantage to this designation is that clinical trials may use surrogate endpoints to predict clinical benefit, requiring less time than other objective endpoints such as overall survival. 
NDA/BLA and ANDA Approval: The FDA approves drugs and biologics that are subject to NDA and BLA review based on data in the application demonstrating the product is safe and effective in its proposed use(s) and that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA will also review the NDA or BLA applicant’s manufacturing process and controls to ensure they are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Finally, the FDA will review and approve the product’s proposed labeling. As for the ANDA approval process, these “abbreviated” applications are generally not required to include pre-clinical or clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Rather, an ANDA must demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio-equivalence (the rate and extent of absorption in the body) to the innovator drug — unless a bio-equivalence waiver is granted by the FDA.
Phase 4 Clinical Trials: After a drug has been approved by the FDA, Phase 4 studies may be conducted to explore additional patient populations, compare the drug to a competitor, or to further study the risks, benefits and optimal use of a drug. These studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the NDA or BLA.
18

Post-Approval Studies Requirements under FDAAA: The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, significantly added to the FDA’s authority to require post-approval studies. Under the FDAAA, if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, they may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. If required to conduct a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in administrative action being taken by FDA, including substantial civil fines.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Authority under FDAAA: The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product when necessary to minimize known and preventable safety risks associated with the product. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on “new safety information,” including new analysis of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.
Other Issues Related to Product Safety: Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, under the FDAAA, the FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information derived from clinical trials, post-approval studies, peer-reviewed medical literature, or post-market risk identification and analysis systems data.
FDA Enforcement
The development of drug and biologic products, as well as the marketing of approved drugs and biologics, is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the FDA, including regulation of adverse event reporting, manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the product. Failure to comply with the FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs, BLAs, ANDAs or other product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. 
With respect specifically to information submitted to the FDA in support of marketing applications, the FDA, under its Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy, can significantly delay the approval of a marketing application, or seek to withdraw an approved application where it identifies fraud or discrepancies in regulatory submissions. Such actions by the FDA may significantly delay or suspend substantive scientific review of a pending application during validity assessment or remove approved products from the market until the assessment is complete and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved. In addition, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an ANDA. Under this Act, the FDA has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA, and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs. The FDA may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and/or withdraw approval of an ANDA and seek civil penalties.
Healthcare Reform
Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry, government agencies and others. Such studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing.
The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, or the Institute, a private, non-profit corporation created as a result of the PPACA, is tasked with assisting patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policy-makers in making informed health decisions. One of the Institute’s initiatives will be to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, which is defined as “research evaluating and comparing health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness, risks, and benefits of two or more medical treatments, services, and items.” It is important to note that the Institute would not be permitted to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer, however, the outcome of the Institute's initiatives could influence prescriber behavior.

Foreign Regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country/region to country/region, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also may vary, sometimes significantly, from country/region to country/region.
Under the EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure or decentralized procedure or the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicines produced by a biotechnological process. The procedure is also mandatory for new active substances which are indicated for treatment of several diseases or conditions, including cancer and orphan conditions. Companies may apply for centralized assessment if the product contains a new active substance or the product constitutes significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or the granting of authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of the EU patients. A centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states. This marketing authorization is issued in the form of a European Commission decision which is legally binding in its entirety to which it is addressed.
Directive 2004/27/EC introduced two parallel procedures to the centralized procedure to allow a product to be progressively authorized in each of the member states of the EU. They are the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition procedure applies where the product has already been authorized in a member state of the EU that will act as reference member state. The national marketing authorization granted by the reference member state forms the basis for mutual recognition in the member states chosen by the applicant. In the decentralized procedure, the product in question is not authorized in any one the EU member states. In such a situation, the applicant company will request a member state to act as the reference member state to lead the scientific assessment for the benefit/risk balance for agreement by the concerned member states. In both cases, the concerned member states have up to 90 days to accept or raise reasoned objections to the assessment made by the reference member state.
In addition, pricing and reimbursement is subject to negotiation and regulation in most countries outside the U.S. Increasingly, adoption of a new product for use in national health services is subject to health technology assessment under the national rules and regulations to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new treatment. In some countries, in order to contain health care expenditures, reference price is introduced in order for the national healthcare providers to achieve a price comparable to the reference price in the same therapeutic category. We may therefore face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.
Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
In the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It is time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking coverage from Medicare and private payers. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
The PPACA enacted significant reforms, including revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, increasing Medicaid rebates, expanding the 340B drug discount program, and making changes to affect the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or “donut hole.” In the coming years, additional significant changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs, and to the U.S. healthcare system as a whole, that may result in significantly increased demand for rebates, decreased pricing flexibility, diminished negotiating flexibility, coverage and reimbursement limitations based upon comparative and cost-effectiveness reviews, and other measures that could significantly impact the success of our products.
In many foreign markets, including the countries in the EU, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls or product coverage limitations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 235 employees (as compared to 215 employees as of December 31, 2017), 8 of whom hold an M.D. degree, and 17 of whom hold a Ph.D. degree. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on 
20

our ability to attract and retain uniquely qualified personnel. Our employees are not part of any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
Upon the closing of the Acrotech Transaction, we plan to reduce our staff by approximately 90 employees, the majority of which we expect to transition to Acrotech.
