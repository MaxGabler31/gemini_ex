Item 1.     Business.
OVERVIEW
We are a biotechnology company with a mission to cure patients of cancers, injuries, and birth defects of the gastro-intestinal tract and the airways.
We believe our technology is likely to be used to treat esophageal cancer, esophageal injuries, and birth defects in the esophagus. Additional product candidates in our pipeline may treat bronchial cancer, intestinal cancer, and colon cancer.
Our first esophageal product candidate, the BiostageTM Esophageal Implant, or BEI, was used in the first successful regeneration of the esophagus in a patient with esophageal cancer. This surgery was performed by Dr. Denis Wigle, Chair of Thoracic Surgery at the Mayo Clinic. The results were published in JTO Clinical and Research Reports in August 2021. The paper concluded that our BEI product candidate “would have considerable clinical use”. As noted in interviews that can be viewed on our website, leading surgeons at other leading hospitals have stated that they believe that our product candidate is “revolutionary” and “a breakthrough”. The BEI was previously referred to by us as the Cellspan Esophageal Implant. 
This successful first-in-human experience, plus the research we have performed on 45 pigs, led the FDA to approve our 10-patient combined phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trial. This combination trial will measure both safety and efficacy in the patient population. 
The Problem
According to the American Cancer Society, every year approximately 17,000 Americans are diagnosed with esophageal cancer and approximately 15,000 of these diagnosed patients die from it. A year after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer, 50% of the patients have died. After five years, 80% of these patients have died. According to the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, every year, there are more than 600,000 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer worldwide. 
The current treatment for patients with esophageal cancer is removal of the diseased part of the esophagus in a surgical procedure called an esophagectomy. The gap left by the removal of part of the esophagus is then repaired using one of two, difficult and expensive surgeries, both of which have significant complications. The first type of surgery is gastric pull-up. In this surgery, the patient’s stomach is reshaped into a tube and pulled up from the abdomen into the chest to connect to the top of the esophagus. With gastric pull-up, the patient no longer has a stomach with which to digest food. In the second type of surgery, termed colonic interposition, a piece of the patient’s bowel is cut out and used to bridge the gap where the diseased esophagus was removed. With colonic interposition, the patient often has insufficient intestine to digest food properly. Both surgical procedures have high rates of complications such as damage to the lungs and infections caused by leakage of stomach acids into the chest. Even with these surgical treatments, esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer.
In addition to cancer, there are other injuries to the esophagus such as fistulas (holes), injuries caused by the accidental ingestion of acids and alkalis, and birth defects. These are all difficult to treat surgically and often have significant long-term complications.
Hence, there is a huge need for a better treatment for cancer, injuries and birth defects of the esophagus.
Our Solution 
The Biostage Esophageal Implant consists of a hollow, tubular scaffold consisting of extremely thin fibers of plastic made in the shape of the esophagus. This scaffold is seeded with the patient’s own stem cells which are obtained a few weeks before surgery with a simple biopsy of fat tissue. The cells are seeded onto our scaffold and, during several days of incubation in our bioreactor, attach to and grow on and into the top 25% of the scaffold. The cell-seeded scaffold is then stitched into the patient to bridge the gap created where the surgeon removed the diseased or damaged part of the esophagus. The cells then stimulate the body’s natural wound-healing process, and the scaffold guides the growth of the new cells into a tube. After about a month, a complete biological tube has formed and after about three months, the tube will develop into a layered structure that contains the critical blood supply, muscles, and mucous-secreting glands to make a functioning esophagus. At this point, the scaffold is removed, as it is not a permanent implant. As the scaffold is removed through the mouth, it does not require a second surgery in the chest.

Our Technology Platform: How the Biostage Esophageal Implant Works
​
The bioreactor and scaffold are made in our clean-room facilities in Holliston, Massachusetts and the cell seeding is performed at the FDA-approved, clinical-grade human cell culture facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
Advantages of the Biostage Esophageal Implant
Compared with the current standard of care for esophageal cancer patients (either gastric pull-up or colonic interposition), the Biostage Esophageal Implant offers the following major advantages:

● | The Biostage Esophageal Implant does not require the sacrifice of the patient’s stomach or colon.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Patients do not suffer the frequently life-threatening complications of either gastric pull up or colonic interposition surgery; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Patients can eat a reasonable diet.
--+------------------------------------


● | The Biostage Esophageal Implant leaves no plastic permanently implanted in the body.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Other plastic implants such as hernia meshes and breast implants have caused considerable long-term complications for some patients, including needing to have the implants removed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The Biostage Esophageal Implant leaves no sutures where the two ends of the esophagus join together.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The suture line is a frequent cause of leaks in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

After the scaffold is removed, which typically occurs at about three months from surgery, however, it can be removed earlier if the doctors have the justification, there is nothing left inside except the patient’s own esophagus which has been regrown, as a result of the

Biostage Esophageal Implant. In our pig studies, the scaffold was removed at approximately three weeks subsequent to surgery. The scaffold in our first-in-human study, completed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic, was removed at the three-month mark. 
We believe that these significant medical advantages will lead to strong demand from patients and doctors for the Biostage Esophageal Implant and strong reimbursement from insurers because they will be able to save considerable money by avoiding the complications associated with the current surgeries.
Scientific Proof of Esophageal Regeneration
The photographs below, taken from the paper published in August 2021 in JTO Clinical and Research Reports, show the explanted esophagus from the first human patient at the Mayo Clinic. The image on the left is the actual esophagus. Note that the implant zone is visually almost identical to the area both above and below the implant zone which is the native esophagus. The thickness, color and texture of the regenerated esophagus is almost indistinguishable from the native esophagus.

The dark-brown tube in the center of the esophagus is the stent that was added to avoid narrowing of the esophagus which is a common complication of surgery in the esophagus. 
The images on the righthand side are photographs taken under a microscope to show, from left to right, cells (stained pink), layered structure (stained blue and purple) and muscles (stained yellow). The consistency of the regenerated esophagus with the native esophagus, both to the naked eye and under the microscope, is remarkable. The yellowish coloration along the left side of the right-most panel of images shows a continuous line of muscles running up the regenerated esophagus. These muscles are the muscularis mucosae which contract to eject mucous into the esophagus. This mucosal lining is essential to the long-term survival of the patient because it both lubricates the esophagus to allow food to be swallowed and provides a barrier to infection. This mucosal lining was seen at three months in the human patient and the pigs. One of the secondary performance endpoints in the clinical trial is the development of this mucosal lining by twelve months. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is the development of a continuous biological conduit (tube) by three months. We saw this tube at one month in this human patient and the pigs.
The image below is taken from a paper we published in Nature Partner Journals Regenerative Medicine in January 2022, in conjunction with our long-time partner is pediatric conditions, Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. Connecticut Children’s Medical Center is an investor in the Company.

This image shows an esophagus explanted from a pig 90 days after the Biostage Esophageal Implant was implanted. The implant zone is almost visually identical to the native tissue to the left and right of it. We can note the regeneration of the interior surface of the esophagus and the surrounding tissue that is visible in red at the top of the red box. The red color of the surrounding tissue indicates the presence of a healthy blood supply. We note further the glossy, reflective coating on the inside of the esophagus. This is evidence of the mucosal lining which is essential to the long-term survival of the patient. This mucosal lining was seen at 90 days in the pigs and was also observed in the human patient.
The authors of this paper remarked that at one year “it was difficult to distinguish neo-tissue versus the native tissue”.
First-In-Human Use of the Biostage Esophageal Implant
On August 7, 2017, we announced the use of the Biostage Esophageal Implant in a patient at the Mayo Clinic via an FDA-approved single-use expanded access, or compassionate use, application. The patient was a 75-year-old male with a life-threatening cancerous mass in his chest that spanned his heart, a lung, and his esophagus. The surgery was performed in May 2017 to remove the tumor, repair the heart, part of one lung, and a section of the esophagus. The Biostage Esophageal Implant was interpositioned into the gap in the esophagus created by the removal of the tumor. The patient’s surgeon informed us at that time that the surgery was a success, and the patient was later discharged from the hospital. In February 2018 the surgeon informed us that the patient had died after living approximately eight months after surgery. The surgeon stated that the cause of death was a stroke, and that the stroke was unrelated to the esophageal implant. The surgeon also informed us that a preliminary autopsy had shown that the esophageal implant resulted in a regenerated esophageal tube in the patient, except for a very small (approximately 5mm) hole outside the implant zone on the lateral wall that was right up against a synthetic graft inserted as part of the patient’s heart repair on the vena cava in that same surgery. The synthetic graft on the pericardium was not related to our esophageal implant product candidate and may have acted as an irritant to esophageal tissue where it contacted the esophageal implant. The surgeon also informed us that the esophageal regeneration in this patient was consistent with the regeneration previously observed in our pig studies. 
Our product candidates are currently in development and have not yet received regulatory approval for sale anywhere in the world.
Birth Defects in the Esophagus
Each year, it is estimated that approximately 1,000 children in the United States, or U.S., are born with a congenital abnormality known as esophageal atresia, a condition where an infant is born with an esophagus that does not extend completely from the mouth to the stomach. When a long segment of the esophagus is lacking, the current standard of care is a series of surgical procedures where surgical sutures are applied to both ends of the esophagus in an attempt to stretch them and pull them together so they can be connected at a later date. This process can take weeks and the procedure is plagued by serious complications and may carry high rates of failure. Such an approach also requires, in time, at least two separate surgical interventions. Other options include the use of the child’s stomach or intestine that would be pulled up into the chest to allow a connection to the mouth. We are working to develop a Biostage Esophageal Implant solution to address the complications of esophageal atresia, that could potentially be life-changing, organ-sparing, or both.
In January 2022, we published, in collaboration with Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, our research on 15 piglets that received the Biostage Esophageal Implant. This paper was published in Nature Partner Journals Regenerative Medicine. The piglets showed regeneration of a conduit, or tube, by one month and the regeneration of a normal mucosal lining by three months. The piglets showed normal growth and weight gain. This research also developed novel post-surgical techniques that closely mimic the hospital care that human babies undergo. These techniques included non-invasive CT imaging of the regenerated tissue (which, in adults, would 

4



normally be achieved with invasive biopsies that are very difficult to perform in babies) and feeding the piglets via G tubes which are normally used to feed human babies after surgeries in the gastro-intestinal tract. This study lays both the scientific and clinical groundwork for treating babies with birth defects in the esophagus with the Biostage Esophageal Implant. The FDA approval for the clinical trial allows us to treat babies once we have established safety in adult patients.
Orphan Drug Designation – Seven Years of Exclusivity
In November 2016, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation for the Biostage Esophageal Implant by the FDA to restore the structure and function of the esophagus subsequent to esophageal damage due to cancer, injury or congenital abnormalities. Orphan Drug Designation provides a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition in the U.S. from the date of a product’s approval for marketing. This exclusivity would be in addition to any exclusivity we may obtain from our patents. Additionally, orphan designation provides certain incentives, including tax credits and a waiver of the Biologics License Application, or BLA, fee. We also plan to apply for Orphan Drug Designation for the Biostage Esophageal Implant in Europe. Orphan Drug Designation in Europe would pr
ovide market exclusivity in Europe for a period of ten years from the date of the product’s approval for marketing.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy to accomplish our mission of curing patients of cancers, and other severe conditions, of the gastro-intestinal tract and the airways, includes:
Targeting life-threatening medical conditions. We are focused on creating products to help physicians treat life-threatening conditions to the esophagus, central lung and trachea caused by cancer, injury, or infection. We are also developing products for the treatment of birth defects of the esophagus and airways. We are not targeting less severe conditions that have reasonable existing treatment options such as the regeneration of skin or cartilage. Solutions for life-threatening medical conditions present a favorable therapeutic index, or risk/benefit relationship, by providing the opportunity of a significant medical benefit for patients who have poor or no treatment alternatives. We believe that products targeting life-threatening medical conditions may be eligible for review and approval by regulatory authorities under established expedited review programs, which may result in savings of time in the regulatory approval process. Also, we believe that products targeting life-threatening medical conditions may be more likely to receive favorable reimbursement compared with treatments for less critical medical conditions.
Developing products that have a relatively short time to market. Since the number of patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. with a life-threatening esophageal condition that would require a short segment esophageal implant following clinically indicated short segment resection of the thoracic esophagus is relatively small, we expect the number of patients that we would likely need to enroll in a clinical trial will also be relatively small. Ten patients will be enrolled in our first clinical trial, which implies a relatively fast enrollment time, subject to milestone achievement requirements on initial patient(s) imposed by the FDA prior to enrolling additional patients, and a less expensive clinical development program. Therefore, we expect to be able to conduct a clinical trial in a relatively short period of time, subject to enrollment time constraints, compared to clinical trials in indications with larger patient populations. We intend to work closely with regulatory agencies and clinical experts to design and size the clinical studies appropriately based on the specific conditions our product candidates are intended to treat.
Using our platform technology to address multiple organs. We believe that the clinical and pre-clinical data we have produced suggest that our technology is a novel and innovative approach to restoring organ function that may provide an ability to develop products that would address life-threatening conditions in the esophagus, bronchus and trachea, and perhaps lower portions of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract such as the intestine and colon. We believe that our technology may allow physicians to treat certain life-threatening conditions in ways not currently possible, and in some combination, to save patients’ lives, avoid or reduce complications experienced in the current standard of care, and improve the patients’ quality of life, while at the same time reducing the overall cost of patient care to the healthcare system.
Collaborating with leading medical and research institutions. We have and will continue to collaborate with leading medical and research institutions. We have a co-development initiative with Mayo Clinic for regenerative medicine organ implant product candidates for the esophagus and airways based on our technology. We are also collaborating with Connecticut Children’s Medical Center on a co-development project to translate our technology for pediatric esophageal atresia from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials. We believe the use of our product candidates by leading surgeons and institutions will increase the likelihood that other surgeons and institutions will use our products.

Our Technology
Biocompatible Scaffold Component
Our proprietary biocompatible scaffold component of the Biostage Esophageal Implant is constructed primarily of extremely thin polyurethane fibers. This material was chosen based on extensive testing of various materials. The scaffold is made using a manufacturing process known as electrospinning. The combination of the electrospinning process, which provides control over the desired microstructure of the scaffold fabric, with the polyurethane results in a scaffold that we believe has favorable biocompatibility characteristics.
The Patient’s Cells
The cells we seed onto the scaffold are obtained from the patient’s adipose tissue, or abdominal fat. This fat tissue is obtained from a standard biopsy during the weeks leading up to the implant surgery. Mesenchymal stromal cells are extracted and isolated from the adipose tissue biopsy. The isolated cells are then expanded, or grown, for a short period prior to surgery in order to derive a sufficient cell population to be seeded on the scaffold. The cells are then seeded on the scaffold in our proprietary bioreactor and incubated there before the implant surgery.
Our technology is protected by seven issued U.S. patents (including patents on the bioreactor, the structure of the scaffold and the retrievable nature of the scaffold), two Orphan-Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, both of which confer seven years of exclusivity in addition to protection offered by the patents, and our first-mover advantage which allows us to improve the standard of care. Potential competitors would now have to improve upon our new standard of care rather than just improve on the existing standard of care in order to get their product candidates approved by the FDA. In addition, our patent claims cover patches as well as tubular structures. We intend to develop patches for the repair of tubular organs as well as solid organs.
See the “Intellectual Property, Licenses and Related Agreements” section below for more details.
Unmet Patient Needs and Biostage’s Solutions
Targetted Diseases
According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, International Agency for Research on Cancer’s Global Cancer Observatory database, worldwide there were over 600,000 cases of esophageal cancer in 2020. There are over one million cases of colon cancer. In addition, there are approximately 22,000 cases of bronchus cancer that, based on conversations with surgeons, we believe could be treated with our technology. The following are the approximate case counts by certain geographic region pertaining to the cancers noted below:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------+---+-------------------------+---+---------+---+---------+---+---------+---+---------+---+----------
​ | | Case Count by Geography
Cancer Type | | USA | | China | | Japan | | Europe | | ROW | | Worldwide
Esophageal | ​ | 18,309 | ​ | 324,422 | ​ | 26,262 | | 52,993 | ​ | 182,114 | ​ | 604,100 
Colon | ​ | 101,809 | ​ | 306,078 | ​ | 96,781 | ​ | 325,335 | ​ | 318,512 | ​ | 1,148,515
Treatable Bronchus | ​ | 2,279 | ​ | 8,156 | ​ | 507 | | 4,775 | ​ | 6,351 | ​ | 22,068 
Total | ​ | 122,397 | ​ | 638,656 | ​ | 123,550 | | 383,103 | ​ | 506,977 | ​ | 1,774,683

​
These numbers of patients do not include those with fistulas, ulcers, injuries or birth defects, all of which we believe may be treatable with our technology. 
Because our product candidates are likely to save or extend lives, improve the quality of life, and save money by reducing the complications associated with current surgical repair techniques, we expect to charge more than $250,000 per product in the U.S. market. 
Treating even one tenth of only those patients who are diagnosed with esophageal cancer each year could generate billions of dollars in annual revenue. We believe that the market potential for our products is significantly higher than this.

Esophageal Disease
Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, there are approximately 17,000 new diagnoses of esophageal cancer in the U.S. each year, and there are more than 15,000 deaths. Typically, a year after diagnosis with esophageal cancer, 50% of the patients are dead and after 5 years, 80% are dead.
There are approximately 600,000 new diagnoses of esophageal cancer globally each year, according to the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer.
Hence, there is a vast need for a better treatment for esophageal cancer.
Approximately 5,000 esophagectomy surgeries occur in the U.S. annually to treat esophageal cancer, and approximately 10,000 esophagectomies occur in Europe annually. We believe that approximately one half of the world’s esophageal cancer cases occur in China, which would represent the largest potential patient population for our adult esophageal product candidate. We believe that our Biostage Esophageal Implant, if approved, has the potential to provide a major advance over the current esophagectomy procedures for addressing esophageal disease, which have high complication and morbidity rates.
We believe that our Biostage Esophageal Implant has the potential to provide physicians a new, simpler procedure to restore organ function while significantly reducing complication and morbidity rates compared with the current standard of care, and without creating significant quality of life issues for patients.
Pediatric Esophageal Atresia
Esophageal Atresia, or EA, is a rare congenital abnormality in which an infant is born without part of the esophagus. About 1 in 4,000 infants in the U.S. is born with EA. In some cases, the two sections can be connected surgically. However, in cases where the gap is too great for a simple surgical reconnection, the current standard of care is a gastric pull-up, a colon interposition, or a procedure known as the Foker process. In the Foker process, traction devices are surgically attached to the two ends of the esophagus. Traction is then applied, usually for several weeks during which time the infant remains in an Intensive Care Unit, to stimulate the ends of the esophagus to grow and narrow the gap. If the Foker process is successful in narrowing the gap sufficiently, a second surgery is necessary to connect the two ends of the esophagus. In addition to the Foker process being complex, it is also a very expensive procedure because the infant will normally be in the hospital for several months during the process.
We believe that a pediatric Biostage Esophageal Implant may provide pediatric surgeons with a better procedure to treat EA that would result in a connected esophagus with higher success rates, lower complications, and lower overall costs to the healthcare system.
Colon Cancer
Based on input from our Scientific Advisory Board, which includes some of the leading surgeons and in the field of regenerative medicine, we are planning to research regenerating other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract such as the stomach, intestine and colon. All these organs require replacement when they are damaged by cancer, injury, and birth defects. There are over one million patients diagnosed with colon cancer every year.
Central Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer and the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. There are more than 700,000 new lung cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. and Europe. In approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases, the cancerous tumor resides only in a bronchus and not in the lobes of the lungs and is known as central lung cancer. Approximately 33,000 central lung cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. and Europe are Stage I and II and are considered eligible for surgical resection, often with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Approximately 5,000 of those patients are treated via pneumonectomy, a surgical procedure involving the resection of the cancer tumor, the whole bronchus below the tumor and the entire lung to which it is connected. It is a complex surgery and, due to the removal of a lung, results in a 50% reduction in the patient’s respiratory capacity. The procedure has reported rates of post-surgical, or in hospital, mortality of 8% to 15%. Complication rates associated with pneumonectomy are reported as high as 50%, and include post-operative pneumonia, supraventricular arrhythmias, and anastomotic leakage, placing patients at significant mortality risk post-discharge.

Using a cell-seeded scaffold, which we call the Biostage Bronchial Implant, or BBI, we have performed the repair of a bronchus that was surgically removed from a pig. The bronchus regenerated, much as in the esophagus, first forming a tube and later developing into a bronchus with a functional lining known as the respiratory epithelium. The respiratory epithelium was seen in about two months in the pig. This respiratory epithelium is essential to the avoidance of infections such as pneumonia. This pig lived almost two years until scheduled euthanasia. Hence, we intend to develop the Biostage Bronchial Implant to treat bronchial cancer, bronchial fistulas or holes, and birth defects in the bronchus. Based on discussions with suregons in the field, we estimate that approximately 7,000 of these conditions in the U.S. and Europe would be potentially treatable with our technology.
We believe that a Biostage Bronchial Implant, or BBI, once developed and approved for marketing, has the potential to provide physicians a treatment alternative superior to the pneumonectomy procedure to treat central lung cancer, a simpler procedure to restore organ function of the bronchus without sacrificing one of the patient’s lungs, which we believe will result in fewer post-surgery complications, improved mortality rates and improved quality of life for the patient.
Life-threatening conditions of the Trachea
There are approximately 8,000 patients per year in the U.S. and Europe who suffer from a condition of the trachea that put the patient at high risk of death. These conditions can be due to tracheal trauma, tracheal stenosis or trachea cancer. There are approximately 40,000 tracheal trauma patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. Of those, approximately 1,000 are severe enough to need surgical resection procedures. Tracheal stenosis is a rare complication from tracheostomies but may have a devastating impact on respiratory function for patients. Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with stenosis from tracheostomy in the U.S. each year. Trachea cancer is a very rare but extremely deadly cancer. Trachea cancer patients in the U.S. have a median survival of 10 months from diagnosis and a 5-year survival of only 27%. There were approximately 200 cases of primary trachea cancer diagnosed in the U.S. in 2013. Based on these facts, we estimate that there are approximately 8,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with conditions of the trachea that put them at high risk of death, but for whom there is currently no clinically effective tracheal implant or replacement method currently available.
We believe that a Biostage Tracheal Implant, or BTI, may provide physicians a treatment to re-establish the structural integrity and function of a damaged or diseased trachea to address life-threatening conditions due to tracheal trauma, stenosis, cancer, or birth defects.
We have not performed regeneration of a trachea using a BTI. However, based on the regeneration observed in the bronchus, we believe that regeneration of the trachea may be possible.
Our History
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 3, 2012 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harvard Bioscience, Inc., or Harvard Bioscience, to provide a means for separating its regenerative medicine business from its other businesses. Harvard Bioscience decided to separate its regenerative medicine business into our company, a separate corporate entity, or the Separation, and it spun off its interest in our business to its stockholders in November 2013. Since the Separation we have been a separately-traded public company and Harvard Bioscience has not been a stockholder of our common stock or controlled our operations. Following the Separation, we continued to innovate our bioreactors based on our physiology expertise, we developed our materials science capabilities and we investigated and developed a synthetic tracheal scaffold. By that time, we had built and staffed cell biology laboratories at our Holliston facility, to give ourselves the ability to perform and control our scientific investigation and developments internally. At that point, we began the second phase of our company’s development.
In mid-2014, we increased the pace of our scientifically-based internal analysis and development of our first-generation tracheal implant product candidate, the HART-Trachea. From large-animal studies conducted thereafter we found that the product candidate elicited an unfavorable inflammatory response after implantation, which required additional development and testing. These requirements extended our expectations regarding our regulatory milestones, and we announced the additional testing and extended milestone expectations in January 2015. During 2015 we isolated and tested all major variables of the organ scaffold and the cell source and protocols, examining the effects of alternatives against the then-existing product approach. Through extensive in vitro preclinical studies, and small-animal and large-animal studies, we made dramatic improvements, and discovered that the mechanism of action of our current approach was very different from our hypothesis regarding that of the first-generation product candidate. Our technology uses a different scaffold material and microstructure, a different source and concentration of the patient’s cells and several other changes from our earlier trachea initiative. These changes resulted in a scaffold that was temporary and could be removed via the 

8



mouth in an endoscopic procedure that did not require major surgery in the chest. The temporary nature of the scaffold reduces the risk of long-term complications that can arise from permanent implants such as those from hernia meshes and breast implants.
Clinical Trials
The FDA has approved our first clinical trial.
Based on both the successful human experience at the Mayo Clinic, and our extensive large-animal research (we have performed surgeries on 45 pigs including for both adult and pediatric diseases), the FDA has approved our clinical trial. The trial will be a 10-patient combined phase 1 and phase 2 trial that measures both the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in the patient population. This clinical trial is for any patient that requires removal of a part of the esophagus that is less than 6cm long for any reason. The primary endpoint in the trial is the establishment of a continuous biological neoconduit, or tube, by three months. In the human patient, this tube was seen in one month. In the pig research, we have seen the formation of a conduit by one month. One of the secondary endpoints will be the development of a mucosal lining in the esophagus by 12 months or earlier. In the one human patient treated so far, this mucosal lining was seen at three months. In the pig research, we have seen this mucosal lining in three months.
The FDA approval for our clinical trial allows us to treat babies born without a complete esophagus once we have established safety in adults.
The Biostage Esophageal Implant will not be tested for safety on healthy volunteers (the usual goal of a phase 1 trial) or for dose-response and maximum-tolerated dose (the usual goals of a phase 2 trial). Measuring safety and efficacy in the patient population is normally the goal of a phase 3 clinical trial. Hence, our approved trial is more similar to a small phase 3 trial than a typical first clinical trial. We expect to add patients to this trial, including in Europe and China until we have sufficient data to gain approval.
Unlike the normal drug discovery process, which assesses a drug for its ability to treat a single disease, we can pursue multiple diseases with a single clinical trial. This is because any medical condition that requires the removal of part of the esophagus can be repaired with the Biostage Esophageal Implant. It does not matter that the need to surgically remove part of the esophagus is caused by esophageal cancer, Barrett esophagus (damage to the lower esophagus caused by the reflux of stomach acids into the esophagus), a fistula (a hole in the esophagus), a birth defect, or a wound or injury to the esophagus. The Biostage Esophageal Implant can be used to treat any of these conditions. Because of this, we believe that the available market in treating the esophagus to be far larger than that for treating esophageal cancer alone. In addition, we can access that large patient population without having to conduct a new clinical trial for each underlying medical condition. Compared to the development of new drugs, this greatly reduces our costs to expand the market size for our products.
We intend to request Fast Track status, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and a Priority Review Voucher from the FDA. There are many benefits of such designations, including reduced costs and faster times to market. Please refer the Regulatory Strategy section for more details.
Our first clinical trial will be in the U.S. for patients with cancer, injury, or birth defects in the esophagus. However, there are far more patients with these conditions in Europe and Asia than there are in the U.S. For this reason, we intend to expand our clinical trial to include patients in Europe and Asia and to seek regulatory approval in those countries as well.
In addition to having large patient populations, for product candidates like ours, both the European Union, or E.U., and China allow for “conditional approval”. Conditional approval is country specific but, in general, it would allow us to market our products, and obtain revenue from the sales of the respective product, after successful phase 2 results. Conditional approval is granted subject to the regulatory authority being able to rescind the approval if something goes wrong in as more patients get treated. Hence, it is possible that we could see revenue in either China or the E.U. before we see revenue in the U.S.
Research and Development
Our primary research and development activities are focused in three areas: materials science, cell biology and engineering. In materials science, we focus on designing and testing biocompatible organ scaffolds, testing the structural integrity and the cellularization capacities of the scaffolds. In cell biology, we focus on developing and testing isolation and expansion protocols, cell characterization and fate studies, investigating the effects of various cell types and concentrations, evaluating the biocompatibility of scaffolds, experimenting with different cell seeding methodologies, and developing protocols for implantation experiments. Our 

9



engineering group supports the materials science and cell biology groups across an array of their activities, i.e. designing, engineering and making our proprietary bioreactors and autoseeders. All three of our R&D groups combine to plan and execute our in vitro studies. A fundamental part of our R&D effort in developing our technology has been dedicated to the discovery and development of small and large-animal model studies. The large-animal model employs the use of Yucatan mini-pigs.
In addition to our in-house engineering and scientific development team, we collaborate with leaders in the field of regenerative medicine who are performing the fundamental research and surgeries in this field to develop and test new product candidates that will advance and improve the procedures being performed. We will work with our collaborators to further enhance our product candidates to make them more efficient and easier to use by surgeons. In the U.S., our principal collaborations have been with Mayo Clinic and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. Collaboration typically involves us developing new technologies specifically to address issues these researchers and clinicians encounter, and then working together to translate our technology from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials. In certain instances, we have entered into agreements that govern the ownership of the technologies developed in connection with these collaborations.
We incurred approximately $1.6 million and $2.1 million of research and development expenses in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As we have not yet applied for or received regulatory approval to market any clinical products, no amount of these research and development costs have been passed on to our customers.
On March 28, 2018, we were awarded a Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, grant by the Eunice Kennedy National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, or NICHD, to support testing of pediatric version of the Biostage Esophageal Implant. The award for Phase I provided for the reimbursement of approximately $0.2 million of qualified research and development costs which was received and recognized as grant income during 2018.
On October 26, 2018, we were awarded the Phase II Fast-Track SBIR grant from the Eunice Kennedy NICHD grant aggregating $1.1 million to support development, testing, and translation to the clinic through September 2019 and represented years one and two of the Phase II portion of the award. On August 3, 2020, we were awarded a third year of the Phase II grant totaling $0.5 million for support of development, testing, and translation to the clinic covering qualified expenses incurred from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020. In September of 2020, we filed and were granted a one year, no-cost extension for the Phase II grant period extending through September 30, 2021.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $165 thousand and $447 thousand of grant income, respectively, from Phase II of the SBIR grant. The aggregate SBIR grant to date provides us with a total award of $1.8 million, of which, approximately $1.5 million has been recognized through December 31, 2021.
The Phase II portion of the award expired effective September 30, 2021.
The research conducted under this grant led to the publication on the regeneration of the esophagus in piglets that was published in January 2022 in collaboration with Connecticut Children’s Medical Center.
Manufacturing and Resources
The bioreactor and scaffold are made in our clean-room facilities in Holliston, Massachusetts and the cell seeding is currently performed at the FDA-approved clinical-grade human cell culture facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
Our manufacturing process for the bioreactors and scaffolds has been approved by the FDA for the clinical trial. Additional development is likely to be necessary for product approval.
For our scaffolds, our primary materials are medical-grade plastic resins and solvents used to liquefy the resins in our manufacturing process. These materials are readily available from a variety of suppliers and do not currently represent a large proportion of our total costs. For our autoseeders and bioreactors, we perform final assembly and testing of components that we buy from third parties like machine shops, parts distributors, molding facilities and printed circuit board manufacturers. These manufacturing operations are performed primarily at our Holliston, Massachusetts headquarters.

Sales and Marketing
We expect that most surgeries using the Biostage Esophageal Implant will be performed at a relatively small number of major hospitals in the U.S., China and in the European Union. In addition, our technology platform is initially aimed at treating the esophagus, the bronchi, and the trachea, all of which are treated by thoracic surgeons. As a result, we expect to employ only a small sales force as compared to companies selling treatments for larger patient populations. 
We expect to price the product commensurate with the medical value created for the patient and the costs avoided with the use of our product. Because our products are likely to save or extend lives, improve the quality of life, and save money by reducing the complications associated with current surgical repair techniques, we expect to charge more than $250,000 per product in the U.S. 
We further expect to be paid by the hospital that buys the product from us. Finally, we expect that the hospital would seek reimbursement from payers for the entire transplant procedure, including the use of our products.
Intellectual Property, Licenses, and Related Agreements
We have seven issued U.S. patents that cover the bioreactor, the scaffold, and the surgical procedure. These patents include the claim of having a removable scaffold. The patent claims cover the use of synthetic scaffolds for any use in the gastro-intestinal tract and the airways. The patent claims cover patches as well as tubes. We intend to research the patch-based approach to treat damage to solid organs. We also have two issued patents in China and there are numerous other filings pending. These patents should provide protection into the mid to late 2030s.
Sublicense Agreement with Harvard Bioscience
We own the right to use the brand name “Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology” in the medical sciences field under a license agreement with Harvard University via a sublicense from Harvard Bioscience. Harvard Bioscience’s right to use the name arises from a license agreement, effective December 19th, 2002, between it and the President and Fellows of Harvard University. Harvard Bioscience began at Harvard University in 1903 as Harvard Apparatus and has a license to the name Harvard Apparatus in research and industrial fields. Our right to use the names in the medical field arises from the sublicense signed when Biostage, Inc. (then known as Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology) was separated from Harvard Bioscience in 2013 (as more fully described below). Harvard Bioscience delegated its right to use the name in the medical field to us and Harvard Bioscience has no right to use the Harvard mark in the medical field. We intend to use this brand name on our products in the future. We do not have the right to use the Harvard or Harvard Apparatus marks alone but only as Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology. We believe we are the only licensee of the Harvard name in the medical products’ field. This license is perpetual, worldwide and royalty-free. There are restrictions on our use of the name such as not using it in the color crimson and not using it in a serifed font. We currently have no affiliation with Harvard University.
Separation Agreements with Harvard Bioscience
On November 1, 2013, to effect the Separation, Harvard Bioscience distributed all of the shares of our common stock to the Harvard Bioscience stockholders, or the Distribution. Prior to the Distribution, Harvard Bioscience contributed the assets of its regenerative medicine business, and approximately $15 million in cash, to our company to fund our operations following the Distribution.
In connection with the Separation and immediately prior to the Distribution, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, Product Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, and Sublicense Agreement with Harvard Bioscience to effect the Separation and Distribution and provide a framework for our relationship with Harvard Bioscience after the Separation. These agreements govern the current relationships among us and Harvard Bioscience and provided for the allocation among us and Harvard Bioscience of Harvard Bioscience’s assets, liabilities, and obligations (including employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to the Separation.
Government Regulation
Any product that we may develop based on our technology, and any other clinical products that we may develop, will be subject to considerable regulation by governments. We were informed by the FDA that the Biostage Esophageal Implant would be regulated under the BLA pathway in the U.S., and we were informed by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that the previous generation 

11



tracheal product would be regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, or ATMP, pathway in the E.U. On October 18, 2016, we also received written confirmation from FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, that the FDA intends to regulate the Biostage Esophageal Implant as a combination product under the primary jurisdiction of CBER. We further understand that CBER may choose to consult or collaborate with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic scaffold component of our product based on CBER’s determination of need for such assistance.
Regulatory Strategy
Domestic Regulation of Our Products and Business
The testing, manufacturing, and potential labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, importing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and its implementing regulations, regulates biologics and medical device products.
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceuticals, or biologics and medical devices also must be in compliance with the FDA and U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Further, we are required to meet regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S., which can change rapidly with relatively short notice.
We have been informed by the FDA that our Biostage Esophageal Implant is a combination biologic/device products. Biological products must satisfy the requirements of the Public Health Services Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and their implementing regulations. In order for a biologic product to be legally marketed in the U.S., the product must have a BLA approved by the FDA.
The BLA Approval Process
The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biopharmaceutical, or biologic product in the U.S. include:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product, extensive pre-clinical information, reports of the outcomes of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s acceptance of the BLA for filing;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review or by the advisory committee, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | FDA approval of the BLA.
--+-------------------------

Based on discussions with the FDA, we expect clinical trials for our esophageal implant product candidates to be conducted in two sequential phases:

● | An initial trial that combines both phase 1 and phase 2 into a single trial. This trial has already been approved by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If successful, the initial trial would be followed by a phase 2 Registration, or Pivotal Trial, to test the product candidate’s safety and efficacy in a larger patient population. We believe that the nature of the Biostage Esophageal Implant and the sizes of their targeted patient populations would lead to a small number of patients in this trial, relative to most biotechnology clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical trials that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval.
Companies also may seek Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation for their products. Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy products are those that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a condition. If awarded, the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation applies to the product only for the indication for which the designation was received.
If the FDA determines after review of preliminary clinical data submitted by the sponsor that a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy product may be effective, it may begin review of portions of a BLA before the sponsor submits the complete BLA, or rolling review, thereby accelerating the date on which review of a portion of the BLA can begin. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be granted Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation. And even if they are designated as Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy products, we cannot ensure our product candidates will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously for their Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy indications than would otherwise have been the case or will be approved promptly, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA can revoke Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation at any time.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive Accelerated Approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-approval clinical trials to verify and further define the product’s clinical benefit and safety profile. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will receive Accelerated Approval. Even if Accelerated Approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw such approval if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-approval clinical trials, or if the post-approval clinical trials fail to confirm the early benefits seen during the Accelerated Approval Process.
Priority Review Voucher
Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation and Accelerated Approval should be distinguished from Priority Review designation although product candidates awarded Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation may also be eligible for Priority Review designation.
Product candidates regulated by the CBER may receive Priority Review designation if they provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. The agency has agreed to the performance goal of reviewing product candidates awarded Priority Review designation within six months, whereas product candidates under standard review receive a ten-month target. The review process, however, can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. Priority Review 

13



designation is requested at the time the BLA is submitted, and the FDA makes a decision as part of the agency’s review of the application for filing.
Separately, but somewhat related, is a product’s ability to qualify its sponsor to receive a Priority Review Voucher, or PRV. For a product aimed at prevention or treatment of a “rare pediatric disease” as defined in the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, and that also meets certain other qualifying attributes, the product’s sponsor may qualify, apply for and receive a PRV, from the FDA. A PRV entitles its holder to Priority Review for a drug application, and the PRV is transferable. Some companies who have received PRV’s have sold their PRV’s to other companies who have then used the PRV to receive Priority Review for a drug application with the FDA. Recent transfers of PRV’s from one company to another have occurred at prices in the $80 – 125 million range. We intend to apply for rare pediatric disease designation, such as birth defects in the esophagus, for our pediatric esophageal implant product candidate as a first step in pursuit of a PRV. A PRV is earned only upon marketing approval of the product. There is no certainty that our pediatric esophageal product candidates will achieve marketing approval from the FDA, or that if it does, that FDA would award us a PRV. Further, if received, there is no certainty that the value of a PRV at that future date will compare favorably with the values reflected in recent transfers of PRVs.
Orphan Drug Designations
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs and biologics for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. at the time of application for Orphan Drug Designation. In September 2014 the FDA granted orphan designation to our HART-Trachea product in the U.S. In November 2016, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation for the Biostage Esophageal Implant by the FDA to restore the structure and function of the esophagus subsequent to esophageal damage due to injury, birth defects, or cancer. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan biologic is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product. The marketing exclusivity prevents FDA approval of another application for the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years. Orphan status also entitles the product’s sponsor to certain other benefits, such as a waiver of the BLA user fee, which is currently a $2 million value. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
International
We plan to seek required regulatory approvals and comply with extensive regulations governing product safety, quality, manufacturing and reimbursement processes in order to market our products in other major foreign markets. 
In addition to having large patient populations, both the E.U. and China allow for “conditional approval” for product candidates like ours. Conditional approval is country specific but, in general, it would allow us to market our products, and obtain revenue from the sales of them, after successful phase 2 results. Conditional approval is granted subject to the regulatory authority being able to rescind the approval if something goes wrong in as more patients get treated. Hence, it is possible that we could see revenue in either China or the E.U. before we see revenue in the U.S.
The regulation of our products in the Asian and European markets, and in other foreign markets varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. The classification of the particular products and related approval or CE marking procedures can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals or to CE mark our products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S., and requirements for approval may differ from the FDA requirements. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other jurisdictions, including the E.U. The orphan legislation in the E.U. is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons. The marketing exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. We intend to apply for orphan drug-designation for our Biostage Esophageal Implant in Europe.
We have also formed a subsidiary in Hong Kong, Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology Limited, as we continue to assess the market and regulatory approval pathway in China as to our product candidates. We have other subsidiaries in the U.K. and Germany. We are not certain at this time as to which market, including U.S. or China for example, may provide the most viable initial pathway for regulatory approval to a commercial product. This will depend on a number of factors, including the approval and development 

14



processes, related costs, ability to raise capital and the terms and conditions thereof, as well as the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors. Any development and capital raising efforts in China may include a joint venture in relation to our Hong Kong subsidiary, and would also involve a number of commercial variables, including rights and obligations pertaining to licensing, development and financing, among others. Our failure to receive or obtain such clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all, whether that be in the U.S., China or otherwise, would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 7 employees working in our business, of whom 6 were full-time and one was part-time. At that date, all of our employees were based in the U.S. None of our employees are unionized. In general, we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our employees are highly skilled, and many hold advanced degrees. Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key scientific, technical and senior management personnel and our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We have taken proactive steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of our employees. We expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions, in compliance with all appropriate government regulations, that we determine to be in the best interest of our employees.
Competition
We are not aware of any companies whose products are directly competitive with our cell-seeded biocompatible synthetic scaffold system. However, in our key markets we may in the future compete with multiple pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, including, among others, Aldagen, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Athersys, Caladrius Biosciences, Cytori Therapeutics, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Humacyte, InVivo Therapeutics, Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Mesoblast, Miromatrix Medical, Nanofiber Solutions, Neuralstem, Orgagen, Organogenesis, Organovo, Osiris Therapeutics, Pluristem, Smiths Medical, Tissue Genesis, Inc., Tissue Growth Technologies, United Therapeutics, Vericel Corporation and W.L. Gore and Associates. In addition, there are many academic and clinical centers that are developing regenerative technologies that may one day become competitors of ours.
Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources than we do. We cannot forecast if or when these or other companies may develop competitive products.
We expect that other products will compete with our products and potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. While we believe that these will be the primary competitive factors, other factors include, in certain instances, obtaining marketing exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, availability of supply, manufacturing, marketing and sales expertise and capability, and reimbursement coverage.
