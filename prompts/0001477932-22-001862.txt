On November 19, 2021, AMPG entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Spectrum Semiconductor Materials Inc. (“SSM”), a globally authorized distributor of integrated circuit (IC) packaging and lids for semiconductor device assembly, prototyping, testing, and production requirements founded in 1990 and headquarter in San Jose, CA, pursuant to which AMPG acquired substantially all of the assets of the Company (the Acquisition). The Acquisition was completed on December 15, 2021.

In 2021, the Company opened a monolithic microwave integrated circuits (“MMIC”) chip design center in Texas and has started to implement several of its proprietary amplifier designs into MMIC components. MMICs are semiconductor chips used in high-frequency communications applications. MMICs are widely desired for power amplification solutions to service emerging technologies, such as phased array antennas and quantum computing. MMICs carry a smaller footprint enabling them to be incorporated into a broader array of systems while reducing costs.

We purchase a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings, pre-plated metals and electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by our operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times. However, recent cost inflation and potential supply chain disruptions resulting from the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher material costs in fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to our ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals used in our products.

Our operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws and substantial related regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers; and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations.

There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements nor competitive positions as a result of these environmental regulations.

Our mission is to patent our proprietary IP and trade secrets that were used in small volume niche markets and expand our capabilities through strategic partnerships, joint ventures, mergers/acquisitions with key industry leaders in the 5G/6G, quantum computing, and cybersecurity markets. We believe this will enable us to scale up our products and revenue by developing full systems and subsystems with our unique technology as a core component, which we expect will position us as a global leader in these rapidly emerging technology sectors and addresses large volume markets as well, such as cellphone handsets, laptops, server networks, and many other applications that improve everyday quality of life.

The Company’s research and development initiative to expand its product line of low noise amplifiers to include its new 5G and wireless infrastructure products and MMIC designs is progressing significantly. Our combined engineering and manufacturing resources are expected to complement the development of new subsystems for satellite, wireless, and 5G infrastructures, as well as advanced military and commercial markets.

Our Corporate History and Structure

AmpliTech Group Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. On August 13, 2012, the Company acquired AmpliTech Inc., by issuing 833,750 shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of AmpliTech Inc. in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of AmpliTech Inc. (the “Share Exchange”). After the Share Exchange, the selling shareholders owned 60,000 shares of the outstanding 893,750 shares of Company common stock, resulting in a change in control. Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which AmpliTech, Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the operations of the Company were consolidated for accounting purposes. The capital balances have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse acquisition.

On September 12, 2019, AmpliTech Group Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets of Specialty Microwave Corporation, a privately held company based in Ronkonkoma, NY. The purchase included all inventory, orders, customers, property and equipment, and goodwill. Following the closing of the asset purchase, we hired all eight team members of SMW. In connection with the acquisition, the Company began using the trade name “Specialty Microwave”. The total consideration paid was $1,143,633, consisting of $668,633 in cash and a $475,000 promissory note with an interest rate of 6%. The Company also entered a five-year lease on the property located at 120 Raynor Avenue, Ronkonkoma, NY, with an option to buy the property during the first two years of the lease for $1,200,000 and then at fair market value for the remainder of the lease term. 

On February 17, 2021, AmpliTech Group Inc.’s common stock and warrants commenced trading on NASDAQ under the symbols “AMPG” and “AMPGW,” respectively. A reverse split of the outstanding common stock at a 1-for-20 ratio became effective February 17, 2021, as of 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time. All share amounts have been retroactively re-stated to reflect the reverse split.

On November 19, 2021, AmpliTech Group, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with SSM, pursuant to which AmpliTech would acquire substantially all of the assets of SSM. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $10,123,276, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. $665,200 of the aggregate purchase price was paid by the issuance of 188,442 unregistered shares of AmpliTech common stock at the closing of the acquisition. The Acquisition was completed on December 15, 2021.

The COVID-19 Pandemic

The global health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and its resurgences has and may continue to negatively impact global economic activity, which, despite progress in vaccination efforts, remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In addition, variants of COVID-19, including Delta and Omicron, continue to emerge, the impact of which cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19 variants along with the response by governmental bodies and regulators. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Many countries around the world have continued to impose quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. Accordingly, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and manufacturing disruptions, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and on our business operations. Although we expect the vaccinations for COVID-19 will continue to improve conditions, the ultimate impact from COVID-19 on our business operations and financial results will depend on, among other things, the ultimate severity and scope of the pandemic, including the new variants of the virus, the pace at which governmental and private travel restrictions and public concerns about public gatherings will ease, the rate at which historically large increases in unemployment rates will decrease, if at all, and whether, and the speed with which, the economy recovers. We are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our business, but developments related to COVID-19 may impact our ability to meet customer demand and thus materially affect financial condition and results of operations in future periods.

IC Packaging

IC packaging is the case or enclosure that contains the semiconductor device, protecting it from corrosion or physical damage. The IC packaging also supports the electrical contacts, which connect the semiconductor device to a circuit board. IC packaging often gets sealed with lids, which creates an airtight seal to prevent contaminants, particles, liquids, or gases from entering the packaging to ensure the proper operation of the device. The Company offers multiple IC packaging and lids product lines according to desired product specifications, device performance, dimensions, resistances, and tolerances.

Our Technology
