Description of the Business



Greenrose, through its operating subsidiaries Theraplant and True Harvest, is engaged in the manufacture and processing of cannabis in the adult-use and medical cannabis marketplace in Connecticut and Arizona. Greenrose owns and operates cannabis businesses or has management or consulting services or other agreements to assist in operations with licensed operators. In addition, as a core part of our strategy, we expect to vertically integrate in the states where we operate by adding retail stores in each of the states where we currently operate.



Greenrose is focused on providing access to the quality cannabis and cannabinoid-based products at competitive pricing through state-of-the-art cultivation and processing facilities and customer engagement channels, in store, online and at home. The Greenrose team believes that a “cultivation led” vertically integrated approach will bring enhanced operating performance to our shareholders while also bringing the best value to consumers. We believe that our cultivation expertise is a key competitive advantage in every state we operate in. Our initial operational strategy revolves around five primary areas of focus:



(1) cultivation & genetics;



(2) retail & distribution;



(3) manufacturing & processing;



(4) wholesale; and



(5) proprietary data and insights.



While we focus on these five areas, we have determined that we have just one reportable business segment: the production and sale of cannabis products.





1







Greenrose governs its businesses in two operating regions with a team of functional experts at the corporate level that support local operators in the execution of their vertically integrated businesses. This will include cultivation expertise to leverage best practices in phenotyping and strain development across the organization. The focus is on indoor, growth methodology and technology deployment, with state-of-the-art control and monitoring systems. Additionally, Greenrose will focus on retail, including customer experience to reinforce brand and product adoption.



Cultivation & Genetics:



Consistently selecting and growing high-quality cannabis is one of the most important aspects of our business. In general, cannabis cultivation takes place in three settings: indoor, outdoor and in greenhouses. While it is cost effective to grow cannabis outdoors, it is hard to control pest infestations without the use of significant amounts of pesticides, and it is subject to other risks such as severe weather, disease and mold. As a result, cannabis grown outdoors is significantly lower in quality than cannabis grown indoors or in greenhouses. Our focus is growing the highest quality medicinal and adult-use cannabis. We therefore currently grow all of our cannabis in indoor facilities, which allows us to grow under ideal climate conditions and better manage key variables to deliver optimal yielding plants. New strain development and phenotyping operations are in place across our platform, enabling Greenrose companies to identify the differentiated offerings to drive downstream production and consumer offerings. Our cultivation teams leverage retail and market data to identify future trends that need to be supported back up the value chain. We will invest regularly to maintain, and where possible, to expand our high performing facilities, leveraging growth techniques and technology across our platform.



As of December 31, 2021, Greenrose has 49,500 square feet of canopy for cannabis cultivation, with an additional 14,000 added in the first half of January. Greenrose has current expansion projects underway to add an additional 24,500 square feet of canopy for cannabis cultivation.



Employees and Human Capital



The Greenrose Holding Company Inc., the parent holding company, currently has six employees based in its Amityville, New York offices, including five executive officers. Greenrose anticipates adding additional compensation arrangements including employee stock, and short-term incentive plans. The incentive plans will be subject to approval by the Company’s board of directors with input from the Compensation Committee of the board. We offer a comprehensive package of company-sponsored benefits to our team. Benefits include medical, dental and vision plans.




Greenrose prides itself on providing quality and professionalism at all levels of its business while producing the highest quality products at competitive prices. Greenrose’s human capital includes highly trained employees with extensive experience in this industry and a wide knowledge of our products and strains at all locations and operating companies. Greenrose encourages talented people from all backgrounds to join our operating companies. We believe in building diverse teams and strive to make Greenrose a welcoming space where everyone can make an impact on the Company’s success.



Theraplant has over 100 personnel licensed to work in the facility, comprised of employees, security and other contractors. There are 91 full time employees, with an average tenure of 2.8 years, and an average supervisor tenure of 5 years. The workforce is 40% female and about 20% minority. A detailed employee handbook and training program ensures smooth onboarding for all new hires. All full-time employees are eligible for health benefits after a 90-day waiting period. These benefits include medical, vision, and accident coverage.



True Harvest has 90 personnel licensed to work in the facility, comprised of employees and contractors. Following the asset purchase on December 31, 2021, the prior senior management team did not continue on and we are in the process of aligning staff numbers and positions with anticipated growth in an effort to effectively manage human capital. Detailed handbook and training programs are offered. Medical, dental and vision benefits are offered to all full-time new hires. At both Theraplant and True Harvest we offer employees the opportunity to grow and develop their careers. They are provided with comprehensive benefits and compensation packages which we believe are competitive relative to our peers in the industry.

Recent Developments 



Going Concern



We currently have projected negative cash flows until recreational cannabis is sold legally within the state of Connecticut. Based on the current debt and interest obligations coupled with a working capital deficit of $103,434 thousand, we do not currently have sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to meet our obligations through the twelve months following the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Management believes it is taking all prudent actions to address the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, but we cannot assert that it is probable that our plans will fully mitigate the liquidity challenges we face. Management believes it is taking all prudent actions to address the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, but we cannot assert that it is probable that our plans will fully mitigate the liquidity challenges we face. Therefore, this condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.



Management’s plans to continue to evaluate different strategies to obtain the required funding of future operations. These plans may include, but are not limited to additional amendments to or waivers of default, additional funding from current or new investors, reduction in expenses, and operational and revenue improvement . We are currently in active discussions with the lenders under our credit agreements (including certain of our related parties) for additional financing, a waiver of our compliance with covenants in and events of default under the credit agreements; however, if we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital needs, we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of operations and/or limit or cease operations. The negative cash flows and lack of financial resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, and that substantial doubt has not currently been alleviated through management’s plan.



The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in their normal course of business. There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.



Exchange of Sponsor Promissory Notes for Greenrose Common Stock 



On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with the Company’s Sponsor to convert $2,640,500 in aggregate principal amount of promissory notes and convertible notes (the “Sponsor Notes”) into (i) 685,289 shares of common stock of the Company, par value of $0.0001 per share, and (ii) 1,892,500 non-callable private warrants entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at $11.50 per share for five (5) years from the date of issuance. The Sponsor Notes were non-interest bearing and did not contain a stated maturity date. The non-callable private warrants contained the same terms and conditions as the private warrants issued to the Company’s Sponsor and the Company’s underwriters in connection with its February 11, 2020 initial public offering.



Simultaneously with the entry of the Exchange Agreement, Greenrose issued all 685,289 shares of common stock of the Company to the Sponsor in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon the issuance of the 685,289 shares of common stock and 1,892,500 warrants of the Company, the Sponsor Notes were cancelled and are no longer outstanding.



The terms and conditions of the conversion of the Sponsor Notes into shares of common stock and Private Warrants of the Company, including the conversion price, were approved at a meeting of a special committee of the independent members of the board of directors of the Company, in which members of the board of directors who were also members of the Sponsor were recused.

THERAPLANT



General



Theraplant is a well-established seed-to-wholesale cultivator, extractor, and processor that produces high quality cannabis products. Located in the limited license state of Connecticut, Theraplant has captured a significant portion of Connecticut’s medical cannabis market and is poised to capitalize on the projected $250 million adult-use cannabis market beginning in year 1 projected to increase to $725 million in year 4, according to MJBiz. Connecticut’s adult recreational use legislation was signed into law and became legal on July 1, 2021 and we currently expect the cannabis market to open for recreational some time in 2022. We anticipate that we can capitalize on dispensaries’ need to build inventory ahead of the opening of the recreational market. Led by cannabis industry veterans, Theraplant maintains profitability while complying with Connecticut’s rigorous medical program regulations.



Theraplant has been cultivating, processing and packaging medical cannabis and derivative products since 2014. Theraplant was recognized by the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection as the highest scoring license applicant, and in February 2014, was awarded the first of only four cultivation licenses in the state.



In September 2014, Theraplant was the first cultivator/producer to supply state-licensed dispensaries with medical cannabis products and the sole source of supply in Connecticut for the first five months after medical legalization.



Theraplant is run by a team of business and cannabis experts. Dan Emmans has designed and/or built over 1 million square feet of cultivation, processing and retail facilities. He has 11+ years’ experience in the legal cannabis market around the country. Jennifer Mandzuk has implemented many of Theraplant’s growth generating platforms. Collectively the team has demonstrated significant annual cultivation yield increases, from 350 pounds in 2015, to 1,000 pounds in 2016, to 4,000 pounds in 2017, to 6,000 pounds in 2018, to 14,000 pounds in 2019, 12,000 pounds in 2020, due to a fire in the first quarter of 2020, and over 14,500 pounds in 2021. These gains came from careful optimization of cannabis strain production, facility expansions, enhanced cultivation technologies, efficient manufacturing operations and business positioning.



Connecticut Cannabis Market



Connecticut has fostered a successful medical marijuana program that now includes over 53,000 registered patients and over 1,200 registered physicians with, according to a July 22, 2021 article in Forbes Magazine, sales of $143 million in 2020. There are currently 39 qualifying conditions for adults and 11 for patients under 18. The state currently has 18 licensed medical marijuana dispensaries and four licensed medical cultivation and processing facilities (including three other MSO’s: Curaleaf in Simsbury, CT, Pharma/Tuatara in Rocky Hill, CT, and Advanced Grow Labs/Green Thumb Industries in West Haven, CT.



On June 22, 2021, Governor Ned Lamont signed Connecticut Senate Bill 1201, An Act Concerning Responsible And Equitable Regulation Of Adult-Use Cannabis, thereby legalizing adult-use recreational cannabis use in Connecticut. Anticipated revenues from combined medical and recreational adult sales could generate $250 million in the first full year.



Cultivation& Genetics





Theraplant has been a leader in Connecticut cultivation since its initial opening. Following its recently completed expansion of 30,000 square feet, the first quarter of 2022, Theraplant’s operations now span 98,000 square feet with a current production capacity of nearly 40,000 pounds, which may be less based upon the number and type of strains in production. Situated on 10 acres, there is ample opportunity for expansion up to 500,000 square feet to meet future demand. Theraplant currently maintains a genetics library of over 300 in-house variants, with 30 strains in regular production and 15 strains in seasonal rotation. Theraplant employs an experienced R&D team, where Theraplant’s breeding program is regularly developing new strains to meet evolving customer tastes and preferences, and to improve production efficiencies. New equipment is tested and built to support research and development initiatives. The team has demonstrated key competencies in marrying strains with high yield, high THC, and short growth cycles, and optimizing strain production to ensure high-yield, resilient genetics.





7







Manufacturing& Processing




Cutting-edge processing operations have propelled Theraplant to meet all USP111/Pharmacopoeia quality standards and passing all finished product tests since inception. Rebranding in 2019 and 2020 demonstrates Theraplant’s commitment to providing elevated customer experiences and evolving to meet customers’ shifting demands. Such initiatives have helped increase brand awareness in Connecticut.. At any given time, the production operations have over 100 SKUs on the Theraplant production menu, with about one week testing turnaround for flower, and about two weeks turnaround for extracts. Theraplant’s size and streamlined operations have historically allowed, and we expect it to continue, its products to remain competitively priced, while still maintaining profitability.



Theraplant’s state-of-the-art facilities are based in Watertown, Connecticut. Theraplant employs quality equipment sourced from known suppliers in the cannabis equipment industry. Carbon dioxide or ethanol extraction is followed by a series of proprietary refining processes yielding oils and concentrates ranging from soft-and-buttery, to sap-like and brittle. Highly refined concentrates test between 75% to 95% THC. There are dedicated functional spaces for each processing and postprocessing stage: extraction, filtration/distillation/formulation, in-process storage, packaging, and finished goods vaults. Reclamation and distillation processes are utilized to minimize waste and maximize return.



Our quality control process helps to make sure that our products meet applicable standards. We believe we have a best-in-class compliance department with nine full-time employees dedicated to ensuring regulatory and quality compliance. The quality control process is compliant with state and local regulations. Quality and safety of products are tested at third-party labs in Connecticut, which have found no deficiencies since Theraplant’s inception. Our products consistently exceed state testing and certification requirements.



We believe Theraplant operates a safe and secure facility. Physical operations are secured and monitored continuously by third party licensed security guards and state-of-the-art video monitoring systems. Only authorized personnel with appropriate clearances have access to Theraplant’s facilities using card and bio-metric controls. Theraplant engages third party legal, environmental health and safety advisors to assist in maintaining appropriate procedural, educational and training programs for its employees.



Wholesale& Distribution



Theraplant sells and delivers products directly to dispensaries throughout Connecticut. We believe its operational efficiencies have yielded wholesale price competitiveness and profitability. Supported by upstream efficiencies in the supply chain including manufacturing optimization and automation, Theraplant serves dispensary customers and clients by providing what we believe to be premium, high-quality products at a lower price point than competitors. We believe attractive price points retain customers and grow shelf space. Theraplant’s purpose-built infrastructure ensures Theraplant manages production processes from start to finish, maintaining and tracking inventory from seed to distribution using its own proprietary system.



Theraplant has established relationships with all third-party Connecticut dispensaries, enabling dispensaries to place orders online 24/7. Theraplant’s focus on inventory management and distribution are syndicated: Theraplant’s proprietary inventory management system provides real-time menu updates and advanced analytics capabilities that assist in data-driven decision making and to better predict demand.



Theraplant owns four delivery vehicles, which allow substantial control over distribution, timing and compliance with state regulations with an average of two to three deliveries per dispensary per week, inventory is often 100% sold through at the dispensaries before next delivery, with average order size steadily growing. Delivery vehicles are driven by what we believe to be reputable, licensed, third-party security providers.



Cash management practices are approved and audited by Theraplant’s current banking institutions.





8







Operational Systems



Theraplant has well established proprietary operating systems. Theraplant has developed systems that enable it to provide high quality products and services at a lower cost. In its cultivation facilities, these systems include irrigation, rolling tables, specific nutrient schedules, efficient manicuring, and trellising for plant support. These systems include efficient facility design, seed to sale tracking software, and RFID tagging. Detailed systems for receiving and sending products through our inventory management operating systems and specific documentation regarding policies, procedures, consumer education, employee education, compliance regulations, and security, is provided by extensive training and manuals onsite.
Intellectual Property (IP)



Theraplant has intellectual property that gives it an advantage over our competitors. Intellectual property includes proprietary data with respect to plant genetics, production facility design, proprietarily designed HVAC systems, environmental conditioning including but not limited to nutrient/feeding schedules, extensive knowledge of strains for breeding, and specific manicuring techniques to increase yield and potency.
Competition



Theraplant is one of only four legal cannabis cultivators in Connecticut. Although we have a strong operating history in the state’s medical cannabis market, and we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in Connecticut’s newly established recreational cannabis market, we will face significant competition from Theraplant’s competitors in Connecticut. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to the Business Combinations, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively in Connecticut’s cannabis market.
TRUE HARVEST



General



True Harvest is a cultivation services business operating under license from a third-party Arizona licensed cannabis operator. True Harvest grows, processes, packages and sells cannabis under the Shango Fine Cannabis brand to approximately 60% of the existing retail stores and medical dispensaries in Arizona.



True Harvest was initially established in May 2015, completing construction on its initial grow facility in October 2015. True Harvest operates within 74,000 square feet of the former Revlon manufacturing facility at 4301 West Buckeye Road, Phoenix, Arizona. This facility, built in the late 1960s, in the aggregate exceeds 800,000 square feet. True Harvest is one of the largest indoor grow operators in the state. The space occupied by True Harvest includes industrial sized water treatment, power and cooling infrastructure with seven flower rooms, three vegetation rooms, one mother room and one clone room. An eighth flower room is in the process of being added, and a ninth and tenth flower room are in the planning stage. Cooling capacity allows for substantial growth and reduction of risk during the summer season. True Harvest has the potential to expand its cultivation footprint at the 4301 West Buckeye Road facility.



The business operates with 50 strains in its library and with more than 20 in current rotation. The operations are managed through an agreement with Gary P. Rexroad, a Shango executive with deep cannabis cultivation operations experience. Rexroad, together with True Harvest staff, manage all aspects of operations at the True Harvest site, including genetic selection to planting, harvesting, production, packaging and distribution. The relationship with Rexroad brings market leading expertise to the True Harvest team and its customer base and the ability to sell its cannabis under the well-known premium cannabis brand, Shango Fine Cannabis.



True Harvest’s largest customers are public multi-state cannabis operators (“MSO’s): Curaleaf, Cresco Labs and Harvest Health. As one of the first wholesale operations in Arizona, True Harvest has developed long standing relationships with dispensaries throughout the state. Same day delivery allows True Harvest to capitalize on market opportunities across the state. True Harvest utilizes bulk and jar-based packaging to meet dispensary requirements and to better market the Shango brand.

Current Market



The State of Arizona legalized medical marijuana in 2010, and Arizona has since issued 130 vertically integrated licenses across the state; each license includes one dispensary, one onsite grow and one off-site grow with no cap on production. The market is populated with a number of public and private MSOs as well as local operators, including Copper State Farms, the largest in the state with close to 60 acres of greenhouse grow.



Adult recreational cannabis was approved in the November 2020 elections and was implemented as of January 2021. This created an additional 130 licenses being made available to current medical license holders with certain financial considerations. The market has expanded significantly since the legalization of medical marijuana, with 2021 revenues state-wide anticipated at approximately $1.23 billion, based on tax collection estimates and a registered medical patient count of 290,075 (Q4 2021 AZDH) representing approximately 3.99% of the state’s adult population.
