We offer a fully hosted Technology Transition model designed to allow the client to bring study administration and set-up services in-house yet continue to host the solution with us, as well as a complete Technology Transfer model for clients that want to keep their eClinical technology solution completely in-house. This methodology allows our customers to use our services at their own pace, given the logistics of their human resource, infrastructure and capital constraints. This model allows us the flexibility to deliver eClinical solutions to a broader array of clinical trial sponsors.
 
Our Software Products and Services
 
TrialMaster Electronic Data Capture
 
Our core product is TrialMaster, which allows organizations conducting clinical trials to collect and manage their clinical trial data over the internet. Users at investigative sites such as hospitals and doctors’ offices can enter data into electronic forms that represent the study protocol, and the data is immediately validated against a set of protocol-specific rules. Sponsor companies and Contract Research Organizations ("CROs") can then perform various data management and monitoring functions, such as comparing the entered data against source documents at the site. When all patient data has been entered, signed and locked, the sponsor company can extract the data for final analysis and produce PDFs of the source data ready for regulatory submission and site archive.
 
While there are many EDC products on the market, OmniComm believes that the breadth of functionality, ease of use and sophistication of implementation puts TrialMaster in a very strong position. The functionality of TrialMaster includes the following:
 

● | A highly productive tool for designing trials, featuring a drag-and-drop interface; a sophisticated JavaScript-based engine for building edit checks; and a tool for configuring how the data is to be exported;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A fine-grained security model that allows appropriate privileges to be granted to each user and role;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An online eLearning system that can be used to ensure users receive the appropriate training and pass all related assessments before being allowed to perform activities in TrialMaster;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A data entry sub-system that responds at the keystroke level to guide the user to enter correct data the first time. For example, if an adverse event is marked as “continuing”, it is impossible to also enter a stop date;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to import external data through a file import utility;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Task lists and reports that support data entry and data cleaning processes, as well as adhoc reports and “data grids” that provide customizable access to the protocol-specific clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support for Risk Based Monitoring, including a sophisticated mechanism to select a subset of data for Source Document Verification, based on risk factors for both the site and the patient;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to detect Serious Adverse Events and construct Safety Cases that can subsequently be passed electronically to a full safety reporting system using the industry standard E2B message format;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to translate both the TrialMaster application and all protocol text into any number of foreign languages, such that data can be entered in one language and reviewed in another;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to allow patients to enter their own data, such as for electronic diaries, avoiding the need for a costly and separate system for electronic Patient Reported Outcomes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The ability to automatically produce data exports in the FDA-mandated SDTM format. We believe TrialMaster is the only EDC system with this capability; and 


● | Application Programing Interfaces (APIs), that allow partner software products to fetch and update data in TrialMaster. The APIs follow the Operational Data Model standard maintained by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In Q2 2018, OmniComm released version 5 of TrialMaster with a modern user interface and built-in support for mobile devices. These new features allow TrialMaster to be accessed from a web browser or a tablet such as an iPad. The patient data entry module can be accessed using a smartphone such as an iPhone. Using “liquid layout” technologies, the TrialMaster display automatically adjusts to the form factor of the device on which it is running. The adoption of version 5 has been very rapid, and a significant number of trials are already in production on this version.

TrialOne Phase I Clinic Automation
 
TrialOne is a comprehensive software application suite that provides clinical trial site sponsors, study investigators and study monitors with several tools designed to make the overall Phase I clinic operation more efficient. Phase I studies are used to conduct the first tests of new drugs or medical devices in humans. They are often held in dedicated Phase I clinics, where volunteers follow a strict timed schedule of dosing followed by measurements such as vital signs, electrocardiograms and repeated blood draws. TrialOne is designed to manage the automation of Phase I clinics. It allows the specification of the schedule and the corresponding dosing and required measurements, then supports the real-time collection of data according to that schedule. Much of the data collection is automated via direct entry from instruments (eSource), such as barcode scanners that read barcodes on both the patients and the vials of blood being filled.
 
The key components of TrialOne include:
 
Subject Recruitment and Screening
 The TrialOne subject recruitment module is designed to provide essential functionality for automating the collection and tracking of information involved in finding, screening and scheduling subject candidates for an early phase study. The customized database can be searched for volunteers based on specific demographics, medical history and concomitant medications. Trial sponsors can define study-specific screening test panels and record volunteer screening test results. Outbound communications can be managed allowing for the scheduling of calls, sending e-mail blasts, printing mailing labels or exporting flexible CSV files.
Scheduler
 The Scheduler module provides a mechanism for defining the study structure including a time and events schedule. The module is designed to optimize study build times using a wizard-driven design tool creating database efficiencies using object libraries and templates. This can quickly produce clear, easy to use, schedule driven electronic case report forms ("CRFs") suitable for complex and adaptive clinical trials including study alarms and real time validation criteria with edits. Additionally, the Scheduler can define actions or events to be automatically offset relative to the study drug and rapidly address mid-study changes.
Sample Tracking
 TrialOne allows customers to completely automate their site’s laboratory. Samples can be tracked and batched while alarms and information can be configured specific to each sample. Dispatch lists and labels are automatically produced for shipment of samples to the central laboratory. Data is then received back electronically into the TrialOne database.
Direct Data Capture (“DDC”)
The DDC module allows capture of real-time data for screening or study at data collection stations, bed-side or roaming. The system allows for the collection of data online, over an intranet or the internet using a desktop, notebook, or tablet PC. Using a library of custom drivers the DDC module can collect vital signs or other biologic data directly from devices and/or instrumentation. As with later phase applications the system can clean data at the point of collection with real-time validation edit checks while enhancing protocol compliance via schedule-driven workflows. Working with the Subject Recruitment and Screening module the system seamlessly maps data to the recruitment database for future criteria searches. Automation and authentication checks are maintained using a full array of barcode and scanner support for all aspects of the clinic including subject IDs, sample labeling and event tracking.
Ad Hoc Reporting
 An integrated Ad Hoc reporting tool is available with wizard-driven report generation with drill-down reports that include interactive charts and graphs. The Ad Hoc module supports aggregate data and advanced calculations, an advanced and easy to use export feature and distributable system reports by configurable schedules. Data is protected by event configurable security and role-based security. The Ad Hoc module allows for real-time data access to important trends such as vital signs and adverse events.
 
AutoEncoder
 
OmniComm’s AutoEncoder provides a mechanism to turn free-text descriptions of adverse events and medications into coded entries from industry-standard dictionaries, namely MedDRA® for adverse events and WHO Drug® for medications. The product includes automated selection of proposed codes based on pattern matching against verbatim terms or synonyms for those terms; automated management and use of history records to ensure coding consistency within a trial; an optional review and approval step; and the transmission of coded results back to TrialMaster where they are stored as derived data values. The majority of TrialMaster trials use AutoEncoder.
 
OmniComm’s AutoEncoder can also code terms coming from systems other than TrialMaster, as long as those terms can be provided in a simple text file. This means the AutoEncoder can be used to code terms from other EDC systems, or from safety reporting systems. It can also be used to efficiently re-code terms against newer versions of the relevant medical dictionaries. With older formats of WHO Drug no longer allowed from new drug applications, this is a valuable capability for the industry.

IRTMaster
 
IRTMaster™ is an offering from OmniComm that provides “Interactive Response Technology” in support of the randomization process in clinical trials. The product allows the setup of trial parameters, such as the different strata for the patient population, then provides sophisticated algorithms to randomize patients across the different treatment groups (such as the investigational medication and placebo). The algorithms include a minimization technique that prevents any significant imbalance across the different treatment groups. For example, in a block of ten patients where five will get the investigational medication and five will get placebo, there is a statistically significant chance that the first five patients will all get placebo; with a minimization algorithm, the chance of such an imbalance is significantly smaller.
 
IRTMaster can be used standalone through its user interface, or can interact with TrialMaster or any external system using API calls. In this mode, it can effectively be considered a “black box” application.
 
The current release of IRTMaster supports various configuration options as well as randomization and related functions, such as emergency unblinding. A release planned for the second half of 2019 will add clinical supplies tracking and thereby complete the functionality.
 
Acuity
 
OmniComm’s Acuity, our flagship analytics product, is a clinical data aggregation and analytics platform driving actionable knowledge. Acuity provides insights into quality, risk and performance of various aspects of clinical trials in real time. Acuity enables views across different types of data including clinical operations, subject data, drug supply and patient recorded outcomes. It provides an interactive view of the progress in overcoming operational challenges and analyzes scientific data at the study, country and site level – with the ability to drill down to the lowest level data point. Acuity makes it simple to compile data, generate reports and analyze multiple datasets within a study. Immediate insight and timely interventions mean last minute surprises are avoided – which improves quality and compliance. Acuity can provide data insights from various data source systems, such as EDC, CTMS, IXRS, and eCOA.
 
Acuity has the following features that enables clinical insights and risk based monitoring:
 
Insights
 Data from operational and other relevant clinical domains can be brought together to derive insights that can help managers, executives and leaders to review the progress of work at any point in time. This is achieved by converting complex data into intuitive data visualizations.
 
Risk planning
 The risk planning feature has been created in alignment with TransCelerate’s recommendation. TransCelerate BioPharma Inc. is a non-profit organization with a mission to collaborate across the global biopharmaceutical research and development community to identify, prioritize, design and facilitate implementation of solutions designed to drive the efficient, effective and high-quality delivery of new medicines. It enables risks to be created and prioritized in a study or program. These risks can be documented and assigned to different departmental leads to enable collaboration and develop holistic risk mitigation through an integrated quality risk management plan (IQRMP).
 
Decision Factory
 The decision factory feature allows risk indicators to be created and data imported in monthly batches to review the risk at sites that enables decision making on varying the Source document verification and on site monitoring level based on the risk level of the sites.
Action Center
 The action center is an important workflow component that helps in documenting issues and raising action items. This feature also allows action item to be assigned to different stakeholders. This is imperative when central data review and monitoring are performed which will have all the action items recorded and viewed on one place
Legacy Products
 OmniComm provides two legacy products that have active support-paying customers, but are no longer being actively marketed.
 
The eClinical Suite provides a set of tools for collecting and managing clinical data, including EDC for real-time entry and double data entry ("DDE") for entry from paper originals. It also provides a central system for clinical trials management and another for adverse event reporting. OmniComm has announced the end of support for the eClinical Suite to be April 30, 2019.
Promasys is a clinical trial data management system for both DDE and EDC that is primarily used at research institutions for investigator-initiated trials. It includes an iPad module for convenient data capture within the clinic and a separate electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) module.

Market Opportunity
 
Clinical trials are a critical component in bringing a drug or medical device to market.All prescription drug and medical device therapies must undergo extensive testing as part of the regulatory approval process. We believe many clinical trials continue to be conducted in an antiquated manner and fail to optimize the resources available for a successful clinical trial. We believe that our solutions significantly reduce costs, improve data quality and expedite results. We believe the data integrity, system reliability, management control and auditable quality of our eClinical Solutions will aid clinical trial sponsors that want to improve clinical trial efficiencies, speed-up results and ensure regulatory compliance.
 
We believe that success in the EDC market is predicated on several criteria. As the industry grows and matures the ability of participants to fulfill the varied needs of clinical trial sponsors becomes more critical to achieving operational and financial success. We believe these success criteria include:
 

● | Deployment options. Successful EDC vendors provide clinical trial sponsors with flexibility in choosing whether to deploy EDC on an ASP, Technology Transfer or Technology Transition basis. The ultimate criteria for the selection of the type of technology delivery methodology is often predicated on the size and the resources of the clinical trial sponsor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interoperability. Most clinical trial sponsors have invested in other technology platforms to run their trials. These include clinical data management systems, interactive voice response systems and central labs. The ability for an eClinical solution to integrate with existing technology platforms is a key decision making factor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability. The ability to scale the eClinical solutions to absorb additional projects seamlessly is important to trial sponsors. Scalable solutions will retain their speed and performance metrics as projects and engagements increase in size.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Migration from hosted to technology transfer solutions. When clinical trial sponsors decide to bring the eClinical services and solutions in-house it is vital that they do not experience a degradation of speed, performance or system reliability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flexibility. The more robust eClinical systems will be designed to provide the ability to increase functionality and guarantee interoperability with other industry technology solutions. As the industry and technology matures clinical trial sponsors will demand new functionality without loss of performance or reliability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company spent $3,370,233 which represents 12.4% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 and $2,854,428 which represents 10.6% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 on product development initiatives. The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement and redesign of our eClinical Solutions to keep our technology at the cutting edge in the markets in which we compete.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our efforts to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. We have registered trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad, and have filed applications for the registration of additional trademarks and service marks. Our principal trademarks are “OmniComm Systems,” “TrialMaster,” “TrialBuilder,” “TrialExplorer,” OmniCloud,” “Promasys” and “TrialOne.” These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. Our agreements with employees, consultants and others who participate in development activities could be breached. However, due to rapid technological change, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments and enhancements to existing products and services are more important than the various legal protections of our technology to establish and maintain a technology leadership position.
 
We currently hold several domain names, including the domain names “omnicomm.com,” “promasyssoftware.nl,” “promasyssoftware.com” and “trialmaster.com.” Additionally, legislative proposals have been made by the U.S. federal government that would afford broad protection to owners of databases of information. The protection of databases already exists in the European Union. The adoption of legislation protecting database owners could have a material adverse effect on our business, requiring us to develop additional, complex data protection features for our software products.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. Any failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
 
In addition, since the software and Internet-based industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights it also involves frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We, and other companies in our industry, have entered into a settlement and obtained a license from a patent holder (DataSci, LLC) to license third-party technology and other intellectual property rights that are incorporated into some elements of our services and solutions. Our technologies may not be able to withstand third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, could divert management attention from executing our business plan or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial position. There is no assurance that we will not become subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. An adverse determination on such a claim would increase our costs and could also prevent us from offering our technologies and services to others.
 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, technology or copyrighted material, to third parties. We generally provide in our customer agreements that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our technology provided to the customer.
 
Competition
 
The market for EDC, eClinical, data management and interactive response technology systems is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete with systems and paper-based processes utilized by existing or prospective customers, as well as other commercial vendors of EDC and eClinical applications, clinical data management systems and adverse event reporting software, including:

● | systems developed internally by existing or prospective customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vendors of EDC, eClinical, clinical trial management systems and adverse event reporting product suites, including Oracle Corporation and Medidata Solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vendors of stand-alone EDC, data management and adverse event reporting products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CROs with internally developed EDC, clinical data management systems or adverse event reporting systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, customer support and service delivery. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | product functionality and breadth of integration among the EDC, eClinical and interactive response technology solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reputation and financial stability of the vendor;
--+--------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
The conduct of clinical trials is subject to regulation and regulatory guidance associated with the approval of new drugs, biological products and medical devices imposed upon the clinical trial process by the U.S. federal government and related regulatory authorities such as the FDA and by foreign governments. Use of our software products, services and hosted solutions by entities engaged in clinical trials must be done in a manner that is compliant with these regulations and regulatory guidance. Failure to do so could have an adverse impact on a clinical trial sponsor’s ability to obtain regulatory approval of new drugs, biological products or medical devices. If our product and service offerings fail to allow our customers and potential customers to operate in a manner that is compliant with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, clinical trial sponsors and other entities conducting clinical research may be unwilling to use our software products, services and hosted solutions. Accordingly, we design our product and service offerings to allow our customers and potential customers to operate in a manner that is compliant with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance. We also expend considerable time and effort monitoring regulatory developments that could impact the use of our products and services by our customers and use this information in designing or modifying our product and service offerings.
 
The following is an overview of some of the regulations that our customers and potential customers are required to comply with in the conduct of clinical trials.
 
The clinical testing of drugs, biologics and medical devices is subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities worldwide. The use of software during the clinical trial process must adhere to the regulations and regulatory guidance known as Good Clinical Practices, other various codified FDA regulations, the Consolidated Guidance for Industry from the International Conference on Harmonization regarding Good Clinical Practice for Europe, Japan and the United States and other guidance documents. Our products, services and hosted solutions are developed using our domain expertise and are designed to allow compliance with applicable rules or regulations.
 
In addition to the aforementioned regulations and regulatory guidance, the FDA has developed regulations and regulatory guidance concerning electronic records and electronic signatures. The regulations, codified as 21 CFR Part 11, are interpreted for clinical trials in a guidance document titled Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations. This regulatory guidance stipulates that computerized systems used to capture or manage clinical trial data must meet certain standards for attributability, accuracy, retrievability, completeness, originality, traceability, inspectability, validity, security and dependability. Other guidance documents have been issued that also help in the interpretation of 21 CFR Part 11.
 
Regulation of the use and disclosure of personal medical information is complex and growing. Federal legislation in the United States, known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes a number of requirements on the use and disclosure of "protected health information" which is individually identifiable, including standards for the use and disclosure by the health care facilities and providers who are involved in clinical trials. HIPAA also imposes on these healthcare facilities and providers standards to assure the confidentiality of health information stored or processed electronically, including a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures. This may affect us in several ways. Many users of our products and services are directly regulated under HIPAA and, to the extent our products cannot be utilized in a manner that is consistent with the users' HIPAA compliance requirements, our products will likely not be selected. In addition, we may be directly affected by HIPAA and similar state, federal and foreign privacy laws. Under HIPAA, to the extent we perform functions or activities on behalf of customers that are directly regulated by such medical privacy laws, such customers may be required to obtain satisfactory assurance, in the form of a written agreement that we will comply with a number of the same HIPAA requirements.
 
In addition, we are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business through the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy and data protection, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions and securities law compliance.
