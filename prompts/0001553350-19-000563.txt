ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
History
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (the "Company or MediXall) was incorporated on December 21, 1998 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of IP Gate, Inc. The Company had various name changes since, to reflect changes in the Companys operating strategies. 
Business Overview
 
MediXall is a technology and innovation-driven organization that has developed a new generation healthcare marketplace platform to address the growing need of self-pay and high deductible consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. The cloud-based MediXall.com platform connects patients with high-quality healthcare providers and wellness services. The Companys targeted marketplace is Florida, with plans for a nationwide roll-out. Further discussion on our operations, mission, and initiatives can be found in the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of this report. 

MediXall seeks to revolutionize the medical industry by improving communication; providing better technology and support services; and enabling more efficient, cost-effective healthcare for the consumer. By approaching the healthcare ecosystem as a whole, MediXall seeks to create, invest and incubate companies that embody its mission statement. 

MediXall has 2 distinct divisions:

1.
 MediXall.com, the Healthcare Ecosystem, and
 2.
 MediXall Finance Group, a strategic alliance of financing specialists that create funding opportunities for healthcare practice growth and expansion, as well as financing for medical procedures and accounts receivable lines of credit.

The Healthcare EcoSystem 

MediXalls mission for its Healthcare EcoSystem is to create a dynamic distribution platform that attracts and supports new generations of healthcare technologies and services, delivering innovative solutions that help our Provider Network clients optimize their financial and operational performance. Management has developed three strategic initiatives for its Healthcare EcoSystem - the Network, the Marketplace, and the Strategic Partner Ecosystem - to identify opportunities in the market and seamlessly integrate innovative solutions that will benefit MediXall, our clients, and the healthcare industry as a whole. 
Strategic Initiative 1: Build a Robust Healthcare Provider Network

Since inception, MediXalls first strategic initiative was centered around building a robust MediXall Provider Network of Healthcare Providers, which include licensed and certified diagnostic centers, medical service providers, medical product providers and physician practices. The MediXall Provider Network continues to gain significant traction in South Florida, and the Companys network growth has accelerated over the past few months, now surpassing 5,500 healthcare providers registered in its Early Adopter Program. 

To facilitate the development of the MediXall Provider Network, MediXall entered into a new partnership with CoreChoice, Inc., the nations leading specialty network for diagnostic radiology, neurodiagnostic testing, and interventional pain management. This partnership will result in one of the nations largest networks of affordable, high quality radiology providers and facilities for the self-pay underinsured market offering consumers across the country an unprecedented opportunity to compare most diagnostic/imaging services based on all-in cash price, location/distance, ratings, & availability, and select the best value according to personal preferences. With this, MediXall will now have access to over 22,000 fully-credentialed radiology providers and facilities across all 50 states. From an operational standpoint, management believes this partnership accelerates the development of MediXall Provider Network by 2 to 3 years, as we continue to drive expansion in Florida and begin our nationwide roll-out. 

Management believes that building the MediXall Provider Network is key to expanding MediXalls reach, as it creates access to a growing network of credentialed service providers, fully vetted suppliers, medical facilities and diagnostic centers.

This affords MediXalls portfolio of products and services the opportunity to become the preferred resource of ancillary services to healthcare providers that participate in its provider network, as well as to other healthcare providers, physician groups, testing facilities, nursing homes and hospitals. Furthermore, MediXalls integrated network of providers will offer leverage to substantially accelerate distribution for future products and services that MediXall brings to market. In order to have a strong launch of the MediXall Platform and good momentum during the early quarters, MediXall has established a marketing and sales team that will grow with the company, continue to facilitate the rapid development of a strong healthcare provider network in South Florida and further serve as a foundation for expanding the Companys reach throughout the State, and nationwide. 

Strategic Initiative 2: Develop a Central Platform Connecting Providers, Patients, and Stakeholders with Just-in-time Service Model

The second strategic initiative was to develop the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, which would act as the central portal for the MediXall Provider Network, consumer/patients, and many of the products and services we have under the MediXall Umbrella. Because of the complexity and fragmentations of the industry, online marketplaces such as WebMD have seen remarkable success within the U.S. digital healthcare market. Generally accepted as a forum with potential to reduce inefficiencies and increase transparency, the online marketplace is a free-market environment, utilizing the power of competition to empower the consumer as it reduces inefficiencies and increases transparencies. In this era of rapidly increasing deductibles and healthcare costs, the MediXall cloud-based platform is designed to be transformational and disruptive to traditional methods of medical care and provisioning of medical services to the consumer.

Our vision for the MediXall Platforms prominence in the healthcare marketplace is to create a unified online environment that connects physicians and caregivers to patients, and payers to the caregivers, across all healthcare settings. Starting with pricing transparency and leveraging the just-in-time service delivery model, we intend to expand our service offerings to enable smarter care and empower the customer/patient at virtually every point of the healthcare continuum; whether organically, through acquisitions, or through integration with our strategic partners solutions. As we expand the Healthcare EcoSystem, MediXall.com will facilitate such transformation in the future of healthcare by offering community connectivity, interoperability, data analytics, and consumer engagement features and functionality.

Strategic Initiative 3: Create Partnerships and Joint Ventures to Offer Needed Products and Services to Both Healthcare Providers and Their Customer/Patients

The third strategic initiative was to create an integrated healthcare partner ecosystem that would enhance the operations of the healthcare providers, offering patients the tools and services that would allow them to take control of their own health-care. It is Managements prime directive to provide high-quality integrated services, encompassing a broad range of functionality and information, acting as a liaison between providers, patients and payers. An outstanding ecosystem of strategic partners who extend the value of our platform in powerful ways is taking shape. These developers and partners have built healthcare apps, devices, and technology enabled services aimed at improving the quality of healthcare, empowering the patient, and lowering the cost of health delivery. In response to the enthusiastic welcome for healthcare pricing transparency from the healthcare providers that have become Early Adopters of the MediXall Provider Network so far, our team began to ask what more we could do to support our practitioners in building their practices. Many expressed a need for better access to patient information, better ways to increase attendance to appointments, and financial services to support both patient procedures and practice growth and operations. As part of our MediXall business model, we are selecting the highest quality and most effective products and services to add to our Healthcare EcoSystem that will address these needs, while at the same time help MediXall Provider Network members increase their net margins and keep more of their revenue, as well as assist in reducing their business operations burden.

Over the next year, we plan to integrate MediXall.com with our technology partners, enabled by our application programming interface, or API, through which we will grant access to approved developers and partners. We believe that the opportunities and technology provided by our partners enhance the power of our marketplace and contribute to the attractiveness and critical position of MediXall.com within the Healthcare EcoSystem.

How the MediXall Healthcare EcoSystem Works 

Our MediXall.com, along with our strategic partners and their respective products and services should create powerful network effects that benefit our entire Healthcare EcoSystem. As more local healthcare businesses adopt our platform, more provider listings appear on the MediXall.com and third-party partner sites available through the MediXall Provider Network. As awareness of these businesses increases through these marketing channels, they will attract more consumers to our platform. Those consumers then attract even more healthcare businesses to our platform. As those businesses and consumers engage in more transactions on our platform, this increases bookings and partner revenue, and enables additional revenue streams from demand generation. Finally, as we add more healthcare providers and consumers to our Healthcare EcoSystem, we attract more technology developers and strategic partners who can leverage our Provider Network and use our API to develop additional apps and services that extend the capabilities of MediXall.com.
 
Milestones

2018 accomplishments included such milestones as:

Built our Imaging Service Provider Network

We entered into a strategic partnership with CoreChoice, Inc., the nations leading specialty network for diagnostic radiology. This partnership provided the Company with access to more than 22,000 fully-credentialed radiology providers and facilities throughout all 50 states.
Reduced the Provider Acquisition Cost Model

Developed a company-wide strategy and implemented internal processes that significantly reduce the cost and time to acquire healthcare providers.

Launched MediXall.com throughout the state of Florida in September

This first controlled release is focused on imaging procedures, which includes MRI, CT, PET, X-rays, ultrasound, mammogram scans and more. Consumers will find MediXall.com simple to use, since it works much like booking a hotel or flight through Priceline or a similar online booking site, providing consumers with reviews, transparent pricing, and comparative shopping.
Entered into Strategic Partnerships to Launch New Programs in 2019 

MediXallRx

With the launch of MediXallRx in early November, MediXall.com provides a powerful, free tool to search and compare prescription drug prices, which can differ greatly between competing pharmacies, and receive immediate savings of up to 80 percent using the MediXallRx Savings Card at the register on both generic and brand prescription medications. By leveraging our partners national pharmacy network, MediXallRx is now accepted nationwide at more than 60,000 participating pharmacies throughout all 50 states, including Walgreens, CVS, Target, Walmart, and other national chains as well as regional and local drug stores. 
Laboratory Testing

In September, we entered into a partnership and negotiated pricing with a major national laboratory company that will allow the us to launch a national laboratory testing services program to MediXall.com users in 2019. This new program will provide a seamless ordering experience for patients and physicians to search, compare, and order affordable pre-curated panels or design custom lab test orders for their patients.

Created a better method for Provider/Patient Communication

MediXall.com providers expressed the need for a tool to better manage and streamline their current referral process since often patients dont follow up, follow-up appointments are missed, and the referring office staff has no way to track the referral's progress. Based on this, we updated the functionality available to those providers using MediXall.com, creating the MediXall Patient Experience.

Launched MediXall Patient Experience Portal to Physicians

Most studies show that price transparency tools have little effect on patient shopping, in part, because patients rarely use them. From ordering diagnostic tests, recommending treatments and making referrals, providers direct most of our nations healthcare spending. Given that providers treatment and referral decisions drive a vast majority of healthcare spending, we developed the MediXall Patient Experience to serve as a tool for physicians to share the cost and location of upcoming care options. This enables patients to discover locations, pricing, and availability options of which they were previously unaware. This system empowers patients to take control of their healthcare by showing options personalized for each self-pay and underinsured patient, how much it will cost, where the patient lives, and more. With the MediXall Patient Experience, we are building a platform to stand on the shoulders of our consumer facing healthcare marketplace, MediXall.com. We think that MediXall.com makes shopping for healthcare as simple and easy as booking a flight or hotel, but it needed a straight line to deliver our what you see is what you get pricing data to the right people at the right time. This is only possible by involving the patients physician as a critical partner to facilitate this price transparency.

How MediXall.com Works

MediXall.com makes shopping for specific healthcare services as simple and easy as booking a flight and hotel. The online experience was designed to mirror e-commerce and online booking sites found in other markets, with it centered on providing consumers with user reviews, transparent pricing, and comparative shopping. The website enables consumers and corporations, such as self-insured companies operating under ERISA (Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974) and private insurance companies, to search and compare most medical, dental and wellness services from Qualified and vetted providers based on all-in cash price, location/distance, ratings, & availability, and select the best value according to personal preferences. 

Consumers can find healthcare providers and book appointments in just a few easy steps:

1.
 Log onto MediXall.com 
 2.
 Select the medical, dental, or wellness service they need
 3.
 Compare providers and prices
 4.
 Book their appointments
 5.
 Payments are made when appointment is completed

Heres how providers use MediXall to transform healthcare:

1.
 List products and services. Prospective patients will visit MediXall.com search for the medical, dental, or wellness services they need.
 2.
 Get matched with patients. When a search aligns with the providers services and availability, the platform will automatically post the providers price and available appointments in search results.
 3.
 Schedule new patients. Once a patient requests the appointment with a specific provider, that provider gained a new patient. 
 4.
 Improve the practices strategy. The provider will receive a monthly report of the months activity, so that they can assess the competition and pricing strategy.

The cloud-based platform works on both mobile and desktop devices.

MEDIXALL HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE FOR CONSUMERS 

While consumers only started feeling the pinch of out of pocket expenses and woke up to health care costs a few years ago as their share began to rise, they lack the necessary facts to make intelligent decisions about the quantity and quality of what they are purchasing. As costs continue skyward, this crucial information, especially price transparency, is what consumers are now demanding, which has prompted our United States Government to get involved.

The proliferation of high deductible health plans marks the beginning of the return of the individual health care consumer. Before a patient reaches and exceeds their insurance deductible, a patient shopping for an MRI, a strep test, or just about anything else, will act just like any other customer shopping in the market for any other good or service. For any purchase before hitting the deductible, the patient is paying with their own money, and will be price sensitive, therefore willing to shop around among different providers of the same medical service.

To put the power back in the consumers hands, MediXall created the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace with a cash paying customer forefront in our design. MediXall offers two value-added services to consumers shopping for medical procedures. First, the Company works with each of the providers in the MediXall Network, so that they offer consumers a transparent all-in cash price. Second, beyond the prices, MediXall ensures that providers offer consumers details on what the listed service includes so that they pay one price and one price only, which is not always the case when dealing directly with providers.

Benefits for Consumers

·
 Find affordable medical care. Even if a consumer is uninsured or has a high deductible health plan, with MediXall consumers can save money without sacrificing quality medical care.
 ·
 Know medical costs upfront. Consumers will know the cost of your medical care before receiving the bill. That means no unwelcome surprises when it’s time to pay!
 ·
 Skip the hassle of insurance companies. When billing through insurance, consumers may have to call several times to ask about coverage, costs, and find out exactly what they’re paying for. With MediXall’s transparency, consumers will find affordable medical care without the stress of an insurance company.
 
5


·
 Receive customized offers tailored to the consumers specific needs. When a consumer submits a request for medical services, they will receive competitive offers from qualified providers who can meet their medical needs.
 ·
 Compare services, qualifications, and bids to find the best provider or facility for the consumer. Consumers don’t have to rely on any third party to choose a provider. In the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, the patient is in control.
 ·
 Book appointment with ease. With MediXall, consumers can search for doctors, dentists, and other medical/dental services; and book appointments based on cost, distance, ratings and availability at the click of a button.

MEDIXALL HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

For healthcare providers, oﬀering services to insured patients is complicated, costly and fraught with delays and providers customarily discount their services by an average of 40% as a result of the insurance companies’ bargaining positioning. Additionally, providers often must wait for months before a claim is reviewed and approved by insurance companies. Finally, providers must write oﬀ a large percentage of their billings due to unpaid co-pays, deductibles, co-insurance, disputed billing, and other situations. According to many providers, the wait time for payment from an insurance provider is 27-90 days on average from the time of service. The administrative burdens and payment delays often increase when government programs like Medicare and Medicaid are involved. 

These difficulties have led to a sharp increase of providers abandoning insurance companies in favor of cash only, concierge medicine, and other alternative business models. Many providers, however, cannot afford to completely replace their business model, which is what is often necessary to make the shift proﬁtable.

By delivering a solution that better connects consumers with high-quality healthcare providers and wellness services, MediXall enables our Provider Network members to engage consumers with the level of price transparency and digital convenience that they have come to expect in every other aspect of their lives.

Benefits to Healthcare Providers:

·
 Attract high-quality cash-paying patients. MediXall matches high-quality cash-paying patients that are well suited for a provider’s practice, while decreasing cancellation and no-show rates. With cash-paying patients, providers will get paid right away instead of having to wait for insurance companies to review and approve claims.
 ·
 Improve Consumer Experience. With MediXall, providers can engage consumers with the level of price transparency and digital convenience that they have come to expect in every other aspect of their lives.
 ·
 Reduced Overhead. MediXall’s integrated cloud-based platform for the healthcare industry helps providers simplify the way they run their businesses. With MediXall everything is automated, so providers spend less resources scheduling appointments and dealing with billing. 
 ·
 Managed for Providers. MediXall takes care of everything when it comes to growing the provider’s practice, so providers can focus on delivering exceptional patient experiences. All MediXall Provider Network members have access to a growing toolkit of support services for establishing and growing their practice.
 ·
 Risk-free Patient Acquisition. MediXall removes all the risks associated with marketing. Unlike other marketing solutions, MediXall does not charge a recurring fee for its service, providers only pay when new patients receive medical or dental care.

Market Analysis: Rising Healthcare Costs 

Healthcare spending, overall, is very high in the United States, and growing. From 2005 to 2016, health care spending in the United States tripled. In 2016, it reached nearly $3.4 trillion, up 4.8 percent from 2015. About 11% of that $3.4 trillion spent on health care was paid for directly by consumers through out-of-pocket costs, which was about $352 billion. That makes healthcare one of the countrys largest industries, equaling approximately17.8 percent of gross domestic product. In comparison, health care costs were $27.2 billion in 1960, just 5 percent of GDP. That translates to an annual health care cost of $10,348 per person in 2016 versus just $146 per person in 1960. Health care costs have risen faster than annual income. According to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), U.S. health care spending is projected to reach nearly $5.5 trillion by 2025, a full 20 percent of GDP. 

Furthermore, the average insurance premium for consumers has risen 19% over the past five years, to $7,000 for single coverage in 2017, and to nearly $19,000 for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, only 80% of health insurance premiums go towards paying for service, while the other 20% is lost in administrative overhead. Oftentimes healthcare providers go unpaid for months, or longer  causing ever increasing costs.

Despite employers paying about three quarters of their workers premiums, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, individual workers health costs have gone up as well. In addition to premium increases, their out-of-pocket costs, which include what they spend for deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, have risen too. Between 2005 and 2015 average out-of-pocket costs grew 66%, or more than twice the growth rate in wages during that period, according to Kaiser.

The Patient’s Perspective

Patients struggle to bear the high costs of health care in the United States by paying increasingly expensive insurance premiums, which can only serve as a cap on a family’s exposure to ﬁnancial ruin. Because of high annual deductibles, most patients day to day care is still paid out of pocket.

Since costs such as a doctor visits and many other routine visits are paid out of pocket, price comparison is increasingly important. Currently, consumers suffer from a lack of transparency, trust, and a general inability to systematically access the best health care at the most affordable price.

While the internet has increased the amount of information available to health care consumers, many self-pay consumer purchases are a result of chance, haphazard decision making, procrastination, and poor information. Moreover, many Healthcare Providers have not thought about what they would charge a cash-pay patient who pays up-front at the time of service. As a result, the self-pay consumer pays the health care provider at the providers Usual and Customary Rate, which on average is 40% more than what insurance companies pay for their insured members. This discount represents one of the largest advantages of the insurance model.

Prices for a given procedure vary widely, however, within a town, state, countrywithout necessarily any real difference in the quality of outcomes as well. Researchers for a Health Care Cost Institute study found the national average price for 242 common serviceseverything from lab tests and X-rays to more extensive procedures like hip replacements and angioplastiesvaried extensively across states as well as within metropolitan areas. For example, in Cleve-land, the average price paid for a pregnancy ultrasound was $522. But just 60 miles away in Canton, Ohio, the average price was $183, according to the study.

An Amino Study of MRI prices found that the price of an MRI can be thousands of dollars more if you go to a hospital than if you go to an imaging center, depending on your state. Although many qualify for subsidized insurance premiums, they are still required to pay their deductible up front. In 2015, the Affordable Care Act capped this at $6,500 for an individual and $13,200 for a family-potentially ruinous costs for many low to middle income Americans.

As a result, increasing numbers of patients go without insurance entirely, thinking their healthcare needs would not justify the expense of an insurance premium. Oliver Wyman found that enrollment in the healthcare exchanges decreased by 22 percent in 2016 and 2017. This population, often young and too well off to qualify for government-funded welfare programs like Medicaid, therefore neglect going to the doctor for routine visits. This represents a loss both for patients and providers.

The Providers Perspective

For health care providers, offering services to insured patients is complicated, costly and fraught with delays. As indicated above, providers customarily discount their services by an average of 40% as a result of the insurance companies bargaining positioning. Moreover, providers often must wait for months before a claim is reviewed and approved by insurance companies and they receive payment. Finally, providers must write off a large percentage of their billings due to unpaid co-pays, deductible, co-insurance, disputed billing, and other situations.

According to many providers, the wait time for payment from an insurance provider is 27-90 days on average from the time of service. The administrative burdens and payment delays often increase when government programs like Medicare and Medicaid are involved. Illinois, for example, has more than $5 billion dollars in unpaid state health insurance and $2 billion dollars in unpaid Medicaid bills to healthcare providers who in many cases have waited years to be reimbursed. The situation is so bad that many providers opt not to deal with Medicaid, turning away those most in need because they cannot afford to provide services for free. Approximately 50 percent of providers make this tough decision.

These administrative costs overburden providers as well as insurance companies. Approximately 80 percent of a healthcare insurance premium goes directly to medical services, on average. The remaining 20 percent goes to administrative costs of the insurance company.

These difficulties have led to a sharp increase of providers abandoning insurance companies in favor of cash only, concierge medicine, and other alternative business models. Many providers, however, cannot afford to completely replace their business model, which is what is often necessary to make the transition proﬁtable.

MediXall Healthcare Ecosystem: Finding the Right Solution for Patients and Providers


By delivering a solution that better connect consumers with high-quality healthcare providers and wellness services, MediXall enables our Provider Network members to engage consumers with the level of price transparency and digital convenience that they have come to expect in every other aspect of their lives.
Strategic Focus
 
Deployment Strategy

The rising cost of healthcare, coupled with the increased prevalence of high deductible health plans and out-of-pocket expenses, has led to concern over healthcare costs for both patients and physicians. Furthermore, cost and quality of equivalent tests and procedures tend to vary dramatically between providers. However, these discrepancies are generally not accessible to patients or physicians, especially not at the point of care.

Overall, we believe that we have found the key to scaling up transparency by (initially) targeting imaging centers as the beneficiaries of referrals. For them, MediXall.com represents a new marketing channel and much lower cost. To accomplish this, we entered into a strategic partnership with CoreChoice, Inc., the nations leading specialty network for diagnostic radiology, neurodiagnostic testing, and interventional pain management, aimed at increasing consumer access to high quality and low-cost specialty care services for the self-pay and underinsured market across the country.

Founded in 2009, CoreChoice combines the talents and expertise of medical, technology, and insurance industry professionals to provide a new level of radiology, neurodiagnostic, and interventional pain management network service. CoreChoice maintains a comprehensive network of free-standing facilities in all 50 states, the District of Colombia and Puerto Rico. Self-pay and Underinsured consumers, via MediXall.com, can now access the depth and breadth of the CoreChoice radiology network; which includes highly specialized ser-vices such as open and closed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scans, Computerized Axial Tomography (CT) Scans, Mammography, Sonography, X-Ray, Nuclear Medicine, Bone Density, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT).

With over 22,000 radiology providers and facilities in the CoreChoice network, the partner-ship will result in one of the nations largest networks of affordable, high quality providers  offering consumers an unprecedented opportunity to compare radiology service providers across the country based on a best all-in cash price, location/distance, ratings, and avail-ability, and select the best value according to personal preferences.

Working with MediXall Group, CoreChoice will offer providers in its network access to MediXall.com, a new generation healthcare marketplace platform designed to address the growing need of self-pay and underinsured consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. This will give MediXall access to fully credentialed facilities across all 50 states. Leveraging Cores robust specialty network, MediXall.com will now enable consumers to search, compare, and purchase most diagnostic/imaging services from qualified and vetted providers. As a result, the first full release focuses on five high-value radiology full diagnostics: MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, and mammogram scans, but will expand to other medical and dental specialties in the next few months.

MediXall is launching throughout the Florida region and are currently working with Core Choice to onboard their Diagnostic Radiology Centers to MediXall.com. In addition, we are working with the marketing teams of these Imaging Centers to leverage and tap into their robust Referral Networks. As we continue to build out the broader based MediXall Provider Network, the initial imaging centers on MediXall.com will allow us to rapidly acquire the patient/consumer population as users through referrals from local Primary Care and specialty Care Providers throughout Florida.

With this first release, MediXall.com will act as tool for physicians to share the cost and location of upcoming care options, enabling patients to discover locations, pricing, and availability for these options of which the doctor was unaware and utilize potentially better but certainly cheaper and more convenient options. This tool will decrease patients out-of-pocket expenses, streamline referrals, and improve patient-physician rapport by cultivating a salient dialogue about cost and value. Although competitors exist, they only offer self-service transparency tools to the patient or transaction processing to physicians and are thus massively underutilized.

Our growth strategy for MediXall.com is to expand outward from the current base of Florida to major cities with strong coverage by the Core Choice network. This allow us to accelerate expansion and fill in the provider network with minimal effort and cost, which allows us to focus our resources on Marketing to the consumer and technology development. Beyond Florida, we expect to expand to Texas, concentrating on 4 regions, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Austin and El Paso. Moreover, we anticipate expanding on a West-Southwest strategy covering New Mexico, Arizona, Washington State, Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada, as well as pick up high density areas in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Delaware, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. 

As the platform enters the marketplace, we will be looking to integrate MediXall.com with an electronic health record (EHR) platform. Such an integration will be the first of what we believe will be many such integrations of the MediXall.com to other leading EHR and medical practice management platforms. Although the MediXall.com will continue to be available as a stand-alone subscription directly via the internet, integration with other medical platforms substantially accelerates the power and effectiveness of the platform.

Onboarding and Quality Assurance

MediXall is committed to promoting the highest level of quality care for its users. In support of this commitment, practitioners who join the MediXall Provider Network must undergo a rigorous process called credentialing in order to be able to provide services through MediXall.com. 

Once a health provider has requested to join our marketplace, we conduct a full credentialing process that 
evaluates the qualifications and practice history of a health provider. Credentialing involves many steps, which ensure that providers meet our stringent standards and are capable of providing MediXall users with the quality of care they have come to expect. Once a providers participation application is received, we verify the qualifications and practice history of a health provider. This information includes, but not limited to:

·
 All medical and postgraduate training
 ·
 Board certification in the providers area of specialty
 ·
 Current licensure
 ·
 Any sanctions against the provider's license
 ·
 Malpractice coverage
 ·
 Malpractice history, work history, medical history

If the provider passes all of these checks, the application is then forwarded to the MediXall Credentialing Committee for review. This committee includes healthcare providers from our provider network, along with providers from within the community. Providers who are approved by this committee become MediXall preferred providers and can begin providing services through our Healthcare Marketplace Platform.

Credentialing is a lengthy, but necessary, process to ensure that our users have access to quality healthcare providers. We expect to be capable of providing ownership disclosure on nearly all Providers. Meanwhile, the consumer on the buying side of the transaction will be protected by their aforementioned rolling encryption, uniquely coded profile and member identification for each user. 

Sales and Marketing

We deploy a direct sales approach driven by an inside sales team based in Ft Lauderdale, Florida. Our sales team qualifies and manages prospective and current MediXall Network Providers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our platform over time. Our sales team partners with the technology team to provide consultation and product demonstration to prospects to accelerate the onboarding of new subscribers. As we begin the roll out of the MediXall.com to employers, we intend to develop and expand a field sales team responsible for discovery, qualification, and account management for larger organizations.

Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal healthcare providers and consumers. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online display and print advertising, participation in trade shows, events and conferences, permission marketing, social media and media outreach, and strategic partnerships and endorsements.

Revenue Model
 
Our revenue model is comprised of four primary components: 

Technology Fees. Revenue we expect to earn from providers for the use of the technology, once a patient requests the appointment from that specific provider. All providers pay outstanding fees on a monthly basis to MediXall. 
Subscription and Services. With the Company soft-launching MediXall.com throughout Florida, early-adopter providers can join the platform for one year at no cost. During this time, the provider is only subject to technology fees as they accrue. We are leveraging this Provider user base and associated data to refine the app, identify what works and what does not work and offer enhancements and upgrades for Subscription fees. As we begin the broader-based market rollout of the MediXall.com, we expect subscription and services revenue will be generated primarily from sales of subscriptions and additional features for the platform. We expect most of subscription fees to be prepaid by subscribers on a monthly basis via a credit card and, to a lesser extent, billed to subscribers on an annual or quarterly basis. 
Financing Revenue. We expect to earn financing revenue from revenue share arrangements with third-party payment processors and lenders on transactions between MediXall Provider Network members who utilize our financing solutions and their consumers. Financing solutions offered to the MediXall Provider Network include: 1) Patient financing for healthcare practitioners to offer their patients the option to receive care when they need it, and to make payments over time, 2) Cosmetic and elective procedure financing through practitioners, 3) Commercial financing for practice expansion, equipment purchases and leases, and 4) Medical accounts receivable financing. We expect our financing revenue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue as we add new providers who utilize our financing solutions, as existing providers and consumers increase the volume of transactions that they process through our financing solutions, and as our aggregate volume of financing transactions reduces our related costs and increases margins. 
Partner Product and Services. MediXall Provider Network members can choose to enter into a separate contract with MediXall technology partners to purchase additional features and functionalities, as well as other products and services. We receive a revenue share from these arrangements from our technology partners, which is recorded when earned. Additionally, we intend to develop the MediXall.com API, which will create a revenue stream from API platform partners for subscriber site access, data query, and consumer bookings.
