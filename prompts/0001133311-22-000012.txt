We have our finger on the pulse of outstanding travel, entertainment, and lifestyle experiences. For over 20 years we have worked in partnership with more than 5,000 top travel suppliers—our long-standing relationships give Travelzoo members access to irresistible deals. 
Travelzoo (the “Company” or "we") attracts a high-quality audience of travel enthusiasts across multiple digital platforms, including email, web, social media and mobile applications. Our insider deals and email newsletters are published by Travelzoo and its licensees worldwide. The Travelzoo website is visited by 3.4 million to 6.1 million unique visitors each month. We also reach an audience of millions of Internet users each month via the Travelzoo Network, a network of websites that syndicate our deal content including The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. We have over 3.6 million followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Our Apple and Android mobile applications have been downloaded 6.9 million times.
Our publications and products include the Travelzoo website (travelzoo.com), the Travelzoo iPhone and Android apps, the Travelzoo Top 20® email newsletter, the Newsflash email alert service, and the Travelzoo Network. Our Travelzoo website includes Local Deals and Getaways listings that allow our members to purchase vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants.
We also license the use of these products and our intellectual property in various countries in Asia Pacific, including but not limited to Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia. We are also the majority shareholder of JFC Travel Group Co. (“Jack’s Flight Club”), which operates Jack’s Flight Club, a subscription service that provides members with information about exceptional airfares. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 30.3 million members worldwide. In Europe, the unduplicated number of Travelzoo members was 8.4 million as of December 31, 2021, down 4% from December 31, 2020. In North America, the unduplicated number of Travelzoo members was 16.9 million as of December 31, 2021, up 4% from December 31, 2020. On March 15, 2021, Travelzoo added more than 2 million new members in the U.S. from a direct competitor from Europe exiting the U.S. market. Jack’s Flight Club had 1.8 million subscribers as of December 31, 2021, up 6% from December 31, 2020.
More than 5,000 companies use our services, including Air France, Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Club Med, Emirates, Etihad, Exoticca, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Gate 1 Travel, Hawaiian Airlines, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Hyatt Corporation, Icelandair, InterContinental Hotels Group, Lion World Travel, Myrtle Beach Area Conventions & Visitors Bureau, Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean, Singapore Airlines, Starwood Hotels & Resorts and United Airlines.
Revenues from the Travelzoo brand and business are generated primarily from advertising fees from two categories of revenue: Travel and Local. The “Travel” category consists of advertising or publishing revenues, primarily (a) listing fees paid by travel companies for the publishing of their offers on Travelzoo’s media properties and (b) commission from the sale of Getaways vouchers. Listing fees are based on audience reach, placement, number of listings, number of impressions, number of clicks, and actual sales. For publishing revenue, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the emails and delivery of the clicks, over the period of the placement of the advertising. For Getaways vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of the vouchers upon the sale of the vouchers. The "Local" category consists of publishing revenue for negotiated high-quality deals from local businesses, such as restaurants, spas, shows, and other activities and includes Local Deals vouchers and entertainment offers. Jack’s Flight Club revenue is generated from paid subscriptions by members. Subscription options are quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. We recognize the revenue monthly pro rata over the subscription period. The Company also has licensing arrangements with licensees in (a) Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia and (b) Japan and South Korea, in each case, where the Company is entitled to a quarterly royalty payment based on a percentage of net revenue. The Company records royalties on a one-quarter lag basis and recognized $12,000 in royalties in 2021. Under the licensing agreements, Travelzoo's existing members in the applicable territories will continue to be owned by Travelzoo as the licensor.
On April 24, 2020 and May 5, 2020, the Company received $3.1 million and $535,000, respectively, pursuant to loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the Small Business Association. In 2021, the principal and the interest of the $3.1 million PPP loan and $429,000 of the $535,000 PPP loan were forgiven and a gain was recorded in “Other income (loss), net”. The Company paid off the remaining outstanding principal balance and the interest of $111,000 for the $535,000 PPP loan.
Historically, the Company managed its business geographically and operated in three reportable segments including Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. In 2020, the Company classified the results of its Asia Pacific segment as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. On January 13, 2020, Travelzoo agreed to the Stock Purchase Agreement with the sellers of Jack’s Flight Club to purchase 60% of the outstanding shares of Jack’s Flight Club. Upon acquisition, the Company reviewed and evaluated Jack's Flight Club as a separate segment. The Company currently has three reportable operating segments: Travelzoo North America, Travelzoo Europe and Jack’s Flight Club. Travelzoo North America consists of the Company’s operations in Canada and the U.S. Travelzoo Europe consists of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Spain, and the U.K. Jack’s Flight Club consists of subscription revenue from premium members to access and receive flight deals from Jack’s Flight Club via email or via Android or Apple mobile applications. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Travelzoo North America operations were 67% of revenues, Travelzoo Europe operations were 28% of revenues and Jack’s Flight Club operations were 5% of revenues. Financial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Our principal business office is located at 590 Madison Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
Ralph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo and who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro Capital Inc. ("Azzurro"). As of December 31, 2021, Azzurro is the Company's largest stockholder, holding approximately 41% of the Company's outstanding shares. 
As of December 31, 2021, there were 12,055,762 shares of common stock outstanding. 
Travelzoo is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TZOO.” 
Our Industry 
The global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020 had unprecedented impact on the global travel and hospitality industries, including severely restricting travel, dining and activities (through border closures, quarantine and stay-at-home requirements, travel restrictions, limited operations of restaurants, spas, hotels, airlines and travel agencies), as well as the level of economic activity around the globe. According to the World Trade & Tourism Council (WTTC), the global Travel & Tourism industry produced $4.7 trillion in value for the total global economy in 2020 compared to $9.2 trillion in 2019. However, the global economy from travel and tourism in 2021 is expected to increase by $1.4 trillion based on WTTC's October 2021 report. 
As the Company and many of our advertisers are part of the global travel and hospitality industries, the measures implemented to contain COVID-19 have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our business. Many of the Company's advertising partners paused, canceled, and/or stopped advertising with the Company. Additionally, there has been a significant level of cancellations for the Company's hotel partners and travel package partners as well as refund requests for our vouchers with the Company’s hotel, restaurant and spa partners. However, we are starting to see that these trends are subsiding, as international travel begins to open up and travel in general is starting to return to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, the Company modified its policies, particularly with our vouchers, to extend expiration dates and to allow for full refundability and have received positive feedback from our members. The Company will continue to adopt new policies as the situation evolves.
Our mission is to provide our audience with the highest quality information about the best travel, entertainment and local deals. Our revenues are generated from advertising fees. According to Zenith Media's forecast in December 2021, global advertising expenditure will continue its recovery from pandemic in 2020 with 9.1% growth in 2022, after 15.6% growth in 2021. Zenith estimates that global ad spend may reach $705 billion in 2021 and will rise to $873 billion by 2024. We believe there is a sizable travel and entertainment industry in which we participate in that provides an opportunity to find high quality deals for our members. Based upon this outlook for the travel industry, we believe that we are well positioned with our operations in Europe and North America to capture high quality deals for our members. 
Digital advertising, a notable market, has been growing continuously. According to Zenith Media, digital advertising is expected to account for 61.5% of global advertising spending in 2022 and 65.1% by 2024. In addition, according to the Kelsey Group's (BIA/Kelsey) new U.S. Local Media Forecast in December 2021, BIA/Kelsey estimates total local advertising spending to be $173 billion in 2022, indicating a 11.4% increase over 2021. We believe that traditional media outlets such as newspapers, television and radio continue to be another medium for travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers, though the percentage spent on advertising in these traditional media outlets is decreasing. In addition, the continued rise in smart phones has changed the business rules for online marketing, with the consumption of online advertising rapidly moving to mobile devices. 
We believe that several factors are causing and will continue to cause travel, entertainment and local businesses to increase their spending on Internet and mobile advertising of offers: 
    The Internet Is Consumers' Preferred Information Source. Market research shows that the Internet has become consumers' preferred information source for travel. 
    Benefits of Internet Advertising vs. Print, TV and Radio Advertising. Internet advertising provides advertisers advantages compared to traditional advertising. These advantages include real-time listings, real-time updates, and performance tracking. See “Benefits to Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses” below. 
    New Advertising Opportunities. The Internet allows advertisers to advertise their sales and specials in a fast, flexible, and cost-effective manner that has not been possible before. 
    Suppliers Selling Directly. We believe that many travel suppliers prefer to sell directly to consumers through suppliers' websites versus selling through travel agents. Internet advertising attracts consumers to suppliers' websites. 
    Growth of Mobile Advertising. Mobile advertising extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. As advertisers continue to shift budgets to mobile advertising, we continue to focus on developing easy-to-use mobile applications to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our advertisers, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go. We continue to invest in improving users' access to our services through such devices.
Challenges Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses Face and Limitations of Newspaper, TV and Radio Advertising 
We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses often face the challenge of being able to effectively and quickly market and sell their excess inventory (i.e. airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise cabins, theater seats, spa appointments or restaurant seats that are likely to be unfilled). The success of marketing excess inventory can have a substantial impact on a company's profitability. Almost all costs of these services are fixed. That is, the costs do not vary significantly with sales. A relatively small amount of unsold inventory can have a significant impact on the profitability of a company. 
We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses need a fast, flexible, and cost-effective solution for marketing excess inventory. The solution must be fast, because services are a quickly expiring commodity. The period between the time when a company realizes that there is excess inventory and the time when the service has become worthless is very short. The solution must be flexible, because the demand for excess inventory is difficult to forecast. It is difficult for travel, entertainment and local businesses to price excess inventory and to forecast the marketing effort needed to sell excess inventory. The marketing must be cost-effective, because excess inventory is often sold at highly discounted prices, which lowers margins. 
We believe that newspaper, TV and radio advertising, with respect to advertising excess inventory, suffers from a number of limitations which do not apply to the Internet: 
•typically, ads must be submitted 2 to 5 days prior to the publication or airing date, which makes it difficult to advertise last-minute inventory; 
•once an ad is published, it cannot be updated or deleted when an offer is sold out; 
•once an ad is published, the company cannot change a price or offer; 
•in many markets, the small number of newspapers, television companies, radio stations and other print media reduces competition, resulting in high rates for traditional advertising;  
•offline advertising does not allow for detailed performance tracking; and
•creative content can be very expensive to develop. 
Our Products and Services 
We provide airlines, hotels, cruise lines, vacation packagers, other travel suppliers, entertainment and local businesses with a fast, flexible, and cost-effective way to reach millions of Internet users. Our publications include the Travelzoo website, the Travelzoo Top 20 email newsletter, the Newsflash email alert service, the Local Deals and Getaways email alert services and Jack's Flight Club newsletter.

While our products provide advertising opportunities for travel, entertainment and local businesses, they also provide Internet users with a free source of information on current sales and specials from thousands of travel, entertainment and local businesses. 
As travel, entertainment and local businesses increasingly utilize the Internet to promote their offers, we believe that our products will enable them to take advantage of the lower cost and real-time communication enabled by the Internet. Our listing management software allows our advertisers to add, update, and delete special offer listings on a real-time basis. Our software also provides our advertisers with real-time performance tracking, enabling them to optimize their marketing campaigns. Mobile advertising extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. We are focused on developing easy-to-use mobile applications to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our customers, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go. We continue to invest in improving users' access to our services through such devices. In addition, we continue to develop our hotel booking platform, which enables our users to more easily book hotel stays using our hotel deals presented on our website and mobile devices.

We believe that high-quality content attracts a high-quality user base.

Some of our advertisers are:

Exoticca | Shutterfly 
Fairmont Mayakoba | Silversea Cruises 
Gate 1 Travel | Stunning Tours

As discussed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we did not have any advertisers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The agreements with certain advertisers are in the form of multiple insertion orders and merchant agreements from groups of entities under common control. 
In 2021, Travelzoo North America operations were 67% of revenues, Travelzoo Europe operations were 28% of revenues and Jack’s Flight Club operations were 5% of revenues. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Sales and Marketing 
As of December 31, 2021, our advertising sales force and sales support staff consisted of 73 employees worldwide. 
We currently utilize online marketing and direct marketing to promote our brand to consumers. In addition, we utilize an online marketing program to acquire new members for our email publications. We believe that we build brand awareness by product excellence that is promoted by word-of-mouth. We utilize sponsorships at industry conferences and public relations to promote our brands. 
Technology 
We have designed our technology to serve a large volume of Web traffic and send a large volume of emails in an efficient and scalable manner. 
Travelzoo's production servers are hosted in Microsoft Azure. (“Azure”), a cloud base computing service operated by Microsoft. Microsoft Azure's data center facilities and services include robust high availability, reliability and scalability features. We believe our arrangements with Microsoft Azure will allow us to grow without being limited by our own physical and technological capacity. Because of the design of our websites, our users are not required to download or upload large files from or to our websites, which allows us to continue increasing the number of our visitors and page views without adversely affecting our performance or requiring us to make significant additional capital expenditures. 
Competition 
The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. We compete for advertising dollars with large Internet portal sites, such as Trip Advisor, that offer listings or other advertising opportunities to travel, entertainment and local businesses. We compete with companies like Groupon that sell vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants and tour operators for vacation packages. We compete with search engines like Google that offer pay-per-click listings. Additionally, certain search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products. For example, Google has continued to add features and functionality to its flight and hotel metasearch products, which have grown rapidly 
and has also further integrated its “Book on Google” reservation functionality into its products. We compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that operate websites which provide online advertising opportunities. We compete with travel metasearch engines like Kayak.com (owned by Booking Holdings) and online travel and entertainment deal publishers (including online restaurant reservation services). We compete with large online travel agencies like the Expedia Group and Booking Holdings, as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world, that also offer advertising placements and hotel booking platforms and capture consumer interest. There has been substantial consolidation of the global travel industry and we believe this trend will continue. Some of our competitors are large and have significant resources and substantial international operations. Such companies have also completed acquisitions to further consolidate the industry. 
There has also been a proliferation of new channels and platforms through which accommodation providers can offer reservations. For example, companies such as Airbnb (which acquired HotelTonight), HomeAway and VRBO (which are both owned by Expedia Group) offer services providing alternative accommodation property owners, particularly individuals, an online place to list their alternative accommodations, which compete with our hotel offers. Further, meta-search services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant's brand to drive consumers directly to its website. Some competitors offer a variety of online services, such as food delivery, shopping, gaming or search services, many of which are used by consumers more frequently than online travel services. As a result, a competitor that has established other, more frequent online interactions with consumers may be able to more easily or cost-effectively acquire customers for its travel services than we can. If any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to consumers who would otherwise use our platforms or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs could increase, either of which would harm our business and results of operations. We also have seen that some competitors will accept lower margins, or negative margins, to attract attention and acquire new members. If competitors engage in group buying initiatives in which merchants receive a higher percentage of the face value than we currently offer, we may be forced to pay a higher percentage of the face value than we currently offer, which may reduce our revenue. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies, including print media companies, enter the online advertising market. Competition could result in reduced margins on our services, loss of market share or less use of Travelzoo by advertisers and consumers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger advertiser bases than we do. Others have lower overhead and appeal to a different segment of the population. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive solutions. 
New technologies could increase the competitive pressures that we face. The development of competing technologies by market participants or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position. Competition could result in reduced margins on our services, loss of market share or less use of our products by our advertisers and consumers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected. 
Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties 
There are increasing numbers of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations relating to user privacy, liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online content regulation, and domain name registration. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. 
Privacy Concerns. We are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018 and has resulted in greater compliance burdens for companies, including us, with users in Europe. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act was passed and creates new data privacy rights for users, which became effective in January 2020. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield and required that the transfer of information between the EU and the US be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Violations of privacy-related laws can also result in significant penalties. We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, and increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
Anti-Spam Legislation. The CAN-SPAM Act, a federal anti-spam law, pre-empts various state anti-spam laws and establishes a single standard for email marketing and customer communications. We believe that this law, on an overall basis, benefits our business as we do not use spam techniques or practices and may benefit now that others are prohibited from doing so. We are also subject to anti-spam laws in the various jurisdictions that we operate, including Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation. We continually review our practices to ensure our continued compliance with these regulations.
Domain Names. Domain names are the user's Internet “addresses.” The current system for registering, allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and of proposed regulatory reform. We have registered travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.jp, travelzoo.com.au, travelzoo.com.tw, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de and travelzoo.fr, among other domain names, and have registered “Travelzoo” as a trademark in the United States, Canada, the European Union and certain countries throughout Asia Pacific. Because of these protections, it is unlikely, yet possible, that third parties may bring claims for infringement against us for the use of our domain name and trademark. In the event such claims are successful, we could lose the ability to use our domain names. There can be no assurance that our domain names will not lose their value, or that we will not have to obtain entirely new domain names in addition to or in lieu of our current domain names if changes in overall Internet domain name rules result in a restructuring in the current system of using domain names which include “.com,” “.net,” “.gov,” “.edu” and other extensions. 
Jurisdictions. Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our transmissions over the Internet originate primarily in California, the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate our business activities. In addition, because our service is available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, these jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries, which could subject us to additional taxes and other regulations.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our brand names, including Travelzoo, Top 20 and Jack's Flight Club. If we were unable to protect the Travelzoo, Top 20 and Jack's Flight Club brand names, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely upon a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We have registered the Travelzoo and Top 20 trademarks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered the Travelzoo and Travelzoo Top 20 trademarks with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market of the European Community. We have registered the Travelzoo trademark in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Jack’s Flight Club has registered the Jack’s Flight Club trademark in the United States and the European Union. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information. 
We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The laws of other countries in which we may market our services in the future are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
