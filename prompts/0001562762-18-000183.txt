 GENERAL
 ﻿
 Monro is a chain of 1,150 Company-operated stores (as of March 31, 2018), 102 franchised locations, five wholesale locations, two retread facilities and two dealer-operated stores providing automotive undercar repair and tire sales and services in the United States.  At March 31, 2018, Monro operated Company stores in 27 states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin, primarily under the names “Monro Muffler Brake & Service”, “Tread Quarters Discount Tire”, “Mr. Tire”, “Autotire Car Care Center”, “Tire Warehouse”, “Tire Barn Warehouse”, “Ken Towery’s Tire & Auto Care”, “The Tire Choice” and “Car-X”.  Company-operated stores typically are situated in high-visibility locations in suburban areas and small towns, as well as in major metropolitan areas.  Company-operated stores serviced approximately 6.2 million vehicles in fiscal 2018.  (References herein to fiscal years are to the Company's year ended fiscal March [e.g., references to "fiscal 2018" are to the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2018].)
 ﻿
 The predecessor to the Company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957 as a Midas Muffler franchise in Rochester, New York, specializing in mufflers and exhaust systems.  The Company was incorporated in the State of New York in 1959.  In 1966, we discontinued our affiliation with Midas Muffler, and began to diversify into a full line of undercar repair services.  An investor group led by Peter J. Solomon and Donald Glickman purchased a controlling interest in the Company in July 1984.  At that time, Monro operated 59 stores, located primarily in upstate New York, with approximately $21 million in sales in fiscal 1984.  Since 1984, we have continued our growth and have expanded our marketing area to include 26 additional states.
 ﻿
 Effective as of August 1, 2017, Brett T. Ponton began his role as President of the Company upon the resignation of John W. Van Heel.  Further, upon the expiration of Mr. Van Heel’s term of employment on October 1, 2017, Mr. Ponton assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective as of October 2, 2017.
 ﻿
 The Company's principal executive offices are located at 200 Holleder Parkway, Rochester, New York 14615, and our telephone number is (585) 647-6400.
 ﻿
 Monro provides a broad range of services on passenger cars, light trucks and vans for brakes; mufflers and exhaust systems; and steering, drive train, suspension and wheel alignment.  Monro also provides other products and services, including tires and routine maintenance services, including state inspections.  Monro specializes in the repair and replacement of parts which must be periodically replaced as they wear out.  Normal wear on these parts generally is not covered by new car warranties.  Monro typically does not perform under-the-hood repair services except for oil change services, various “flush and fill” services and some minor tune-up services.

     All of the Company-operated stores, except Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores, provide the services described above.  Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores only sell tires and tire related services and alignments.  However, a growing number of our Company-operated stores are more specialized in tire replacement and service and, accordingly, have a higher mix of sales in the tire category.  These Company-operated stores are described below as tire stores, whereas the remaining stores are described as service stores.  (See additional discussion under “Operations”.)  Included in the number of Company-operated stores described as tire stores are certain locations that also service commercial customers.  Our locations that serve commercial customers conduct tire and automotive repair activities that are similar to our retail locations, other than with respect to the sales mix resulting from the sale of commercial tires.  At March 31, 2018, there were 542 stores designated as service stores and 608 as tire stores.
 ﻿
 During fiscal 2017, we acquired four wholesale locations and one retread facility located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee in connection with the Clark Tire & Auto, Inc. acquisition that operate under the Tires Now name.  Additionally during fiscal 2017, we acquired one retread facility located in Florida in connection with the McGee Tire Stores, Inc. acquisition that operates under the McGee Tire name.  (See additional discussion under Note 2 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 ﻿
 As of March 31, 2018, Monro had five wholesale locations and two retread facilities.  The wholesale locations, in most cases, sell tires to customers for resale, although these tire sales do not include installation or other tire related services.  The retread facilities re-manufacture tires through the replacement of tread on worn tires that are later sold to customers.
 ﻿
 Our sales mix for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

  ﻿
 The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Monro Service Corporation and Car-X, LLC.
 ﻿
 Monro Service Corporation, a Delaware corporation qualified to do business in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, holds all assets, rights, responsibilities and liabilities associated with our warehousing, purchasing, advertising, accounting, office services, payroll, cash management and certain other operations that are performed in the aforementioned states.  We believe that this structure has enhanced operational efficiency and provides cost savings.
 ﻿
 On April 25, 2015, we acquired the Car-X brand, as well as the franchise rights for 146 auto service centers from Car-X Associates Corp.  Car-X, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, operates as the franchisor through a standard royalty agreement, while Car-X remains a separate and independent brand and business with franchise operations based in Illinois.
 ﻿
 As of March 31, 2018, Monro had 101 Car-X franchised locations.
 ﻿
 Monro’s operations are organized and managed in one operating segment.  The internal management financial reporting that is the basis for evaluation in order to assess performance and allocate resources by our chief operating decision maker consists of consolidated data that includes the results of our retail, commercial and wholesale locations.  As such, our one operating segment reflects how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
 ﻿
 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 ﻿
 Demand for automotive repair services, including undercar repair and tire sales and services is correlated to the overall number of vehicles in operation and the increasing average age of vehicles, and to a lesser extent, with increased average miles driven.  The number of vehicles in operation is expected to continue to grow over the next several years, with vehicles six years or older representing the vast majority of this growth.  This is in contrast to the past several years in which the number of vehicles six to 12 years old declined significantly in response to the lower volume of new vehicles sold during 2008 to 2012.  Additionally, vehicles continue to increase in complexity, making it more difficult for a vehicle owner to perform do-it-yourself repairs.
 ﻿
 At the same time as demand for automotive repair services has grown, the number of general repair outlets has decreased.  We believe that these factors present opportunities for increased sales by the Company.

     ﻿
 EXPANSION STRATEGY
 ﻿
 Monro has experienced significant growth in recent years through acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, the opening of newly constructed stores.  Management believes that the continued growth in sales and profits of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon our continued ability to open/acquire and operate new stores on a profitable basis.  Overall profitability of the Company may not meet expectations if acquired or new stores do not attain expected profitability.
 ﻿
 Monro believes that there are significant expansion opportunities in new as well as existing market areas, which may result from a combination of constructing stores on vacant land and acquiring existing store locations as well as purchasing existing businesses.  We believe that, as the industry consolidates due to the increasingly complex nature of automotive repair, the expanded capital requirements for state-of-the-art equipment and aging of existing shop owners, there will be increasing opportunities for acquisitions of existing businesses or store structures.
 ﻿
 In that regard, we have completed many acquisitions, including:

  ﻿
 We plan to add approximately 20 to 40 new greenfield stores in fiscal 2019 and to pursue appropriate acquisition candidates.  Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operations.
 ﻿
 Key factors in market and site selection for selecting new greenfield store locations include population, demographic characteristics, vehicle population and the intensity of competition.  Monro attempts to cluster stores in market areas in order to achieve economies of scale in advertising, supervision and distribution costs.  All new greenfield sites presently under consideration are within Monro's established market areas. 
 ﻿
 As a result of extensive analysis of our historical and projected store opening strategy, we have established major market profiles, as defined by market awareness: mature, existing and new markets.  Over the next several years, we expect to build or acquire a greater percentage of stores in mature and existing markets in order to capitalize on our market presence and consumer awareness.  During fiscal 2018, 42 of the stores added (including acquired stores) were located in existing markets and seven stores were added in new markets.
 ﻿
 Monro has a chain-wide computerized inventory control and point-of-sale (“POS”) management information system, which has increased management's ability to monitor operations as the number of stores has grown.  We have customized the POS system to specific service and tire store requirements and deploy the appropriate version in each type of store.  The system includes the following:
 ﻿

· | Entry of a license plate and state automatically fills in vehicle identification number (“VIN”), year, make, and model. This provides accurate VIN, year, make, and model information while simplifying the estimate process at the store; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Online catalogs and online parts ordering directly with vendors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic mail and electronic cataloging, which allows store managers to electronically research the specific parts needed for the make and model of the car being serviced;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic repair manuals that allow for instant access to a single source of accurate, up-to-date, original equipment manufacturer-direct diagnosis, repair and maintenance information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Software which contains data that mirrors the scheduled maintenance requirements in vehicle owner’s manuals, specifically by make, model, year and mileage for every major automobile brand. Management believes that this software facilitates the presentation and sale of scheduled maintenance services to customers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanded monitoring of price changes. This requires more specificity on the reason for a discount, which management believes helps to control discounting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Enhancements will continue to be made to the POS system in an effort to increase efficiency, improve the quality and timeliness of store reporting and enable us to better serve our customers. 
 ﻿
 The financing to build a new greenfield service store location may be accomplished in one of three ways: (i) a store lease for the land and building (in which case, land and building costs will be financed primarily by the lessor), (ii) a land lease with the building constructed by Monro (with building costs paid by Monro), or (iii) a land purchase with the building constructed by Monro.  In all three cases, for service stores, each new store also will require approximately $225,000 for equipment (including a POS system and a truck) and approximately $55,000 in inventory.  Because we generally do not extend credit to most customers, stores generate almost no receivables and a new store's actual net working capital investment is nominal.  Total capital required to build a new greenfield service store ranges, on average, from $360,000 to $990,000 depending on the location and which of the three financing methods is used.  In general, tire stores are larger and have more service bays than Monro’s traditional service stores and, as a result, construction costs are at the high end of the range of new store construction costs.  Total capital required to build a new greenfield tire (land and building leased) location costs, on average, approximately $600,000, including $250,000 for equipment and $150,000 for inventory.  In instances where Monro acquires an existing business, it may pay additional amounts for intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not-to-compete, trade names and goodwill, but generally will pay less per bay for equipment and real property.   
 ﻿
 At March 31, 2018, we leased the land and/or the building at approximately 71% of our store locations and owned the land and building at the remaining locations.  Monro's policy is to situate new stores in the best locations, without regard to the form of ownership required to develop the locations.
 ﻿
 New service and tire stores, (excluding acquired stores), have average sales of approximately $400,000 and $1,050,000, respectively, in their first 12 months of operation, or $67,000 and $150,000, respectively, per bay.
 ﻿
 STORE OPERATIONS
 ﻿
 Store Format
 ﻿
 The typical format for a Monro store is a free-standing building consisting of a sales area, fully-equipped service bays and a parts/tires storage area.  Most service bays are equipped with above-ground electric vehicle lifts.  Generally, each store is located within 25 miles of a “key” store which carries approximately double the inventory of a typical store and serves as a mini-distribution point for slower moving inventory for other stores in its area.  Individual store sizes, number of bays and stocking levels vary greatly, even within the service and tire store groups, and are dependent primarily on the availability of suitable store locations, population, demographics and intensity of competition among other factors.  (See additional discussion under “Store Additions and Closings”).  A summary of average store data for service and tire stores is presented below:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | | | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+---------+--------------+---------
﻿ | | | | | | 
 | | | | | | Average 
 | | | | | | Number 
 | Average | Average | | | | of Stock
 | Number | Square | Average | | Keeping 
 | of Bays | Feet | Inventory | | Units (SKUs)
Service stores | 6 | 4,600 | $ | 95,000 | | 2,100 
Tire stores (excluding Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores) | 8 | 6,600 | $ | 133,000 | | 1,300 

  ﻿
 Data for the Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores has been excluded because these locations primarily install new tires and wheels and many perform alignments.  Additionally, most Tire Warehouse stores have one indoor service bay to perform alignments.  The store building houses a waiting room, storage area and an area to mount and balance tires on the car’s wheels once the wheels and tires have been removed from the car.  Removal of old tires and wheels from, and installation of new tires and wheels on, customers’ cars are performed outdoors under a carport.  The average inventory carried by the Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores is $230,000 per store.
 ﻿
 Stores generally are situated in high-visibility locations in suburban areas, major metropolitan areas or small towns and offer easy customer access.  The typical store is open from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday and from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday.  A majority of store locations are also open Sundays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

     ﻿
 Inventory Control and Management Information System
 ﻿
 All Company stores communicate daily with the central office and warehouse by computerized inventory control and electronic POS management information systems, which enable us to collect sales and operational data on a daily basis, to adjust store pricing to reflect local conditions and to control inventory on a near "real-time" basis.  Additionally, each store has access, through the POS system, to the inventory carried by up to the 14 stores or warehouse nearest to it.  Management believes that this feature improves customer satisfaction and store productivity by reducing the time required to locate out-of-stock parts and tires.  It also improves profitability because it reduces the amount of inventory which must be purchased outside Monro from local vendors.
 ﻿
 Quality Control and Warranties
 ﻿
 To maintain quality control, we conduct audits to rate our employees' telephone sales manner and the accuracy of pricing information given.
 ﻿
 We have a customer review and survey program to monitor customer attitudes toward service quality, friendliness, speed of service, and overall customer experience for each store.  Customer concerns are addressed by customer service and field management personnel.
 ﻿
 Monro uses a “Double Check for Accuracy Program” as part of our routine store procedures.  This quality assurance program requires that a technician and supervisory-level employee independently inspect a customer’s vehicle, diagnose and document the necessary repairs, and agree on an estimate before presenting it to a customer.  This process is formally documented on the written estimate by store personnel.  
 ﻿
 We are an active member of the Automotive Maintenance & Repair Association (“AMRA”).  AMRA is an organization of automotive retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers which was established as part of an industry-wide effort to address the ethics and business practices of companies in the automotive repair industry through the Motorist Assurance Program (“MAP”).  Participating companies commit to improving consumer confidence and trust in the automotive repair industry by adopting “Uniform Inspection Communication Standards” (“UICS”) established by MAP.  These “UICS” are available in our stores and serve to provide consistent recommendations to customers in the diagnosis and repair of a vehicle.
 ﻿
 We offer limited warranties on substantially all of the products and services that we provide.  We believe that these warranties are competitive with industry practices and serve as a marketing tool to increase repeat business at our stores.
 ﻿
 Store Personnel and Training
 ﻿
 Monro supervises store operations primarily through our Divisional Vice Presidents who oversee Zone Managers who, in turn, oversee District Managers.  The typical service store is staffed by a Store Manager and four to six technicians, one of whom serves as the Assistant Manager.  The typical tire store, except Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn stores, is staffed by a Store Manager, an Assistant Manager and/or Service Manager, and four to eight technicians.  Larger volume service and tire stores may also have one or two sales people.  The higher staffing level at many tire stores is necessary to support their higher sales volume.  Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn stores are generally staffed by a Store Manager and two to four technicians, one of whom serves as the Assistant Manager.  All Store Managers receive a base salary and Assistant Managers receive either hourly or salaried compensation.  In addition, Store Managers and Assistant Managers may receive other compensation based on their store's customer relations, store profit, sales volume and other factors via a monthly or quarterly bonus based on performance in these areas.
 ﻿
 We believe that the ability to recruit and retain qualified technicians is an important competitive factor in the automotive repair industry, which has historically experienced a high turnover rate.  We make a concerted effort to recruit individuals who will have a long-term commitment to the Company and offer an hourly rate structure and additional compensation based on productivity; a competitive benefits package including health, dental, life and disability insurance; a 401(k)/profit-sharing plan; as well as the opportunity to advance within the Company.  Many of our Store Managers and District Managers started with the Company as technicians.
 ﻿
 Many of our new technicians join the Company in their early twenties as trainees or apprentices.  As they progress, many are promoted to technician and eventually master technician, the latter requiring Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”) certification in eight different categories.  We will reimburse technicians for the cost of ASE certification registration fees and test fees and encourage all technicians to become certified by providing a higher hourly wage rate following their certification.  We also offer free online ASE certification preparation courses, as well as a tool purchase program through which trainee technicians can acquire their own set of tools.
 ﻿
 Our training program provides multiple training sessions to both Store Managers and technicians in each store, each year.  
 ﻿

     Management training courses are developed and delivered by our dedicated training department and operations management, and are supplemented with live and on-line vendor training courses.  Management training covers safety, customer service, sales, human resources (counseling, recruiting, interviewing, etc.), leadership, scheduling, financial and operational areas, and is delivered on a regular basis.  We believe that involving operations management in the development and delivery of these sessions results in more relevant and actionable training for Store Managers, and helps to improve overall performance and staff retention.  
 ﻿
 Our training department develops and coordinates technical training courses on critical areas of automotive repair to Monro technicians (e.g. Antilock braking systems (“ABS”) brake repair, drivability, tire pressure monitoring system (“TPMS”), etc.) and also conducts required technical training to maintain compliance with state inspection licenses, where applicable, and AMRA/MAP accreditation.  Additionally, our training department holds periodic field technical clinics for store personnel and coordinates technician attendance at technical clinics offered by our vendors.  We have electronic repair manuals installed in all of our stores for daily reference.  We also issue technical bulletins to all stores on innovative or complex repair processes, and maintain a centralized database for technical repair problems.  In addition, Monro has established a telephone technical help line to provide assistance to store personnel in resolving problems encountered while diagnosing and repairing vehicles.  The help line is available during all hours of store operation.  In March 2017, we introduced a comprehensive set of on-line courses in automotive repair and tire service for our technicians to participate in.  These courses are offered at no cost to our employees.
 ﻿
 Monro also maintains an employee website that contains many resources for both managers and technicians to reference including Human Resource information and forms.  Additionally, there is a Facilities section containing important environmental and equipment information, as well as a Training section that contains training programs, including on-line training videos, and documents for both managers and technicians.
 ﻿
 OPERATIONS
 ﻿
 Monro provides our customers with a wide range of dependable, high-quality tire and automotive services at a competitive price by emphasizing the following key elements.
 ﻿
 Products and Services
 ﻿
 The typical store provides a full range of undercar repair services for brakes, steering, mufflers and exhaust systems, drive train, suspension and wheel alignment, as well as tire replacement and service.  These services apply to all makes and models of domestic and foreign cars, light trucks and vans.  As a percentage of sales, the service stores provide significantly more brake and maintenance services than tire stores, and tire stores provide substantially more tire replacement and related services than service stores.
 ﻿
 Stores generally provide many of the routine maintenance services (except engine diagnostic), which automobile manufacturers suggest or require in the vehicle owner’s manuals, and which fulfill manufacturers’ requirements for new car warranty compliance.  We offer "Scheduled Maintenance" services in our stores whereby the aforementioned services are packaged and offered to consumers based upon the year, make, model and mileage of each specific vehicle.  Management believes that we offer this service in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide.
 ﻿
 Included in maintenance services are oil change services, heating and cooling system "flush and fill" service, belt installation, fuel system service and a transmission "flush and fill" service.  Additionally, most stores replace and service batteries, starters and alternators.  Stores in certain states also perform annual state inspections.  Additionally, approximately 68% of our stores offer air conditioning services.
 ﻿
 The format of the Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores are slightly different from Monro’s typical service or tire stores (as described above) in that, generally, over 93% of the stores’ sales involve tire services, including the mounting and balancing of tires, and the sale of road hazard warranties.  Most of these stores also provide the installation of wiper blades.  Currently, 78% of Tire Warehouse and 90% of Tire Barn Warehouse stores perform alignments.  In fiscal year 2019, Monro plans to expand the number of Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores offering alignment services to 85% of total stores, as compared to 82% of total Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores offering alignment services in fiscal 2018.

     Customer Satisfaction
 ﻿
 Monro’s vision is to be America’s leading chain of tire and auto service centers, trusted by consumers as the best place for quality, professional tire and vehicle service within the neighborhoods we serve.  To achieve our vision, we exceed our customers’ expectations through focus on the following guiding principles each day:
 ﻿

· | Recognize each customer as a guest in our store;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Work hard to earn the trust of that guest and to strengthen that trust, one visit at a time;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Respect our guests’ time and the significant part their vehicles play in their lives; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build long-term loyalty based on daily efforts grounded in integrity, consistency, competency and professionalism.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In support of our commitment to customer service, each Company-operated store operates under the following set of customer satisfaction principles: free inspection of brakes, tires, shocks, front end and exhaust systems (as applicable); item-by-item review with customers of problem areas; free written estimates; written guarantees; drive-in service without an appointment; fair and reasonable prices; a 30-day best price guarantee; and repairs by professionally-trained undercar and tire specialists.  (See additional discussion under “Store Operations: Quality Control and Warranties”)
 ﻿
 Competitive Pricing, Advertising and Co-branding Initiatives
 ﻿
 Monro seeks to set competitive prices for quality services and products.  We support our pricing strategy with special offers and coupons distributed through a variety of channels including: direct mail, e-mail, digital advertising, newspaper, promotional store signage and in-store displays.  In addition, to increase consumer awareness of the services we offer, Monro advertises through radio, cable television and yellow page advertising.  Our digital marketing efforts include paid and organic search on all major search engines, search remarketing and banner and mobile advertising.  We also manage social media profiles on a variety of platforms.
 ﻿
 Our websites include www.Monro.com, www.MrTire.com, www.TQTire.com, www.AutoTire.com, www.TireWarehouse.net, www.KenTowery.com, www.TireBarn.com, www.TheTireChoice.com and www.Tiresnowonline.com.  These websites help customers search for store locations, print coupons, make service appointments, shop for tires and access information on our services and products, as well as car care tips.
 ﻿
 Monro currently maintains mobile apps on the iPhone and Android platforms that enable customers to access information, coupons and specials and make appointments on their smart phones, as they do on our websites.
 ﻿
 Centralized Control
 ﻿
 While we both operate and franchise stores, we believe that direct operation of stores enhances our ability to compete by providing centralized control of such areas of operations as service quality, store appearance, promotional activity and pricing.  We also believe our experience in operating stores makes us a more valuable partner to our franchisees.  A high level of competence is maintained throughout the Company, as we require as a condition of employment, that employees participate in periodic training programs, including sales, management, customer service and changes in automotive technology.  Additionally, purchasing, distribution, merchandising, advertising, accounting and other store support functions are centralized primarily in Monro's corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York and are provided through our subsidiary, Monro Service Corporation.  The centralization of these functions results in efficiencies and gives management the ability to closely monitor and control costs.
 ﻿
 Comprehensive Training
 ﻿
 We provide ongoing and comprehensive training to our store employees.  We believe that such training provides a competitive advantage by enabling our technicians to provide quality service to our customers in all areas of undercar repair and tire service.  (See additional discussion under “Store Operations: Store Personnel and Training”)
 ﻿
 PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTION
 ﻿
 Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monro Service Corporation, we select and purchase tires, parts and supplies for all Company-operated stores on a centralized basis through an automatic replenishment system.  Although purchases outside the centralized system are made when needed at the store level, these purchases are low by industry standards and accounted for approximately 20% of all parts and tires used in fiscal 2018.
 ﻿
 Our ten largest vendors accounted for approximately 77% of our parts and tire purchases, with the largest vendor accounting for approximately 26% of total stocking purchases in fiscal 2018.  In fiscal 2018, Monro imported approximately 20% of our parts and tire purchases.  We purchase parts, oil and tires from approximately 120 vendors.  Management believes that our relationships with vendors are excellent and that alternative sources of supply exist, at comparable cost, for substantially all parts used in our business.  We routinely obtain bids from vendors to ensure we are receiving competitive pricing and terms.

     ﻿
 Most parts are shipped by vendors to our primary warehouse facility in Rochester, New York, and are distributed to stores by the Monro-operated tractor/trailer fleet.  The majority of tires are shipped to our stores directly by vendors pursuant to orders placed by our headquarters staff.  Stores are replenished at least bi-weekly from our Rochester warehouse, and such replenishment fills, on average, 97% of all items ordered by the stores' automatic POS-driven replenishment system.  The Rochester warehouse stocks approximately 2,800 SKUs.  Monro also operates warehouses in Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky, North Carolina (including two warehouse locations), South Carolina, and Tennessee.  These warehouses carry, on average, 1,400, 100, 800, 3,300, 5,200, 3,200, 3,000, and 2,500 SKUs, respectively.
 ﻿
 We enter into contracts with certain parts and tire suppliers, some of which require us to buy (at market competitive prices) up to 100% of our annual purchases of specific products.  These agreements expire at various dates.  We believe these agreements provide us with high quality, branded merchandise at preferred pricing, along with strong marketing and training support.
 ﻿
 COMPETITION
 ﻿
 Monro competes in the automotive service and tire industry.  This industry is generally highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely from region to region.  We believe that competition in this industry is based on customer service and reputation, store location, name awareness and price.  Monro's primary competitors include national and regional undercar, tire specialty and general automotive service chains, both franchised and company-operated; car dealerships, mass merchandisers’ operating service centers; and, to a lesser extent, gas stations, independent garages and Internet tire sellers.  Monro considers TBC Corporation (operating under the NTB, Merchant’s Tire, Midas and Tire Kingdom brands), Firestone Complete Auto Care service stores, The Pep Boys – Manny, Moe and Jack service stores, Meineke Discount Mufflers Inc., and Mavis Discount Tire to be direct competitors.  In most of the new markets that we have entered, at least one competitor was already present.  In identifying new markets, we analyze, among other factors, the intensity of competition.  (See "Expansion Strategy” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations")
 ﻿
 EMPLOYEES
 ﻿
 As of March 31, 2018, Monro had 7,878 employees, of whom 7,360 were employed in the field organization, 224 were employed at the warehouses, 234 were employed at our corporate headquarters and 60 were employed in other offices.  Monro's employees are not members of any union.  We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 ﻿
 REGULATION
 ﻿
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including, among other things, those regarding employment and labor practices, workplace safety, zoning and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products that we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.  We maintain programs to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations.  We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental and other laws and regulations, and our related compliance costs are not material.
 ﻿
 Monro stores new oil and recycled antifreeze and generates and/or handles used tires and automotive oils, antifreeze and certain solvents, which are disposed of by licensed third-party contractors.  In certain states, as required, we also recycle oil filters.  Accordingly, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”).  In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as well as various state and local environmental protection agencies, regulate our handling and disposal of certain waste products and other materials.  The EPA, under the Clean Air Act, also regulates the installation of catalytic converters by periodically spot checking repair jobs, and may impose sanctions, including but not limited to civil penalties up to $37,500 per violation (or up to $37,500 per day for certain willful violations or failures to cooperate with authorities), for violations of RCRA and the Clean Air Act.  
 ﻿
 Monro strives to maintain an environmentally conscious corporate culture.  Among other things, Monro endeavors to take advantage of various recycling opportunities at our offices, warehouses and stores.  For example, cardboard, plastic shrink wrap and parts’ cores are returned to our Rochester warehouse on Monro stock trucks where they are accumulated for sale to recycling companies or returned to parts manufacturers for credit.

     SEASONALITY
 ﻿
 Although our business is not highly seasonal, customers do purchase more undercar service during the period of March through October than the period of November through February, when miles driven tend to be lower.  In the tire stores, the better sales months are typically May through August, and October through December.  The slowest months are typically January through April and September.  As a result, profitability is typically lower during slower sales months, or months where mix is more heavily weighted toward tires, which is a lower margin category.  Additionally, since our stores are primarily located in the northeastern and midwestern United States, profitability tends to be lower in the winter months when certain costs, such as utilities and snow plowing, are typically higher.
