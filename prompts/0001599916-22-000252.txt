Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
Next Meats Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Turnkey Solutions, Inc., was incorporated on April 15, 2020 in the State of Nevada.
 
On April 15, 2020, Paul Moody was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company, at the time known as “Turnkey Solutions, Inc.”
 
On October 1, 2020, the Company, at the time known as “Turnkey Solutions, Inc.” (the “Company” or “Successor”) announced on Form 8-K plans to participate in a holding company reorganization (“the Reorganization” or “Merger”) with Intermedia Marketing Solutions, Inc. (“IMMM” or “Predecessor”) and Intermedia Marketing Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) collectively (the “Constituent Corporations”) pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250. Immediately prior to the Reorganization, the Company was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Intermedia Marketing Solutions, Inc. and Intermedia Marketing Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The effective date and time of the Reorganization was October 28, 2020 at 4PM PST (the “Effective Time”). The entire plan of Merger is on file with Nevada Secretary of State (“NSOS”) and included in the Articles of Merger pursuant to NRS 92A.200 Nevada Secretary of State (“NSOS”) and attached to and made a part thereof to the Articles of Merger pursuant to NRS 92A.200 filed with NSOS on October 16, 2020. At the Effective Time, Predecessor merged with and into its indirect and wholly owned subsidiary, Merger Sub with Predecessor as the surviving corporation resulting in Predecessor as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Concurrently and after the Effective Time, the Company cancelled all of its stock held in Predecessor resulting in the Company as a stand-alone and separate entity with no subsidiaries, no assets and negligible liabilities. The assets and liabilities of Predecessor, if any, remained with Predecessor. The Company abandoned the business plan of its Predecessor and resumed its former business plan of a blank check company after completion of the Merger.
 
Full details pertaining to the Reorganization can be viewed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on October 29, 2020.
 
On November 18, 2020 our now former controlling shareholder, Flint Consulting Services, LLC sold 35,000,000 shares of common stock to Next Meats Co., Ltd., a Japan Company. Next Meats Co., Ltd. is a Japanese Company that operates in the “alternative meat” industry. It currently offers, and plans to continue to offer, amongst other things, artificial chicken and beef products made from meat substitutes. As will be described later on, Next Meats Co., Ltd. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On November 18, 2020, Paul Moody resigned from his position of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director.
 
Simultaneous to Paul Moody’s resignations, Ryo Shirai was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Hideyuki Sasaki as our Chief Operating Officer and Director, and Koichi Ishizuka as our Chief Financial Officer.
 
On January 8, 2021 our now former majority shareholder, Next Meats Co., Ltd., a Japan Company, along with our Board of Directors, took action to ratify, affirm, and approve a name change of the Company from Turnkey Solutions, Inc., to Next Meats Holdings, Inc. The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (“NVSOS”) to enact the name change with an effective date of January 19, 2021. This was previously disclosed in the Form 8-K we filed on January 25, 2021.
 
Also on January 8, 2021, our now former majority shareholder Next Meats Co., Ltd., along with our Board of Directors took action to ratify, affirm, and approve a change of the Company’s ticker symbol from TKSI to NXMH.
 
Pursuant to the above, the Company carried out a FINRA corporate action. As a result of the aforementioned actions the Company’s CUSIP number was changed from 90043H102 to 65345L 100. The change in CUSIP, name change, and symbol change were posted on the FINRA daily list on January 25, 2021 with a market effective date of January 26, 2021.
 
On January 28, 2021, Next Meats Co., Ltd., along with our Board of Directors, took action to ratify, affirm, and approve the issuance of 452,352,298 shares of restricted common stock to Next Meats Co., Ltd. The shares were issued for services rendered to the Company. 

On June 9, 2021 the Company entered into a “Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement” (referred to herein as “the Agreement”) with Next Meats Co., Ltd., a Japan Company. Pursuant to the Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement, effective on December 16, 2021, Next Meats Holdings, Inc. acquired Next Meats Co., Ltd. as a wholly owned subsidiary. Commensurate with this action, there was a conversion of the Next Meats Holdings, Inc. percentile share interest in exchange for the Company’s 100% share interest in Next Meats Co., Ltd. Immediately prior to the effective time, each (now former) shareholder of Next Meats Co., Ltd. cancelled and exchanged their percentile share interest in Next Meats Co., Ltd. for an equivalent percentile share interest in Next Meats Holdings, Inc. at a pro rata percentage. As a result of the Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement, we now own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Next Meats Co., Ltd., which constitutes 1,000 shares of common stock.

We believe that the aforementioned transaction(s) relating to the Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement described above constituted a tax-free organization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Full details of the Share Cancellation and Exchange Agreement are contained within our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 16, 2021.

Following the acquisition of Next Meats Co., Ltd. on December 16, 2021, we ceased to be a shell company. Currently, and going forward, we intend to act as a holding company for our subsidiaries which develop and sell alternative meat products, created from various meat substitutes.

On December 28, 2021, Ryo Shirai resigned as our Chief Executive Officer and was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Business Information
 
We share the same business plan as that of our subsidiaries and we also act as a holding company for our subsidiaries. Through Next Meats Co., Ltd., Next Meats USA, Inc., Next Meats HK Co. Limited, Next Meats (S) Pte. Ltd., and NextMeats France, we develop and sell alternative meat products, with ingredients derived from predominantly, plant based materials. For the purposes of the foregoing business plan, all references to “Next Meats”, Next Meats Co., Ltd.”, “NextMeats France”, “Next Meats USA”, “Next Meats HK”, “Next Meats (S) Pte. Ltd.”, or “the Company”, refer collectively to Next Meats Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted.
 
Our mission, or philosophy, is that “We Won’t Let Earth End”. Next Meats works to provide a solution to the climate crisis and food insecurity problems by distributing, what we believe to be, delicious alternative-meat products rooted in Japanese cuisine, worldwide. Next Meats is a food-tech venture founded in Tokyo, by people passionate about delivering a better future for our children. We strive to create tasty alternatives to your favorite dishes, without the same environmental impact of using meat. We believe in a more ecologically sustainable future for every person.
 
At present, our principal focus is on the creation of plant-based food products to replace traditional animal products, while retaining the taste and texture of the original.
 
At Next Meats, safety and quality are our top priorities. Many people imagine chemical additives when they hear the word “alternative meat”, but it is our intent to only use the minimum, necessary ingredients, and keep additives at a minimum or as a last option. We combine vegetable proteins such as soybeans and peas and mold them with heat and pressure to create a unique texture and flavor. We produce our products only in certified food factories. To ensure that our products are safe, we produce them in clean food factories certified by the Japan Food Safety Management Association (JFS), HALAL, etc., for thorough quality control. We are also exporting more and more of our products overseas as time progresses, and we believe part of the reason is that our products are highly valued for their quality and “Made in Japan” taste.
 
Below, pictured on the right, is the active production of one of several of our product offerings, NEXT Yakiniku, a meat alternative to skirt steak. Pictured on the left is our NEXT Yakiniku once cooked and prepared for consumption.
 

While we maintain rigorous safety and cleanliness standards for the factories that produce Next Meats products, it should be noted that we do not, at this time, directly manufacture any of our products. As a result of one of our collaborative agreements, the majority of our products are manufactured utilizing the facilities of Mama Foods Co., Ltd., while in other instances we use, and may continue to utilize, facilities of third party strategic partners to manufacture certain products (for example, the Next Patty is manufactured by one of these third parties). In the future, we may seek to manufacture our products internally, but at this time we have no plans to do so. We intend to maintain ongoing relationships and agreements with local manufacturers for as long as they remain certified by JFS, HALAL, etc. and meet our rigorous safety and cleanliness standards. From time to time we send out staff members into the facilities that manufacturer our products for ongoing inspections and observation.

Currently Available Products
 
The following list of products is not comprehensive, but it is a showcase of some of our most popular items:
 

1. | NEXT Burger 2.1- The NEXT Burger is a meat (plant-based) patty made by combining the proteins of peas and soybeans. In comparison to regular burgers, we believe the NEXT Burger to be very gentle on the body while retaining the taste of a traditional burger patty.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | NEXT Gyudon- Gyudon, also known as a beef bowl, is a Japanese dish traditionally consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi, soy sauce and mirin. The NEXT Gyudon is made from processed soybeans and natural seasonings, without using any animal ingredients and without adding chemical seasonings. The cholesterol in this product is almost zero and we believe it to be a far healthier option than a typical gyudon, while retaining all the flavor.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | NEXT Yakiniku- The world's first plant-based Yakiniku barbecue meats have two types, the Short-rib, and the Skirt-steak. Both are:
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
- Free of artificial additives
 - High in protein
 - No Cholesterol
 - Uses Non-GMO soy
 - Low in saturated fat
 
The textures slightly vary but they both have a non-intrusive, lightly sweet and savory flavor which makes it extremely versatile. The NEXT Yakinikus are excellent grilled and "topped on rice" or in a stir fry, or in tacos, and in an endless possibility of dishes.

4. | NEXT Chicken- The NEXT Chicken replicates the texture of chicken and is available in both original garlic herb roast as well as chicken tandoori flavors. Compared to chicken thighs, NEXT chicken has 1.1 times more protein (33.12g per pack), about 1/5 of fat (5.4g per pack), and does not contain cholesterol. It is made of 100% vegetable content, and is an ideal vegan alternative to chicken.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | NEXT Egg- The NEXT EGG is 100% plant based and is expected to procure the needs of the vegan population and people with egg allergies, who have, until now, had almost no commercial vegan egg options to choose from.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | NEXT Tuna- The NEXT Tuna is 100% botanical and low in fat cholesterol. It is available in a can and there is no need to drain oil or water. We believe it is ideal for hand-rolled sushi and pasta, as well as being placed on a salad or sandwiched with mayonnaise. In addition, since it can be stored at room temperature for a long period of time (2 years after manufacture date), it can be used as an emergency food, given its long shelf life. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | NEXT Milk- The NEXT Milk is a 100% plant based milk made with only germinated oats, and fresh water. There are no preservatives, artificial flavoring, vegetable oils or salt, in order to provide only the rich flavor of oats and nutrients. With a hint of natural sweetness, NEXT Milk is ideal to adding to coffee or for cooking as well.

The vegetable protein for the Next Yakiniku is formed in a twin-screw extruder, then dried, boiled, fried, and seasoned. Finally, it is heat sterilized and frozen. The Next Burger and Next Gyudon and Next Chicken also use processed soy that comes out the extruder but they are cooked differently afterwards.
 
The main ingredient for all products is soybeans, and different varieties of soybeans and production areas are used for different products to give them varying textures and colors. The products are all sold frozen with the exception of the canned Next Gyudon, and they are all classified as “processed soy products”. In some stores, depending on the results of the bacteria count test, the product can be sold in the chilled zone in the fridge (5℃).
 
Other than the main ingredient, soybeans, the other part of the product is the seasoning, such as yakiniku sauce, beef bowl sauce, and herb seasoning for chicken.
 
The below is included to provide a visual of some our current product offerings detailed above.
 

Trademarks
 
We have obtained trademarks within Japan for the names of our existing products. Any proposed or future products are also trademarked, or will likely be trademarked, within Japan or are pending receipt of such trademark rights within Japan. In Taiwan we have also trademarked our ‘NEXT Yakiniku’ product. Additionally, our name, ‘Next Meats’ is trademarked in the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan.
Future Products
 
Development of new products is ongoing, and in some instances may not be to the point where we can publicly announce our plans. We continually strive to create and sell new products, and we anticipate our product line will continue to expand and diversify in 2023 and the years to follow as our business expands and grows.
Distribution
 
At present, we distribute our products through several wholesale companies, while also selling directly through our website. The USA version of our website can be viewed at the following link: https://www.nextmeatsusa.com/. We have accounts with Kokubu and NIPPON ACCESS, two of the largest food wholesalers in Japan, and they distribute our products to restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country.

We have been, or will be, distributing our products in various countries through the efforts of our subsidiaries. Namely, Next Meats USA, Inc., Next Meats HK Co. Limited, Next Meats (S) Pte. Ltd., and NextMeats France will spearhead distribution of our products in the United States, China, Singapore, and France respectively. These strategically incorporated subsidiaries will also allow us to create regional hubs in these countries, through which, in the future, we may launch further expansion efforts into surrounding countries.
 
As a result of our wholesale and distribution channels mentioned above, Next Meats products are widely distributed in supermarkets and restaurant chains as an alternative meat brand. Notably, several of our food products can be found in Wayback Burgers’ Japanese Restaurant locations. These Wayback Burgers locations are owned and controlled by WB Burgers Asia, Inc. Koichi Ishizuka is the sole officer, director, and controlling shareholder of WB Burgers Asia, Inc.
 
Below are some of the various supermarkets and restaurants (this is not a full list) that our products can be found in.
 


Additionally, in Taiwan and Vietnam there are individuals (they are not employees, but they are business associates of our officers and directors) who act as local distributors and sell our products to distributors/retailers in each country, respectively. In Vietnam and Taiwan, we sell the TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) from Japan and conduct the final processing of our products locally. Further, in both Vietnam and Taiwan, the final processing is done at partner factories. In the future, we plan to establish official subsidiaries for each of these countries and transfer business operations directly to them. To date, we have incorporated subsidiaries in Japan, the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, and France, with future expansion efforts in development.
 
Pictured below is one of our scientists on staff developing and producing one of our various alternative meats products using the TVP method described above.
 


As part of our forward-looking plans, we are in the process of establishing additional global branches in China, India, Italy, Spain, and Russia. 
 
Marketing Strategy
 
At present, our marketing plan is comprised of daily posts and releases through various social networking platforms, SNS messaging, and we have also appeared at events throughout Japan, distributed press releases, and attempted to have our company featured on various news media. Whenever we release a new product, we also release an official press release and/or we hold a press conference in Japan. We have also created a television commercial, which can be viewed on our website. The commercial was originally created in Japanese, and has only aired on television in Japan thus far, but has also been translated into English and Chinese. It was, and is, our belief that creating and running a television commercial would help to differentiate us from many other startups who do not reach out to the general public through this medium. As our operations progress, our marketing initiatives will remain ongoing and we will continually seek to identify and explore new methods of increasing consumers’ awareness of our products.
Collaborative Efforts
 
On December 11, 2020, Next Meats Co., Ltd. entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Euglena Co., Ltd. with the intent to jointly develop artificial meat products containing Euglena. To date, this has resulted in the creation of “Next Yakiniku Euglena EX” which integrates the microalgae euglena into our Next Yakiniku product. We are currently working on developing a burger patty alongside Euglena Co., Ltd.
 
On December 28, 2020, Next Meats Co., Ltd. entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Toyota Tsusho Corporation to agree to consider this partnership with the aim of taking measures to make a new food culture permeate society and contribute to the achievement of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), by making use of each companies’ strengths in forming an ecosystem that expands the Japanese and overseas plant meat market and reinforces its value chain. Thus far, this has resulted in introductions to new retailers, assistance with our exporting plans to China (including introductions to factories in China), as well as the development of the “Menchikatsu” cutlet product which was released recently.
 
On May 5, 2021, Next Meats Co., Ltd. entered into a Joint Research Agreement with Nagaoka University of Technology. The research pertains to regulatory mechanisms of iron-binding protein gene expression in leguminosae plants. Leguminosae plants possess a gene that encodes iron-binding protein, but this gene is not expressed in the seeds, so plant-based meat made using seeds from leguminosae plants, like soybean, lack iron-binding proteins when compared to animal meats. One solution to this problem is the production of cultivars wherein iron-binding protein genes are expressed within the seeds; the elucidation and usage of epigenetic control mechanisms will be effective in modifying gene expression. Therefore, we will conduct fundamental research on the development of plant variant that can produce seeds that contain high levels of iron-binding protein through the usage of the plant epigenetics technology at the Nagaoka University of Technology.
 
On October 11, 2021, we, through our now wholly owned subsidiary Next Meats Co., Ltd., entered into and consummated a “Collaboration Agreement” with Dr. Foods Co., Ltd., a Japan company and wholly owned subsidiary of Dr. Foods, Inc., a Nevada Company, that shares common management with the Company, to co-develop new food products and subsequently offer them for sale. Dr. Foods Co., Ltd. operates in the “plant-based food” industry. It currently offers, and plans to continue to offer, amongst other things, artificial foie gras made from meat substitutes, and intends to offer, in the future, a diverse range of microalgae-based foods. 
 
The Collaboration Agreement with Dr. Foods, Inc. is for a period of two years, and may be renewed thereafter under the same terms for additional one-year terms unless terminated in writing, with three months’ notice, by either party. The Collaboration Agreement, amongst other things, details the terms and conditions by which Next Meats Co., Ltd. and Dr. Foods Co., Ltd. may co-develop, cooperate and contribute towards the development of new products and technologies. The specific allotment of tasks per project will be determined in writing by each party at the outset of collaborative efforts. Dr. Foods Co., Ltd. will primarily, although not exclusively, contribute to research and development, and Next Meats Co., Ltd. will primarily, although not exclusively, contribute to distribution of new products/technologies. Costs pursuant to the collaborative efforts of the partners, will be the respective responsibility of the party responsible for fulfilling such tasks.

On March 17, 2022, Next Meats Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of Next Meats Holdings, Inc. has agreed to conclude a business alliance agreement with Yakuodo Co., a subsidiary of Yakuodo Holdings, Inc. and as a part of this alliance, Yakuodo has agreed to purchase certain shares of Next Meats Holdings, Inc., to strengthen the relationship between the two companies. Moving forward, the two companies will consider the following possibilities for collaboration with a particular focus on utilization of data owned by Yakuodo, product development utilizing Yakuodo’s employee assets, and improvement of logistics efficiency. All such future plans have not been outlined with any further specificity at this time.
 
At this time, the majority of Next Meats’ products are manufactured at facilities owned by Mama Foods Co., Ltd. (“Mama Foods”), a Japan Company. Mama Foods is owned and controlled, at this time, by White Knight Co., Ltd., which in turn is owned and controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka.
 
Future Plans
 
We anticipate that continued development of new products will be an ongoing process. Simultaneously, we are focused on expanding our sales distribution channels, and issuing pertinent press releases while conducting media interviews. We are in the process of developing our subsidiaries which includes, in some cases, the preparation of specialized domestic products (which we are not yet ready to announce). Increasing production, and local distribution via our subsidiaries, will be a developing process going into the future, and we cannot forecast with any level of specificity, at this time, when such plans will be realized.
 
During 2023, we intend to begin the process of listing on the NASDAQ if our financial situation is conducive to such an effort. Further, we intend to increase our mass media exposure and have tentative plans to begin placing OOH (Out of Home) advertisements in strategic locations throughout Japan. In 2023 and beyond we tentatively intend to increase our overseas media and event exposure, but such efforts are speculative at present.
 
Government Regulations
 
The below does not extensively detail every law and regulation to which the Company may be subject to, but rather provides an overview of the kind of food safety standards to which our product(s) will be held.
 
The main law that governs food quality and integrity in Japan is the Food Sanitation Act ("FSA") and the law that comprehensively governs food labeling regulation is the Food Labeling Act.
 
The FSA regulates food quality and integrity by:
 
- Establishing standards and specifications for food, additives, apparatus, and food containers and packaging;
 - Providing for inspection to see whether the established standards are met;
 - Providing for hygiene management in the manufacture and sale of food; and
 - Requiring food businesses to be licensed.
 
Under the FSA, additives and foods containing additives must not be sold, or be produced, imported, processed, used, stored, or displayed for marketing purposes unless the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") has declared them as having no risk to human health after seeking the views of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council ("PAFSC"). In addition, it is not permissible to add any processing aids, vitamins, minerals, novel foods or nutritive substances to food unless they have been expressly declared by the MHLW as having no risk to human health.
 
The MHLW may establish specifications for methods of producing, processing, using, cooking, or preserving food or additives to be served to the public for marketing purposes ("Specifications"), or may establish standards for food ingredients or additives to be served to the public for marketing purposes ("Standards") pursuant to the FSA. Accordingly, where substances are allowed to be added to food, they may only be used within the limits expressly set by the Specifications and Standards.
 
Our Facilities
 
At present, our sole facilities are our research lab in Nagaoka, Niigata, which opened in February of 2021 and our Tokyo offices, both of which are rented by Next Meats Co., Ltd. from an unrelated third party at a price of 84,000 JPY per month and 426,662 JPY per month, respectively. Our Nagaoka Research Lab is solely used for research activities and does not include a “production line”. The lab is 75 square meters in size and has seven employees. The research conducted here is led by Doctors of microbiology, life sciences, and engineering. Our recent research topics include: the incorporation of microorganisms in raw materials and/or end products, fermentation technology, the use of epigenetics on raw materials, research on new varieties of plants, and research on machinery used in the manufacturing process.
 

We had previously developed plans to construct our own NEXT factory dedicated to alternative protein/product development. It was to include sustainable technologies and DX Systems (HVAC air conditioning unit). However, during this fiscal year, we have determined to put such plans on indefinite hiatus given management’s belief that such an endeavor would result in a large capital expenditure. Management believes it can fulfill its current and anticipated future levels of production with current manufacturers.
 
Employees

Competition
 
The alternative meat industry is highly competitive, with a major market share held by prominent companies, such as Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes. In 2019, Beyond Meat, which manufactures the plant-based Beyond Burger, went public at a valuation of almost $1.5B. Beyond Meat began offering direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales in August 2020 and announced partnerships with Yum! Brands and McDonald’s in 2021.
 
In Japan, there are also several prominent alternative-meat companies which we consider to be our direct competitors including, but not necessarily limited to, Marukome Co., Ltd., Maisen Fine Foods Co., and Kabaya Foods Corporation. Marukome Co., Ltd, one of Japan’s oldest and top miso paste producers, launched their Daizu Labo (Soybean Laboratories) brand, which features over 30 soy-based substitutes for animal products, eight advertised as ‘meat’ (ready to eat, dried, and frozen). Maisen Fine Foods Co., gradually expanded its business from organic brown rice to rice-based and allergy-friendly food products. In 2016, they launched a series of gluten-free soybean and rice-based meat products. Kabaya Foods Corporation, a confectionery company founded in 1946, launched a soy-based jerky in 2018 with the slogan “a new era of snack is coming.”
 
Despite these, and other, competitors, we believe that we have significant competitive strengths which poise Next Meats to become a prominent market participant in the alternative food industry going forward.
