Item 1. Business
General Overview
 
The Company was established on December 1, 2016 in Nevada, USA. On September 14, 2018, the Company and Arcus Mining Holdings Limited (“Arcus”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated September 14, 2018 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), with Chi Kin Loo, Billion Plus Limited, First Fortune Investment Limited, Great Win Limited and Master Value Holdings Limited (the "Selling Stockholders"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell all of their ordinary shares of Arcus to the Company in exchange for an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Arcus, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is engaged in the exploration, mining, processing and sale of fluorite in Mongolia.
 
Arcus currently owns three fluorite projects through its subsidiaries. Its official mining licenses in Mongolia are shown below:

According to the staged exploration results, there are abundant resources as well as a large potential to expand the resource base of the mines, laying a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the Company.
 
Arcus strove to create more value through efficiency in mining. The initial expected annual production capacity of fluorite ("CaF2") for 2019 and 2020 is described below:
 

Type | Metallurgical Grade | Acid Grade 
---------------------------+------------------------------+------------
CaF2 Content | 80% to 90% | 97% 
Estimated Capacity in 2019 | 9,000 tons annual production | 13,000 tons
Estimated Capacity in 2020 | 9,000 tons annual production | 59,000 tons
Final Product | Granule/Powder | Powder 

 
Arcus intends to start producing 97% Acid Grade powder products in 2019. 
 
Nevertheless, there are several areas where Arcus expects to outperform the market: 
 

· | Abundant fluorite resources for a long-term sustainable business; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Experience in mine construction, mining and marketing of fluorite;

 
In summary, the Company intends to make full use of Mongolia's fluorite resource advantages and market under the guidance of our experienced management team.
 
Arcus Company Background
 
The founders and the management of Arcus have extensive experience in the mining industry in Africa, China, Russia and Mongolia. Their industrial experience includes exploration, mining and mineral investment. With extensive experience in the manufacture and sale of fluorite and related products, Arcus believes the Company will be able to produce the raw material needed for various high standard industrial products, including the manufacture of acid-grade fluorite, metallurgical grade fluorite and more.
 
To meet ever-changing demands from customers, Arcus established a management team comprised of several experienced persons in the industry, as well as financial and marketing experts from international and local markets. The mines use advanced production equipment to produce high-quality products for the market. 
 
In 2014, the Mongolian Parliament waived several restrictions on issuing new minerals exploration licenses and introduced a series of new regulations to encourage foreign investments in the Mongolian mining sector. Arcus is well positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in this promising business environment.
 
Arcus Company Structure
 
Arcus indirectly holds three fluorite projects in Mongolia through its wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, namely Best Metro (Hong Kong) Limited, China Aim (Hong Kong) Limited, which in turn wholly own Mongolian based fluorite mining companies Khan Shashir LLC ("Khan Shashir"), Shek Hung Gold LLC ("Shek Hung") respectively. Arcus Hong Kong Limited wholly own the PRC based Best Metro Import & Export Trading (Inner Mongolia) Limited as a trading arm.
 
The demand for metallurgical grade fluorite in China and other Asian countries currently exceeds supply, and current market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, creating excellent opportunities for the Company. Inherent uncertainties in the mining industry as well as the changing legal and political environment in Mongolia potentially bring additional business risks, as detailed under “Risk Factors” below.

Shek Hung currently owns a project called Altan Ovoo, while Khan Shashir owns the mines Oosmonskogo 1 and Oosmonskogo 2.
 
Mining Licenses
 
The three fluorite projects in Mongolia are Altan Ovoo ("Mine A"), Oosmonskogo 1 ("Mine B") and Oosmonskogo 2 ("Mine C"). 
 
The three projects have all been issued official mining licenses. The mining licenses allow the right to conduct mining activities throughout the license areas and to construct structures within the license areas that are related to its mining activities.
 
Mine A is located in Uul-Bayan soum, Sukhbaatar province, 530 kilometers ("km") from Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Mine A's mining license, reference number MV-009918, is valid until December 29, 2034. Mine A covers an area of 39.35 hectares (97.24 acres).
 
Mine B is located in the Bayan-Ovoo soum, Khentii province, 440 km from Ulaanbaatar. Mine B's license, reference number MV-016819, is valid until April 28, 2041. Mine B covers an area of 98.37 hectares (243.08 acres).
 
Mine C is adjacent to Mine B. Mine C's license, reference number MV-017305, is valid until April 23, 2043. Mine C covers an area of 300.96 hectares (743.59 acres).

The location map of Mines A, B and C are shown below: Resources and Reserves 
After years of exploration, a significant potential for high grade fluorite resources for Mine A and Mine B has been positively demonstrated.
 
The historic exploration of Mine A and Mine B can be divided into three phrases:
 

· | An investigation conducted by the former Soviet Union governmental agencies in the last century; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | An investigation conducted by an independent consultant from the United States in 2012; and 
· | An investigation conducted by SRK Consulting in 2014, a leading mining consulting services provider.

 
Arcus' own geological team will search for other resources through continued exploration in the areas surrounding existing deposits. 
 
Mine A
 
Phase 1: Investigation conducted by former Soviet Union government agencies in 1980’s
 
The former Soviet Union politically governed Mongolia between 1925 and 1991. Its governmental agencies performed the first systematic exploration on Mine A between 1985 and 1987. Only one vein was located, east-trending with a strike length of 600 to 700 meters. The major work performed included drilling and digging six trenches three to four meters deep along the vein.
 
According to a survey report stored at the Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia prepared by the former Soviet Union government agencies, Mine A has inferred resources of 6.35 million tons with an average of 30% CaF2.
 


7

 
Phase 2: Investigation conducted by an independent surveyor in 2012
 
Since the date of the report by the Soviet Union governmental agencies, 27 new holes were drilled (2,916 m) underneath the trenches excavated in the 1980s to investigate the resource in Mine A. Most holes were drilled vertically or at an angle of 60° to the north, as the vein dips approximately 45° to the south.
 
Based on the samples obtained from the core holes drilled and historical surface trench assays, the independent United States explorer estimated an inferred resource of approximately 6.18 million tons with an average grade of 30% CaF2 for Mine A, very similar to the estimation by the Soviets.
 
Phase 3: Investigation conducted by SRK Consulting
 
Considering the advice from the independent explorer on the possibility of re-drilling some core holes to increase output of Mine A and Mine B, Arcus formally engaged SRK Consulting to perform a formal survey on both mines. 
 
In late 2014, a specialist from SRK Consulting visited both Mine A and Mine B. SRK Consulting collected 43 extra drill core samples in Mine A during its visit. Analysis performed on data from these samples allowed SRK Consulting to define an indicated resource for Mine A of approximately 1.95 million tons and an inferred resource of around 2.56 million tons with an average CaF2 content of 34%. This is substantially lower than the historic figures but at a better grade. In addition, more confidence can be placed in these resource figures as they were obtained in accordance with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (“JORC Code”). (The JORC Code is the Australasian code for reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves. It is a professional code of practice that sets minimum standards for public reporting of minerals exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves.)
 
Mine B
 
Phase 1: Investigation conducted by former Soviet Union government agencies in 1930s to 1950s
 
Former Soviet Union governmental agencies performed the first systemic exploration on Mine B in 1937 and continued until approximately 1950. The main vein located was north-striking. It was traced by trenching and defined to be at least 400 meters in length in the 1940’s.
 
Major work performed in Phase 1 included:
 

1. | Over 160 trenches dug along the vein surface, which are now mostly deteriorated;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Over 35 vertical drill holes; and 
3. | A 35-meter underground tunnel along the main vein zone. 

 
According to a survey report stored at the Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia, prepared by the former Soviet Union governmental agencies, Mine B has an inferred resource of 0.52 million tons with an average of 80% CaF2 content in 1950.
 
Survey Report for Mine B provided by the Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia
 
A Russian geological investigation report, including a mineral estimation, was produced by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (“USSR”) in 1951. The mineral estimation was conducted in accordance with Soviet standards, and the results are presented in the table below.

Phase 2: Investigation conducted by an independent surveyor in 2012The Company has drilled 9 vertical core holes with an aggregate length of 877 meters in 2011 to update information on Mine B. Based on the samples obtained from the 9 vertical core holes drilled and assays of 4 drill hole cores in the Soviet Union period, the independent surveyor estimated an inferred resource of approximately 2.35 million tons with an average grade of 43% CaF2 of Mine B.

Phrase 3: Investigation conducted by SRK Consulting

During the site visit to Mine B, the specialist consultant from SRK Consulting observed that most of the fluorite ores in Mine B have a grade of more than 90% CaF2 and could be used for ornamental and lapidary purposes. 
 
Comparing the report by the former Soviet Union with the data from 2012, it was concluded that the resource figure of the Soviet report was too low. According to SRK Consulting, Mine B has an Indicated Resource of 0.43 million tons and an Inferred Resource of around 0.20 million tons. Based on the samples taken by SRK Consulting, the average in situ grade CaF2 is 67%.
 
Mine C
 
No exploration or resource estimate has been done on Mine C, but initial surface investigations suggest that the resource of Mine B may extend onto the license of Mine C.
 
Future development
 
The Company is planning to continue with a second round of exploration in Mine A, Mine B and Mine C. The primary objective would be to gain a better understanding of the geological structure to assist in mine planning and to upgrade the identified inferred resource to the indicated resource category.
 
According to SRK Consulting, the drill holes in Mine A do not provide consistent coverage of all areas. Therefore, another round of exploration would allow a more detailed understanding of the resource allocation and help upgrade much of the inferred resource into the indicated resource category. This will be followed by a pre-feasibility study at Mine A and by full feasibility studies for Mine A and Mine B. These feasibility studies will be conducted by Arcus' experienced team, assisted by external specialist consultants where necessary.

Mine C is adjacent to Mine B, and given the large cover area of Mine C, we are optimistic regarding the resources of Mine C. Based on preliminary estimates by the geologists, it is possible that the resource of Mine C could be greater than that of Mine B. Conducting a thorough exploration of the resource will allow better planning on mining Mine C and ensure sustainability of the Company’s growth.
 
Operations
 
Currently, Mine B is in trial production in 2018 and both Mine B and Mine A is expected to be put into operation in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
 
There are two types of products available from Mine B, metallurgical and acid grade fluorite. Metallurgical grade fluorite is sold mainly to steel manufacturers for use as flux in steel production. Acid grade fluorite which is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid, a feedstock for many different chemical processes.
Workflow of Operations
 
The formal operation of the Company involves several steps as shown below: 
 

Mine Preparation
 
Preparing a mine involves investigation, exploration, evaluation and the construction of necessary infrastructures and utilities facilities, among other tasks.
 
Both Mine A and Mine B are now equipped with the necessary facilities, but the infrastructure in Mine B is more comprehensive. The basic facilities information of Mine A and Mine B are shown below:

 | Mine A | Mine B 
----------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------
Water Resources | Drilled water wells | Drilled water wells 
Electricity Resources | Local wind turbine generators | Bayan-Ovoo soum electrical power grid
Mining Method | Open pit mining | Underground mining 
Shafts | Not applicable | 4 in production 


10

Water Resources
 
It is probable that there is sufficient water from drilled wells for mining and processing operations in Mine A and Mine B. Several such wells have been completed at both Mine A and Mine B. All the water will be recycled, but in the dry climate, evaporation is high.
Electricity Resources
 
Mine B is currently connected to the Bayan-Ovoo soum electrical power grid. Power generation in Mine A is currently supported by a set of wind turbines. Both Mine A and Mine B have sufficient power to meet daily usage, and each has two sets of contingent diesel generators.
Infrastructures
 
At Mine B, the construction of offices, living quarters and explosive stores have been completed. Of the four shafts built in Mine B, one shaft has been excavated with a 150 meter long development drive in the fluorite ore. Annual crude ore production is estimated to be 8,000 tons. The second shaft, excavated with a 180 meter long development, is configured with an annual crude ore production of 6,000 tons. The third shaft has been configured with an annual crude ore production of 4,000 tons. The remaining shaft has an annual crude ore production of 12,000 tons. Construction on excavating an underground tunnel to connect the four shafts is in progress which the completion date of works is tentatively scheduled in 2019. 
 
Mining activities are halted for the winter break, which takes place between January and March every year. Since mining activities are conducted underground, which is more dependent on the weather condition, the winter break for the mining activities is one month longer than the winter break for the production line. Formal mining is expected to commence in 2019.
 
Mine A is planned as an open pit mine because the mineralization outcrops on the surface are relatively easy to begin mining. Four temporary offices and storage containers have been set up at Mine A. Since the resource in Mine A is large, management plans to develop Mine A in stages. Mining of the open pit is expected to commence in 2019, while the deeper ores will be subjected to further exploration.
 
Mine A is planned to produce fluorite powder. The appropriate processing plant, with sufficient capacity, will be installed based on the production tests that are currently being conducted. Management is optimistic that mining and processing will be commenced in 2019, and that installation of the processing plant will be completed in 2020, as well, given market demand and our cash flow position. Each production line is configured for a full production of 80,000 tons of fluorite powder annually.
 
Mining
 
Mine A is not yet in production, but it is expected that a flotation refining procedure will be utilized. The operations described below currently apply only to Mine B but can serve as a general reference regarding the future production of Mine A. Starting from year 2019, we will outsource the mining activities to subcontractors.
Refining
 
The Company will not outsource its core fluorite processing to third parties. Major fluorite processing of metallurgical grade fluorite includes gravity separation, which refines the fluorite granules, followed by sorting the granules by sizes in accordance with a customer’s needs. 

11

 
The major machines employed in Mine B are the shakers and the jiggers. A jigger is a vertical container where a pulsing action divides ores into different layers according to their densities. When sorted by a shaker, ore is placed on a horizontal water surface, and the shaker applies longitudinal forces. As ores of different densities respond to longitudinal forces, they are sorted accordingly. Both shakers and jiggers are common tools in conducting gravity selection, but jiggers mainly divide coarse ores into different size groups (30 mm - 80 mm) and shakers mainly refine smaller ores (3 mm – 10 mm or 1 mm – 3 mm).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
From 2015 throughout 2018, Arcus ran trial production and planned to sell metallurgical grade fluorite at site. In 2019, the Company intends to further expand its sales. Some of the ultimate target customers include Korean steel manufactures.
Customers
 
The Company intends to develop a pool of customers to reduce its distribution risk. The Company’s targeted customer base is set forth below:
 

· | Korean steel manufacturers, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Chinese steel manufacturers. 
· | Other foreign steel manufacturers (e.g., Japanese, Indian, American, etc.).
· | Online sales platforms. 
· | Fluorochemical companies, mainly in China due to large demand. 
· | Chinese and other foreign aluminum manufacturers. 

The Market for Fluorite in Mongolia
 
Fluorite and its Applications
 
Fluorite, commercially termed as fluorspar, is a transparent halide mineral of various colors, composed primarily of calcium fluoride (CaF2). Fluorite is the dominant source for the chemical element fluorine. Due to its unique chemical properties, fluorine is largely irreplaceable in its use. The major applications of fluorite and the corresponding requirement of content percentage are summarized below:

12

 


Most of the world demand for fluorite is for acid-grade fluorite, which is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid, a feedstock for many different chemical processes. The second greatest demand is for metallurgical grade fluorite, used as flux in steel and aluminum production. A small portion is produced as ceramic grade fluorite for the manufacture of ceramics and enamels due to the high content percentage requirement.
