ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview

Panamera Holdings Corporation (“Panamera” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 20, 2014 as Panamera Healthcare Corporation. On October 21, 2021, we changed our name to Panamera Holdings Corporation. Prior management intended to offer management and consulting services to healthcare organizations but current management have redirected our efforts now to pursuing business opportunities including but not limited to the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. 
Our Current Business

We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established operating business entities to merge with or to acquire with our primary emphasis in the environmental services industry, emerging innovative technologies and individual health choices led by innovation with integration. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary, or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge with us. We have begun negotiations but not entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.

Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our Company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.

Management of our Company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTC Markets, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States’ capital market.

We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our officers and directors will continue to manage the Company; however, any potential business combination candidate may require a change of management as a condition of the combination.

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K.

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our Company may be scarce and or we may be unable to participate in an opportunity of our choosing. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.

Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on a company controlled by one of our directors to provide financial contributions and services to keep the Company operating. Further, we believe that our Company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective business combination candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
