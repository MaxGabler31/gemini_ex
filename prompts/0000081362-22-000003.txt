Item 1.Business.
General Description 
The Company was organized in 1918, incorporated as a Pennsylvania
business corporation in 1930, and in August 2019 
completed the Combination with Houghton to form Quaker Houghton.
Quaker Houghton is the global leader in industrial process 
fluids.
With a presence around the world, includi
ng operations in over 25 countries, the Company’s
customers include thousands of 
the world’s most advanced and specialized
steel, aluminum, automotive, aerospace, offshore, can,
mining, and metalworking 
companies.
Quaker Houghton develops, produces, and markets a broad range of formulated
chemical specialty products and offers 
chemical management services (which we refer to as “Fluidcare
TM
”) for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications 
throughout its four segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa
(“EMEA”); Asia/Pacific; and Global Specialty Businesses. 
The major product lines of Quaker Houghton include metal removal fluids,
cleaning fluids, corrosion inhibitors, metal drawing 
and forming fluids, die cast mold releases, heat treatment and quenchants,
metal forging fluids, hydraulic fluids, specialty greases, 
offshore sub-sea energy control fluids, rolling
lubricants, rod and wire drawing fluids and surface treatment chemicals.
The following 
are the respective contributions to consolidated net sales of each of our principal
product lines representing more than 10% of 
consolidated net sales for any of the past three years based on the Company’s
current product line segmentation:

Sales Revenue 
A substantial portion of the Company’s
sales worldwide are made directly through its own employees and its Fluidcare
TM
programs, with the balance sold through distributors and agents.
The Company’s employees typically
visit the plants of customers 
regularly, work on
site, and through training and experience, identify production needs which can be resolved
or otherwise addressed 
either by utilizing the Company’s existing
products or by applying new formulations developed in its laboratories. 
As part of the Company’s Fluidcare
TM

business, certain third-party product sales to customers are managed by the
Company.
Where the Company acts as principal, revenues are recognized on
a gross reporting basis at the selling price negotiated with its 
customers.
Where the Company acts as an agent for its customers, revenue is recognized on
a net reporting basis at the amount of the 
administrative fee earned by the Company for ordering the goods.
See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 
of this Report. 
Competition 
The specialty chemical industry comprises a number of companies similar in
size to the Company, as well
as companies larger 
and smaller than Quaker Houghton.
The Company cannot readily determine its precise competitive position
in every industry it 
serves.
However, the Company estimates it holds a leading
global position in the market for industrial process fluids including 
significant global positions in the markets for process fluids in portions of
the automotive and industrial markets, and a leading 
position in the market for process fluids to produce sheet steel and aluminum.
The offerings of many of the Company’s
competitors 
differ from those of Quaker Houghton; some offer
a broad portfolio of fluids, including general lubricants, while others have more 
specialized product ranges.
All competitors provide different levels of technical
services to individual customers.
Competition in the 
industry is based primarily on the ability to supply products that meet the needs of
the customer and provide technical services and 
laboratory assistance to the customer, and
to a lesser extent, on price. 
Major Customers and Markets 
In 2021, Quaker Houghton’s
five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions
with semi-autonomous 
purchasing authority) accounted for approximately 10% of
consolidated net sales, with its largest customer accounting for 
approximately 3% of consolidated net sales.
A significant portion of the Company’s
revenues are realized from the sale of process 
fluids and services to manufacturers of steel, aluminum, automobiles,
aircraft, industrial equipment, and durable goods and, therefore, 
Quaker Houghton is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced
by these manufacturers and their customers.

  3 
The Company’s financial
performance is generally correlated to the volume of global production within
the industries it serves, rather 
than directly related to the financial performance of its customers.
Furthermore, steel and aluminum customers typically have limited 
manufacturing locations compared to metalworking customers and
generally use higher volumes of products at a single location. 
Raw Materials
Quaker Houghton uses approximately 3,000
raw materials, including animal fats, vegetable oils, mineral oils, oleochemicals, 
ethylene, solvents, surfactant agents, various chemical compounds
that act as additives to our base formulations, and a wide variety of 
other organic and inorganic compounds and
various derivatives of the foregoing.
The price of mineral oil and its derivatives can be 
affected by the price of crude oil and industry refining
capacity.
Animal fat and vegetable oil prices, as well as the prices of other raw 
materials, are impacted by their own unique supply and demand factors,
and by biodiesel consumption which is affected by the price 
of crude oil.
Accordingly, significant fluctuations
in the price of crude oil can have a material impact on the cost of these raw 
materials.
In addition, many of the raw materials used by Quaker Houghton are
commodity chemicals which can experience 
significant price volatility.
As experienced during 2021, the Company’s
earnings have been and could continue to be affected by 
market changes in raw material prices.
Reference is made to the disclosure contained in Item 7A of this Report. 
Patents and Trademarks 
Quaker Houghton has a limited number of patents and patent applications including
patents issued, applied for, or acquired in the 
U.S. and in various foreign countries, some of which may prove to be material
to its business, with the earliest patent expiry in 2024.
The Company principally relies on its proprietary formulae and its applications
know-how and experience to meet customer needs.
Quaker Houghton products are identified by numerous trademarks that
are registered throughout its marketing area. 
Research and Development—Laboratories 
The Company maintains approximately thirty separate laboratory
facilities worldwide that are primarily devoted to applied 
research and development.
In addition, the Company maintains quality control labs at each of its manufacturing
facilities.
Quaker 
Houghton research and development is directed primarily
toward applied technology since the nature of the Company’s
business 
requires continual modification and improvement of formulations to provide
specialty chemicals to satisfy customer requirements.
If 
problems are encountered which cannot be resolved by local laboratories,
the problem is referred to one of our ten principal 
laboratories, located in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania; Aurora, Illinois; Santa Fe Springs, California; 
Uithoorn, the Netherlands; Coventry,
United Kingdom; Dortmund, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Turin,
Italy or Qingpu, China. 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Research and development expenses during the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $44.9 million, $40.0 million and
$32.1 million, respectively. 
Recent Acquisition Activity 
The Company has completed several recent acquisitions that expand its strategic product
offerings and increase the Company's 
presence in its core industries.
The Company's 2021 and 2022 acquisitions consist of:
●

Impact of COVID-19 
The global outbreak of COVID-19, and its variants, has negatively impacted
all locations where the Company does business.
Although the Company has now operated in this COVID-19 environment
for almost two years, the full extent of the outbreak and 
related business impacts continue to remain uncertain and volatile.
This outbreak has significantly disrupted the operations of the 
Company and those of its suppliers and customers.
Management continues to monitor the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic
is 
having on the Company,
the overall specialty chemical industry,
and the economies and markets in which the Company operates. 
Regulatory Matters 
In order to facilitate compliance
with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations relating
to occupational health 
and safety and protection of the environment, the Company has an ongoing
program of site assessment for the purpose of identifying 
capital expenditures or other actions that may be necessary to comply with
such requirements.
The program includes periodic 
inspections of each facility by the Company and/or independent
experts, as well as ongoing inspections and training by on-site 
personnel.
Such inspections address operational matters, record keeping, reporting requirements
and capital improvements.
Capital 
expenditures directed solely or primarily to regulatory compliance amounted
to approximately $4.2
million, $3.7 million and $4.4 
million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. 
Company Segmentation 
The Company’s operating
segments, which are consistent with its reportable segments, reflect the structure of the
Company’s 
internal organization, the method by which the Company’s
resources are allocated and the manner by which the chief operating 
decision maker assesses the Company’s
performance.
The Company has four reportable segments: (i) Americas; (ii) EMEA; (iii) 
Asia/Pacific; and (iv) Global Specialty Businesses.
See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 
Non-U.S. Activities 
Since significant revenues and earnings are generated by non-U.S. operations,
the Company’s financial results are
affected by 
currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the
euro, the British pound sterling, the Brazilian real, the Mexican 
peso, the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee, and the impact of those currency
fluctuations on the underlying economies.
Reference is made to (i) the foreign exchange risk information
contained in Item 7A of this Report, (ii) the geographic information in 
Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 of this Report, and (iii) information regarding risks attendant 
to foreign operations included in Item 1A of this Report. 
Number of Employees 
On December 31, 2021, Quaker Houghton had approximately 4,700
full-time employees globally of whom approximately 1,200 
were employed by the parent company and its U.S. subsidiaries, and approximately
3,500 were employed by its non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Associated companies of Quaker Houghton (in which it owns 50% or less and has
significant influence) employed approximately 600 
people on December 31, 2021.

Sustainability Report
We report our
progress on Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) milestones in our
sustainability report, which is 
published annually and is available free of charge on our corporate
website at home.quakerhoughton.com/sustainability.
The 
Company’s 2020 Sustainability
Report reflects the most recent available data on a variety of topics, including
specific information 


  5 
relating to the Company’s:
(i) environmental footprint and climate change commitments;
(ii) diversity initiatives; (iii) safety initiatives 
and performance;
and (iv) training courses our employees have completed.
Information in these sustainability reports and on our 
website are not incorporated by reference in this Report and, accordingly,

Environmental Strategy
In 2020, we established the Board Sustainability Committee, which has specific
responsibility to assist the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”) in its assessment, evaluation, and oversight of the Company’s
sustainability programs and initiatives pertaining to the 
Company’s business, operations,
and employees.
In formulating our environmental strategy,
our Executive Leadership Team
(“ELT”) 
and Board consider certain risks and uncertainties that may materially impact
our financial condition and results of operations.
These 
risks and uncertainties are further described in Item 1A of this Report. 
In 2021, we set a target to achieve carbon neutrality in our global
operations by 2030 and net zero emissions across our entire 
value chain by 2050.
The Company established 15 long-term goals,
based on the results of the Company's 2020 materiality 
assessment, which was completed with input from customers, investors, suppliers,
and internal stakeholders.
Our 15 long-term goals 
are closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
We also identified short
-
and medium-term milestones 
that may help support the achievement of our 2030 targets.
Talent
Management and Retention 
Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our continued
success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across 
the organization.
Our ELT
and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating
an 
environment where employees want to show up to work and do great
things together.
To achieve sustained high performance, 
management invests in the development, safety,
and wellbeing of our employees.
Among other metrics, we measure training hours, 
turnover, time to hire, and diversity hiring
to assess our progress in these areas.
Additionally, we
regularly evaluate our compensation and benefits packages
for our employees, including health and wellness 
benefits, paid-time off policies, monetary compensation,
and educational reimbursements, to ensure that our total compensation and 
benefits packages are aligned with our business strategy,
organizational culture, and diversity and inclusion philosophy
while ensuring 
that we remain competitive in the markets we serve while following
local and statutory wage and benefits laws and guidelines.
Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion 
As a global company,
we want to build an organization that is inclusive of all people and representative of
the communities in 
which we operate.
Quaker Houghton provides equal employment opportunities and does not discriminate
based on age, ethnicity, 
gender identity,
disability / medical, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
We believe that diversity and
inclusion are embodied by 
having working norms and cultural familiarities whereby employees
feel included, engaged, and rewarded, regardless of their 
background or where they sit in the organization. 
Inclusion and diversity begin with the Board and ELT.
The Board is comprised of twelve individuals with diverse experience and 
credentials, selected for their business acumen and ability to challenge and add
value to management.
Our current Board composition 
includes two female and four racially diverse directors out of a total of
twelve directors.
For additional information on the Company’s 
leadership, refer to Item 4(a) Information about our Executive Officers
and Item 10.
Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate 
Governance. 
We published
our workforce demographics in our Sustainability Report.
By publicly disclosing our workforce demographics, we 
increase transparency in the composition of our workforce as well as facilitate accountability
in achieving progress in our diversity 
goals, including ensuring that diverse candidates are actively considered
for roles throughout the organization.
Workplac
e
Safety 
We are committed
to maintaining a strong safety culture and to emphasizing the importance of
our employees’ role in identifying, 
mitigating and communicating safety risks.
We maintain policies and
operational practices that communicate a culture where all 
levels of employees are responsible for safety.
We believe that
the achievement of superior safety performance is both an important 
short-term and long-term strategic goal in managing our operations.
We emphasize ten
“lifesaving” rules which make a significant 
difference in preventing serious injuries and fatalities.
We also require
all employees to regularly complete safety training.
Additionally, our
ELT is closely involved
in our safety programs and conducts regular reviews of safety performance
metrics and 
reviews the Company’s safety
performance during Company-wide meetings.

  6 
Factors that May Affect Our Future Results 
(Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995) 
Certain information included in this Report and other materials filed or
to be filed by Quaker Chemical Corporation with the SEC, 
as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made
or to be made by us, contain or may contain 
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to 
historical or current facts.
We have based
these forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the potential
effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain constraints on the Company’s
business, results of operations, and financial condition, 
our expectation that we will maintain sufficient liquidity and
remediate any of our material weaknesses in internal control over 
financial reporting, and statements regarding the impact of increased
raw material costs and pricing initiatives on our current 
expectations about future events.
These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to
our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, 
anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations, future
performance, and business, including: 

• 

the potential benefits of the Combination and other acquisitions; 

• 

the impacts on our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and
any projected global economic rebound or 
anticipated positive results due to Company actions taken in response; 
• 
cost increases in prices of raw materials and the impacts of constraints and
disruptions in the global supply chain;

• 

our current and future results and plans including our sustainability goals
;
and 

• 

statements that include the words “may,”
“could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” 
“intend,” “plan” or similar expressions. 
Such statements include information relating to current and future business activities,
operational matters, capital spending, and 
financing sources.
From time to time, forward-looking statements are also included in the Company’s
other periodic reports on Forms 
10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, press releases, and other materials released to,
or statements made to, the public. 
Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Report, in the Company’s
Annual Report to Shareholders for 2021 and in any 
other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.
This can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence 
of known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Many factors discussed in this Report will be important in determining our future 
performance.
Consequently, actual results may
differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward-looking 
statements. 
We undertake
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise.
However, any further disclosures made on
related subjects in the Company’s subsequent
reports on Forms 10-K, 
10-Q, 8-K and other related filings should be consulted.
A major risk is that demand for the Company’s
products and services is 
largely derived from the demand for our customers’ products, which
subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a 
customer’s business and unanticipated customer production
slowdowns and shutdowns, including as is currently being experienced by 
many automotive industry companies as a result of supply chain disruption.
Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not 
limited to, the primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including actions taken in response to the pandemic by 
various governments, which could exacerbate
some or all of the other risks and uncertainties faced by the Company,
as well as the 
potential for significant increases in raw material costs, supply chain
disruptions, customer financial instability,
worldwide economic 
and political disruptions such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine
,
foreign currency fluctuations, significant changes in 
applicable tax rates and regulations, future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence.
Furthermore, the Company is subject to the 
same business cycles as those experienced by our customers in the steel, automobile,
aircraft, industrial equipment, and durable goods 
industries.
The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on,
among other things, the extent and duration of the 
pandemic, the severity of the disease and the number of people infected
with the virus including new variants, the continued 
uncertainty regarding global availability,
administration, acceptance and long-term efficacy
of vaccines, or other treatments for 
COVID-19 or its variants, the longer-term effects on the
economy of the pandemic, including the resulting market volatility,
and by 
the measures taken by governmental authorities and other third parties restricting
day-to-day life and business operations and the 
length of time that such measures remain in place, as well as laws and other
governmental programs implemented to address the 
pandemic or assist impacted businesses, such as fiscal stimulus and other legislation
designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.
Other factors could also adversely affect us, including those related
to the Combination and other acquisitions and the integration of 
acquired businesses.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions about the Company and its 
operations that are subject to change based on various important factors,
some of which are beyond our control.
These risks, 
uncertainties, and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business
could cause our actual results to differ materially from 
expected and historical results.
Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements.
For more information regarding these 
risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face,
refer to the Risk Factors section, which appears in Item 1A of 
this Report and in our quarterly and other reports filed from time to time
with the SEC.

the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
