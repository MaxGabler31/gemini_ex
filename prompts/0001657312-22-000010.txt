Item 1.    Business
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Our product candidate, ensifentrine, is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase (“PDE”) 3 and PDE4 enzymes, which is designed to act as both a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory agent. 
Initially, we are developing inhaled ensifentrine for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), a common, chronic, progressive, and life-threatening respiratory disease without a cure. If successfully developed, ensifentrine would be the first therapeutic with a novel mode of action for COPD in over a decade.
During 2021, we made substantial progress in our Phase 3 ENHANCE (“Ensifentrine as a Novel inHAled Nebulized COPD thErapy”) clinical program. Patient enrollment completed in the 48-week subset of the ENHANCE-1 trial in December 2021 and in the ENHANCE-2 trial in January 2022. Complete enrollment in the 24-week subset of ENHANCE-1 is expected around the end of the second quarter of 2022. We expect to report top-line data from ENHANCE-2 in the third quarter of 2022 and from ENHANCE-1 around the end of 2022. Conditional upon positive results, we intend to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the first half of 2023. 
If approved, we intend to commercialize inhaled ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of COPD via a standard jet nebulizer in the United States (“US”). Outside the US, we intend to license ensifentrine to companies with expertise and experience in developing and commercializing products in those regions. To that end, we have entered into a strategic collaboration with Nuance Pharma Limited, a Shanghai-based specialty pharmaceutical company (“Nuance Pharma”), to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China.
In Phase 2 clinical trials, ensifentrine has demonstrated positive results in patients with COPD, asthma and cystic fibrosis (“CF”). We are developing ensifentrine in three formulations for the most widely used inhalation devices: nebulizer, dry powder inhaler (“DPI”) and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (“pMDI”). Ensifentrine has shown positive Phase 2 data in COPD trials when delivered by each of these formulations.
Our near term operating focus is the ongoing ENHANCE program, related chemistry, manufacturing and controls, regulatory efforts and early pre-commercial activities. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, together with funding expected to become available under the Term Loan and expected cash receipts from the U.K. tax credit, will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2023.
Overview of COPD and current treatments
COPD is a common, chronic, progressive, and life-threatening respiratory disease without a cure. It damages the airways and lungs, leading to debilitating breathlessness, hospitalizations, and death. COPD has a major impact on everyday life. Patients struggle with basic activities such as getting out of bed, showering, eating, and walking. Worldwide, COPD affects approximately 384 million people and is the third leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization.
The goal of COPD pharmacological therapy is to improve patients’ quality of life by reducing symptoms, decreasing the quantity and severity of exacerbations (often an escalation of symptoms) and to improve patients’ ability to function (GOLD 2021).
For approximately 40 years, the treatment of COPD has been dominated by three classes of inhaled therapies approved for use by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”): anti-muscarinics, beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (“ICSs”). COPD patients are frequently treated with bronchodilators, including long-acting anti-muscarinics (“LAMAs”) and long-acting beta-agonists (“LABAs”), to relieve airway constriction and make it easier to breathe. In addition, patients at risk for exacerbations may be prescribed ICSs to prevent them. 
Certain COPD patients are treated with the oral PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast (Daliresp®), which has demonstrated a reduction in exacerbation risk in patients with severe chronic bronchitis. However, oral PDE4 therapy results in systemic exposure which has been associated with unfavorable gastrointestinal side-effects such as nausea, emesis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss.
COPD treatments are often combined in patients who remain uncontrolled on one or two therapies. These include LAMA/LABA combinations or LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations. Unfortunately, clinical data suggests that 40-60% 
of patients on dual or triple therapy still experience significant symptoms of COPD, including breathlessness. These chronic recurring symptoms limit their daily activities and impair quality of life. Despite receiving maximum therapy, it is estimated that more than 1 million patients in the U.S. alone remain symptomatic. For these patients, no available inhaled therapies offer treatment options beyond standard LAMA / LABA and ICS combinations. New treatment options are urgently needed to help improve lung function, symptoms, and overall quality of life in these patients.
Ensifentrine
Ensifentrine is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitor. This dual inhibition enables it to act as a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory agent in a single compound. Importantly, this therapeutic profile differentiates it from existing classes of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory treatments. We are not aware of any other single compound in clinical development or approved by the FDA nor the European Commission for the treatment of respiratory diseases that acts both as a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory agent. If successfully developed and approved, ensifentrine has the potential to be the first novel class of therapeutic in COPD in over 10 years and the only bronchodilator option as an add-on to existing dual / triple therapy. 
Ensifentrine has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both lung function and COPD symptoms, including breathlessness, in our prior Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe COPD. In addition, ensifentrine showed further improved lung function and reduced lung volumes in patients taking standard short- and long-acting bronchodilator therapy, including maximum bronchodilator treatment with dual/triple therapy. 
Safety profile
Ensifentrine has demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo in clinical trials involving more than 1,400 people to date. Additionally, ensifentrine did not prolong the QT interval or impact other cardiac conduction parameters in a thorough QT study in healthy volunteers. It is delivered directly to the lungs by inhalation to maximize pulmonary exposure to ensifentrine while minimizing systemic exposure. This feature minimizes any systemic side-effects such as the gastrointestinal disturbance associated with oral PDE4 inhibitors. In addition, in non-clinical trials ensifentrine has demonstrated high selectivity for PDE3 and PDE4 over other enzymes and receptors, which is believed to minimize off-target effects.
Differentiated profile
By inhibiting PDE3 and PDE4, ensifentrine impacts three key mechanisms in respiratory disease: bronchodilation, inflammation and mucociliary clearance. Ensifentrine is designed to increase the levels of cellular cAMP and cGMP in smooth muscle cells and inflammatory cells, resulting in bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects. Ensifentrine is also designed to stimulate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”), which is an ion channel in the epithelial cells lining the airways. Mutations in the CFTR protein result in poorly or non-functioning ion channels, which cause CF and are potentially important in COPD. CFTR stimulation leads to improved electrolyte balance in the lung and thinning of the mucus, which facilitates mucociliary clearance and leads to improved lung function and potentially a reduction in lung infections. 
Dual inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 has shown enhanced or synergistic effects compared with inhibition of either PDE alone on contraction of airway smooth muscle and suppression of inflammatory mediator release in several preclinical studies. We believe these enhanced effects may increase the utility of ensifentrine in the treatment of respiratory diseases including COPD, asthma and CF. 
We believe ensifentrine has the potential to address the large unmet need in treating COPD with its improvement in lung function, COPD symptoms and meaningful improvement in quality of life.
Clinical data
Ensifentrine has demonstrated improvements in lung function, symptoms and quality of life with or without background therapy in two 4-week, Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trials in moderate to severe COPD patients. In both studies ensifentrine was well tolerated at all doses with an adverse event profile similar to placebo:
•In March 2018, we reported positive top-line results with ensifentrine as monotherapy from our first Phase 2b trial in 403 patients. The trial evaluated four doses of nebulized ensifentrine (0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg and 6 mg) or placebo twice daily over 4 weeks. Patients withheld use of regular long-acting bronchodilator therapy for the duration of the study. The trial met its primary endpoint of improved lung function with ensifentrine demonstrating a clinically and statistically significant increase in peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (“FEV1”) at week 4 compared to placebo. In addition, clinically relevant secondary endpoints were met including significant progressive improvements in COPD symptoms. 
•In January 2020, we reported positive top-line results with ensifentrine added on to background therapy from our second Phase 2b trial in 413 patients. This trial evaluated four doses of nebulized ensifentrine (0.375 mg, 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg and 3 mg) or placebo added on to treatment with once-daily tiotropium (Spiriva® Respimat®), a commonly used LAMA bronchodilator, in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe COPD who required additional treatment. The trial met its primary endpoint of improved lung function, with ensifentrine plus tiotropium demonstrating a clinically and statistically significant dose-dependent improvement in peak FEV1 and FEV1 over 12 hours with ensifentrine at week 4, compared to placebo plus tiotropium. Additionally, clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in health-related quality of life were observed with ensifentrine added on to tiotropium.

In May 2020, the FDA provided guidance on key features of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program in response to our End-of-Phase 2 briefing package for nebulized ensifentrine as a maintenance treatment for COPD. This included clarity on the dose, primary and secondary endpoints, patient population and program design.
In September 2020, we initiated our ENHANCE Phase 3 trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized ensifentrine in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (ENHANCE-1 and ENHANCE-2) are designed to evaluate ensifentrine as monotherapy and added onto a single bronchodilator. 
Each study is expected to enroll approximately 800 moderate to severe, symptomatic COPD patients at sites primarily in the U.S. and Europe. The two study designs will replicate measurements of efficacy and safety data over 24 weeks but ENHANCE-1 will also evaluate longer-term safety in 400 patients over 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is improvement in lung function measured by FEV1 over 12 hours with ensifentrine after 12 weeks of treatment. Key secondary endpoints include measurements of COPD symptoms and health-related quality of life through 24 weeks assessed via the validated patient reported outcome tools, E-RS and SGRQ. Additional lung function endpoints including peak and morning trough FEV1 will also be assessed. Exacerbations will be analyzed by individual study and in a pooled analysis.
Patient enrollment completed in the 48-week subset of the ENHANCE-1 trial in December 2021 and in the ENHANCE-2 trial in January 2022. Complete enrollment in the 24-week subset of ENHANCE-1 is expected around the end of the second quarter of 2022. We expect to report top-line data from ENHANCE-2 in the third quarter of 2022 and from ENHANCE-1 around the end of 2022. Conditional upon positive results, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA in the first half of 2023.
Formulations
Verona Pharma has developed formulations of ensifentrine for the three most widely used inhalation devices: nebulizer, DPI and pMDI. The nebulized formulation of ensifentrine is designed to be suitable for use in a standard jet nebulizer, not a proprietary device. Delivery of COPD medications by nebulizer is important because such medications can be used by adults of almost any age and dexterity and regardless of peak inspiratory flow, offering advantages to patients who may struggle to operate handheld inhaler devices or have low peak inspiratory flow. DPI and pMDI handheld inhaler formats are relatively portable and convenient and are also important delivery mechanisms.
While we continue to focus on development of the nebulized formulation of ensifentrine, we believe the development of pMDI and DPI formulations of ensifentrine provides additional lifecycle opportunities including new potential indications, formulation combinations and collaborations. In February 2021, we reported positive results from the second, multiple dose part of a Phase 2 trial with pMDI ensifentrine in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Ensifentrine delivered by pMDI met all of the primary and secondary lung function endpoints. The improvement in lung function was dose-ordered and statistically significant at peak and over the 12-hour dosing interval compared with placebo, and supports twice-daily dosing of ensifentrine via pMDI for the treatment of COPD. Data from the single dose part of the study were reported in March 2020.
Verona Pharma has successfully demonstrated proof of concept in Phase 2 COPD trials with all three formulations. In addition, the data from Phase 2 trials were consistent across the three formulations. All three dosing forms have demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and duration of action, supporting twice-daily dosing and a safety profile similar to placebo. 
Pipeline
The following table summarizes our development programs.
Potential additional indications for ensifentrine
Cystic fibrosis and asthma
In addition to COPD, we believe ensifentrine has potential applications in other respiratory diseases including CF and asthma.
CF is a progressive, fatal genetic disease without a cure and a median age of death of 46 years. The condition is characterized by thick, sticky mucus that damages many of the body’s organs. It causes repeat and persistent lung infections that result in frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. Other symptoms include malnutrition, constipation and diarrhea, and some adults develop diabetes, arthritis and liver problems.
CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in the U.S. and Europe. More than 70,000 people worldwide are living with CF and approximately 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The U.S. and European regulatory authorities consider CF to be a rare, or orphan, disease and provide incentives to encourage development of effective new treatments.
CF patients endure multiple daily medications, taking an average of seven per day, including inhaled and injected treatments to clear mucus and fight infections as well as enzyme pills to digest food. Ultimately, selected patients have lung transplants.
In a Phase 2a clinical trial, a single dose of nebulized ensifentrine demonstrated an improvement in lung function in patients with CF. In addition, in preclinical studies, ensifentrine activated the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”), which is beneficial in reducing mucous viscosity and improving mucociliary clearance. We believe these data support the continued development of ensifentrine as a potential therapy for CF.
Asthma is a common lung condition that causes sporadic breathing difficulties. The disease causes narrowing and swelling of the airways leading to symptoms including difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing and tightness in the chest. Exposure to triggers such as allergens or irritants can lead to asthma attacks.
Asthma attacks vary in severity and frequency. More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma and it is the most common chronic disease among children, according to the World Health Organization.
Although there is no cure, symptoms may be prevented by avoiding triggers and through established maintenance therapies including bronchodilators, ICS, anti-IgE agents and leukotriene inhibitors.
Ensifentrine has shown potential in a Phase 2a clinical trial in asthma. The data from this trial, published in October 2019 in the journal Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics, demonstrated that ensifentrine produced dose-dependent improvements in bronchodilation that were comparable to current rescue medication, high dose nebulized albuterol. Importantly, ensifentrine was well tolerated and patients experienced fewer systemic effects than those receiving albuterol.
COVID-19
While our initial focus remained on the treatment of COPD, we evaluated ensifentrine as a potential treatment option for COVID-19. In April 2021, we reported results from a pilot study with pMDI ensifentrine showing ensifentrine added on to standard of care was well tolerated in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The 45 patient study was not powered to identify statistically significant efficacy outcomes and no clinical efficacy benefit with ensifentrine added on to standard of care was observed. We do not plan to conduct further studies of ensifentrine in the treatment of COVID-19.
Our team
Our expert team has decades of experience in developing and commercializing respiratory therapeutics including the following COPD therapeutics: Advair®; Anoro Ellipta®; Breo®; Flovent®; Flutiform®; Incruse Ellipta®; Serevent®; Symbicort®; Tudorza Pressair® and Ventolin®.
MANUFACTURING 
We do not have manufacturing facilities and rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the supply of current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) compliant clinical trial materials of ensifentrine, and any future product candidates, as well as for commercial quantities of ensifentrine and any future product candidates, if approved. We currently do not have any agreements for the long-term commercial production of ensifentrine. 
While we may contract with other CMOs in the future, we currently have one CMO for the manufacture of ensifentrine drug substance and one CMO for each formulation of ensifentrine.
All of our current CMOs have commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the ensifentrine drug substance and drug product manufacturing processes can be transferred to other CMOs to produce clinical and commercial supplies in the ordinary course of business.
COMMERCIALIZATION
United States
In the United States, we are preparing to commercialize nebulized ensifentrine ourselves, if approved. Current maintenance COPD treatments in the U.S. generate approximately $10.5 billion in sales. Despite the availability of these therapies, it is estimated that more than 1 million patients remain symptomatic following treatment with maximum therapy. These patients need therapies that can help improve their lung function and symptoms. In addition to the number of patients that remain symptomatic, COPD places a tremendous burden on the U.S. healthcare system with approximately $50 billion in direct and indirect costs.
Based on our market research, conducted with U.S. healthcare providers and payers, we believe ensifentrine would be widely adopted and that the majority of ensifentrine’s use would be primarily as an add-on to dual or triple therapy regimens. This is due to the urgent unmet need for new therapies to help improve lung function, symptoms and quality of life. Our market research also suggests the majority of ensifentrine usage would be initially commenced by pulmonologists. Due to this focused prescriber base, we anticipate a field sales force of approximately 100 representatives would be able to reach the potential ensifentrine opportunity. 
International
COPD affects over 384 million people worldwide with many patients remaining undiagnosed. Our strategy outside of the U.S. including Asia, Europe and Latin America, is to establish partnerships with leading companies that can support the further development and commercialization of ensifentrine in those regions.
In June 2021, we executed on this strategy by entering into a strategic collaboration with Nuance Pharma, a Shanghai-based specialty pharmaceutical company, with a potential value of up to $219.0 million to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Nuance Pharma the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ensifentrine in Greater China. In return, we received an aggregate $40.0 million upfront payment consisting of $25.0 million in cash and an equity interest valued at $15.0 million, as of June 9, 2021, in Nuance Biotech, the parent company of Nuance Pharma. We are eligible to receive further milestone payments of up to $179.0 million that are triggered upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales in Greater China.
Nuance Pharma is responsible for all costs related to clinical development and commercialization in Greater China. A joint steering committee has been established to ensure ensifentrine’s clinical development in the region aligns with our global development and commercialization strategy. Nuance Pharma plans to file an Investigational New Drug Application with the China Food and Drug Administration and afterwards to begin clinical studies for the treatment of COPD in Greater China. 
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. If successfully developed and commercialized, ensifentrine will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
Ensifentrine is a unique, first-in-class therapeutic candidate with both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties in a single compound. As far as we are aware, no other dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitor is on the market nor in clinical development. Based on our market research, we expect ensifentrine to be used mainly in addition to existing dual and triple therapies, LAMA / LABA / ICS, where no additional treatment options exist for patients who are symptomatic. Some healthcare providers have indicated that they would use it as earlier line therapy based on ensifentrine’s clinical profile. 
Consequently, we believe that, if approved, nebulized ensifentrine’s unique profile will enable it to compete with all approved COPD therapies including nebulized and handheld inhaler formulations, DPI and pMDI. Furthermore, because ensifentrine’s mechanism of action is complementary to available therapies, we believe it could be used in addition to these treatments.
Within the currently approved nebulizer products for the maintenance treatment of COPD, we consider ensifentrine's potential competitors in the U.S. market to be LABAs (Brovana® and Perforomist®) and LAMAs (Yupelri® and Lonhala®Magnair®). 
In the DPI/pMDI maintenance treatment of COPD market, ensifentrine’s current closest potential competitors are Symbicort®, a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator and ICS marketed by AstraZeneca plc, Spiriva®, a long-acting anti-muscarinic bronchodilator marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Advair®, a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator and ICS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc, Utibron Neohaler®, a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and long-acting anti-muscarinic bronchodilator marketed by Novartis International AG, Breo®, a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator and ICS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, and Anoro®, a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator and long-acting anti-muscarinic bronchodilator marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. A triple-combination therapy of a LAMA, a LABA and ICS, developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Trelegy Ellipta®, has been approved in the U.S. and the European Union and AstraZeneca also has a triple-therapy combination product (LAMA / LABA / ICS), Breztri Aerosphere® that was approved in the U.S. in July 2020, in the European Union in December 2020 and in China in December 2019. 
Other potential therapies in clinical development for the prevention of COPD exacerbations include injectable biologics. Sanofi’s anti-IL4, Dupixent®, AstraZeneca’s anti-IL5, Fasenra®, GlaxoSmithKline’s anti-IL5, Nucala®, and Chiesi’s PDE4 inhibitor, Tanimilast, are in Phase 3 trials. We are also aware of several anti-inflammatories and bronchodilators that are in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of COPD.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally 
or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. 
As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consisted of nine issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, sixty issued foreign patents and forty-eight pending foreign applications including two patent applications made under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. These patents and patent applications include claims directed to certain respirable formulations comprising ensifentrine, a crystalline form of ensifentrine, combinations of ensifentrine with certain respiratory drugs, certain salts of ensifentrine, ensifentrine for use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, and a method of making ensifentrine, with expected expiry dates up to 2041. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non‑provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory‑related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know‑how and inventions. 
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third‑party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”
License agreement with Ligand (formerly Vernalis)
In February 2005, Rhinopharma Limited (“Rhinopharma”) entered into an assignment and license agreement with Ligand UK Development Limited (formerly Vernalis Development Limited) (“Ligand”), which since October 2018 has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We refer to the assignment and license agreement as the Ligand Agreement. In 2006, we acquired Rhinopharma and all its rights and liabilities under the Ligand Agreement. Pursuant to the Ligand Agreement, Ligand has assigned to us all its rights to certain patents and patent applications relating to ensifentrine and related compounds, or the Ligand Patents. We cannot further assign the Ligand Patents to a third party without Ligand's prior consent. Ligand also granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain Ligand know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize products, or the Licensed Products, based on PDE inhibitors developed using Ligand Patents, Ligand know-how and the physical stock of certain compounds, including ensifentrine, which we refer to as the Program IP, in the treatment of human or animal allergic or inflammatory disorders. Pursuant to the Ligand Agreement, we must maintain the Ligand Patents and use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products. 
Under the Ligand Agreement, we are obligated to pay Ligand a milestone payment of £5.0 million upon the first approval of any regulatory authority for the commercialization of any Licensed Product, and a portion equal to a percentage in the mid-twenties of any consideration received from any of our sublicensees for Ligand Patents or Ligand know-how, excluding royalties. We must also pay Ligand, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, a low single digit percentage royalty based on net sales of each Licensed Product for a period beginning with the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in a country and ending on the later of the expiration of a certain number of years after such first commercial sale and if applicable the expiration of the last to expire valid claim in the Ligand Patents covering the development, manufacture or commercialization of such Licensed Product in such country. Prior to the first commercial sale of each Licensed Product, such royalties also are due in the same percentages for any named patient sales. 
The Ligand Agreement continues until terminated by either party in accordance with its terms. Either party may terminate the Ligand Agreement for an uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the Ligand Agreement upon 90 days' prior written notice. Ligand may terminate the Ligand Agreement if we notify Ligand of our intention to abandon any Ligand Patents or allow any Ligand Patents to lapse. Upon termination of the Ligand Agreement, we must cease use of any Program IP and assign the Ligand Patents and any improvements thereto back to Ligand.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
FDA drug approval process 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to file an application for assessment or non approval of a pending new drug applications (“NDA”), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•Completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations; 
•Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•Submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
•Completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if required by the FDA;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA and U.S. Prescribing Information to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S..
Non-clinical Studies 
Non-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to ship in interstate commerce and administer an investigational new drug product to humans. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects or a legal representative provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which reviews the data and recommends whether or not a study may move forward at designated checkpoints. It may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
•Phase 1: The drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
•Phase 2: The drug candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
•Phase 3: The drug candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing 
process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Marketing Approval 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing”of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, 
changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. 
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new molecular entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United 
States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Post-Approval Requirements 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products under which NDA applicants must pay a substantial “program fee” for each prescription drug product approved in an NDA. 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
•Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
•Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity 
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (a “505(b)(2) NDA”), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Foreign regulation
In order to market any medicinal product outside of the U.S., similar regulatory requirements, including adherence to GLP, Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) and Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”), to initiate clinical trials and, subsequently, to obtain marketing approval of a new pharmaceutical product are in place in each jurisdiction and vary country to country.
Each jurisdiction will apply these regulations in their assessment of clinical trial applications and marketing authorization applications. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another. In addition, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union (“EU”) are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (“ICH”) guidelines on GCP as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The 
sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (“CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. 
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
Marketing authorization
In the EEA, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:
•“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of medicinal products, such as (i) medicines derived from biotechnology processes, (ii) advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), (iii) orphan designated medicinal products, and (iv) products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
•“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
Under the above described procedures, in order to grant the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. 
Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated assessment of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the PRIME scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Data and marketing exclusivity
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon MA. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new active substance, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Pediatric development
In the EEA, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), agreed with the EMA's Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. We have received a waiver for pediatric data in COPD.
Orphan Medicinal Products
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication which means that the EU regulatory authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant an MA, or accept an application to extend a MA for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for MA. 
Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity, or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (1) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Post-Approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).
All new MAA must include a risk management plan (“RMP”) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU and EU member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. 
EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. However, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain (“GB”); broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a guidance on how various aspects of the UK regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, importing, exporting, and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development, or commercialization of medicines in the UK. The new guidance was given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Exit Regulations”). 
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, without first establishing an EAA entity, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs . In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain an MA to commercialize products in the UK. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a GB authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB.
There is no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period of market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. Similar laws exist in foreign jurisdictions.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted 
the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 
In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies' marketing of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statue constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers' and manufacturers' compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties and additional penalties for "knowing failures." Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. 
In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member states are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. member states may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. 
Healthcare Reform 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care 
plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers' outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions was enacted, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional price increases. In particular, we anticipate that Medicare Part B will play an important role in the reimbursement of ensifentrine. Changes in how products are reimbursed through Medicare Part B may affect the overall coverage for ensifentrine, if approved. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages 
and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in certain other countries that impose similar obligations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
