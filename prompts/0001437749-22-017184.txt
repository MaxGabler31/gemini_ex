Architectural and Engineering Services. Companies in Professional Services provide licensed architectural, including commercial and industrial building design, and engineering services.
 
Proprietary Rights
 
We do not currently hold any patents, franchises or concessions. In our overhaul and repair business, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of equipment that we maintain for our customers often include language in repair manuals that relate to their equipment, asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. There can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including the possible use of legal proceedings. In the event of such legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that such actions against the Company will be unsuccessful. However, we believe that our use of OEM manufacture and repair manuals is lawful.

Seasonality
 
Our Aerospace Products businesses are generally not seasonal. We believe that our Professional Services businesses, however, are subject to seasonality based on local weather conditions, agricultural and petroleum prices, employment levels and the travel habits of visitors in the market service area.
Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
 
We purchase raw materials, primarily consisting of sheet and plate aluminum, from various vendors. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. We believe that the availability of raw materials to us is adequate to support our Aerospace Products operations.
Backlog
 
Our backlog as of April 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:
 

Industry Segment | | | | | 
----------------------+------+--------+------+---+-------
(in thousands) | 2022 | | 2021 | 
Aerospace Products | $ | 21,758 | | $ | 19,409
Professional Services | | 309 | | | 427 
Total backlog | $ | 22,067 | | $ | 19,836

 
Our backlog as of July 1, 2022 totaled $24,165; consisting of $23,883 and $282, respectively, for Aerospace Products and Professional Services. The backlog includes firm pending and contract orders, which may not be completed within the next fiscal year. A portion of this backlog may be delivered after fiscal year 2023. This is standard for the industry in which modifications services and related contracts may take several months or years to complete. Such actions force backlog as additional customers request modifications, but must wait for other projects to be completed. There can be no assurance that all orders will be completed or that some may ever commence.
 
Dependence on Significant Customers
 
During the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022 we derived 34.1% of our revenue from five customers, and we had two "major customers" (10 percent or more of consolidated revenue) that provided 25.0% of total revenue. At April 30, 2022, we had one customer that accounted for 44.8% of our total accounts receivable.
 
Competition
 
We compete in the aerospace and casino gaming industries. In the aerospace industry, we compete against peer companies of which some are divisions or subsidiaries of other large companies, in the manufacture of aircraft structures, systems components, subassemblies, detail parts and aircraft modifications. Competition for the repair and overhaul of aviation components comes from three primary sources, some of whom possess greater financial and other resources than we have: OEMs, governmental support depots, and other independent repair and overhaul companies. OEMs also maintain service centers which provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture. Many governments maintain aircraft support depots in their military organizations that maintain and repair the aircraft they operate. Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business. Participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily based on size of business and technical capabilities, quality, turnaround time, capacity and price.
 
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies and financial condition. We compete with other casino facilities in the Kansas region. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals and card parlors.

Government Regulation and Industry Oversight
 
The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA to design, engineer, test and certify replacement and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.
 
We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and repair services that comply with the applicable government regulations. The FAA regulates flight operations and requires that aircraft components meet FAA stringent standards. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We currently satisfy these maintenance standards allowing component repair and overhaul services at our FAA-approved repair stations.
 
Generally, the FAA only grants licenses for the manufacture or repair of a specific aircraft component, rather than the broader licenses that have been granted in the past. The FAA licensing process may be costly and time-consuming. To obtain an FAA license, an applicant must satisfy all applicable regulations of the FAA governing repair stations. These regulations require that an applicant have experienced personnel, inspection systems, suitable facilities and equipment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate a need for the license. Because an applicant must procure manufacturing and repair manuals relating to each particular aircraft component in order to obtain a license with respect to that component, the application process may involve substantial time and cost.
 
Our Professional Services businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning employment, alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
 
Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, or OSHA, mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in the United States. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.
 
Moreover, our gaming operations are regulated largely by the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission and the Kansas Lottery. The gaming industry, in general, is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each gaming facility is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Other than persons employed by our gaming management subsidiaries there were 107 full time and 5 part time employees on April 30, 2022 compared to 113 full time and 5 part time employees on April 30, 2021. As of July 8, 2022, staffing was 111 full time and 6 part time employees. Our staffing at Boot Hill Casino on April 30, 2022 was 180 full time and 60 part time employees and 172 full time employees and 60 part time employees on April 30, 2021. As of July 8, 2022 our staffing at Boot Hill Casino was 191 full time employees and 56 part time employees.
 
We believe our success as a company depends on the strength of our workforce.  Our Vice-President, reporting to our President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy.  This includes recruiting, hiring, training and retention as well as the development of our compensation and benefits programs.
 
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, we offer benefits that support their physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to affordable and convenient medical programs intended to meet their physical and emotional needs and the needs of their families.  To foster retention, employees with fifteen or more years of service receive an annual retention bonus.
 
As an added benefit for employees, we offer a 401(k) savings plan with a Company match as well as paid vacation and personal days. These benefits are in addition to the Company’s market-based compensation program designed to maintain competitive compensation packages for all employees.
 
None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
