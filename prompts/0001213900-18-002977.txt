Item 1. Business.
 
Healthier Choices Management Corp. (the “Company”) is a holding company focused on providing consumers with healthier daily choices with respect to nutrition and other lifestyle alternatives. The Company currently operates thirteen retail vape stores in the Southeast region of the United States, through which it offers e-liquids, vaporizers and related products. The Company also operates Ada’s Natural Market, a natural and organic grocery store, through its wholly owned subsidiary Healthy Choice Markets, Inc. Ada’s Natural Market offers fresh produce, bulk foods, vitamins and supplements, packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, health & beauty products and natural household items.
 
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma struck Florida and caused major power outages to several of the Company’s operating facilities. Due to the loss of electricity, which lasted approximately one week, the Company suffered lost sales and inventory spoilage. The Company submitted insurance claims to recover a portion of the cost of lost sales and inventory spoilage of approximately $41,000. As of December 31, 2017, the insurance claims have been accepted by our insurance carrier and are included in other assets as payment has not been received.
 
VAPORIZER AND E-LIQUID BUSINESS
 
Retail Stores
 
While evaluating retail store operations in 2016, management decided to close three of its Atlanta area vape stores on February 15, 2016, and December 31, 2016. Additionally, six of its Florida vape stores were closed between May 31, 2016 and December 31, 2016.
Vaporizers
 
“Vaporizers” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Regardless of their construction, they are comprised of three functional components:

● | a mouthpiece, which is a small plastic cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the electronic devices which include: a lithium-ion battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED, which illuminates to indicate use. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
When a user draws air through the vaporizer, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution stored in the mouthpiece/cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either of which may be flavored.
 
Vaporizers feature a tank or chamber, a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with e-liquid or the chamber with dry herb or leaf. The vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled.
 
Our Brands
 
We sell a wide variety of our e-liquid under the Vape Store brand. Our in-house engineering and graphic design teams work to provide aesthetically pleasing, technologically advanced and affordable vaporizer and e-liquid flavor options. We are in the process of preparing to commercialize additional brands which we intend to market to new customers and demographics.
Our Improvements and Product Development on Intellectual Property
 
We have developed, trademarked and are preparing to commercialize additional products. We include product development expenses as part of our operating expenses. While we currently own no patents which are material to our business, we were recently issued a utility patent covering a vaporizer or electronic cigarette device. This patented improvement is intended to prevent the release and ingestion of metal particles from the heating element from entering the lungs of the user of the vaporizer or electronic cigarette. Additionally, we have a suite of patent applications pending in the United States. There is no assurance that we will be awarded patents for of any of these pending patent applications.

Vaporizer Biometric Fingerprint Lock Sensor Patent
 
We have a patent pending for a biometric fingerprint lock sensor that can be used in vaporizers. The biometric fingerprint lock sensor will allow the owner of the vaporizer to keep the device locked and turned off unless the authorized user unlocks the device via fingerprint scan, protecting the device from use by another individual. This technology may be used to protect against minors being able to turn on the device and will also deem the devices unusable in the event the device is lost or stolen. There is no assurance that we will be awarded a patent for this technology.
Flavor Profiles
 
We are developing new flavor profiles that are distinct to our brands. We believe that as the vaporizer industry matures, users of vaporizers and e-liquids will continue to develop preferences for the product based not only on their quality, ability to successfully deliver nicotine, battery capacity, and vapor volume they generate, but on taste and flavor, like smokers do with their preferred brand of conventional tobacco cigarettes.
Our Kits and Accessories
 
Our vaporizers are available in kits that contain everything a user needs to begin enjoying their “vaping” experience. In addition to kits, we sell replacement parts including batteries, coils, refill cartridges or cartomizers that contain the liquid solution, atomizers, tanks and e-liquids. Our refill cartridges and e-liquids are available in various assorted flavors and nicotine levels (including 0.0% nicotine). In addition to our vaporizer products, we sell an assortment of accessories, including various types of chargers (including USB chargers), carrying cases and lanyards.
The Market for Vaporizers
 
We market our vaporizers as an alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes and cigars. We offer our products in multiple nicotine strengths and flavors. Because vaporizers and electronic cigarettes offer a “smoking” experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their nicotine cravings without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases vaporizers may be used where tobacco-burning cigarettes may not. Vaporizers may be used in some instances where for regulatory or safety reasons tobacco burning cigarettes may not be used. However, certain states, cities, businesses, providers of transportation and public venues in the U.S. have banned the use of vaporizers, where traditional cigarettes may not be smoked, while others are considering banning the use of vaporizers. We cannot provide any assurances that the use of vaporizers will be permitted in places where traditional tobacco burning cigarette use is banned. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Advertising
 
Currently, we advertise our products primarily through point of sale materials and displays at retail locations. We also attempt to build brand awareness through social media marketing activities, price promotions, in-store and on-premise promotions, public relations and radio advertising. We intend to continue to strategically manage our advertising activities in 2018 to gain editorial coverage for our brands. Some of our competitors promote their brands through print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. We believe that our and our competitors’ efforts have helped increase our sales, our product acceptance and general industry awareness.
Distribution and Sales
 
The Company sells directly to consumers through thirteen company owned retail vape stores. Our management believes that consumers are shifting towards vape stores for an enhanced experience. This enhanced experienced is derived from the greater variety of products at the stores, the knowledgeable staff and the social atmosphere. The Company anticipates a significant portion of future revenue will continue to come from its retail stores.
Business Strategy
 
We believe and are seeing in our current stores that there is a large consumer demand centered on the vaporizer products and the “atmosphere” created by the vape stores. We believe that our reputation and our experience in the vaporizer industry, from a development, customer service and production perspective, give us an advantage in attracting customers.

Moreover, we believe that our history with our suppliers, including the volume of products we source, gives us an advantage over other market participants as it relates to favorable pricing, priority as to inventory supply and delivery and first access to new products, including first access to next generation products and technology.
 
Our goal is to achieve a position of sustainable leadership in the vaporizer industry. Our strategy consists of the following key elements:
 

● | develop new product offerings with new technology and performance advancements; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue our product focus on vaporizers and e-liquids; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | invest in and leverage our existing brand through marketing and advertising; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding into new potential markets; 
--+------------------------------------------


● | align our product offerings and cost with market demand; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | consider diversifying our line of business 
--+-----------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Competition in the vaporizer and e-liquid industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of vaporizes, most notably Altria Group, Inc., JT International, Imperial Tobacco, and Reynolds American, Inc., which are big tobacco companies that have vaporizer and electronic cigarette business segments. The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours. As a general matter, we have access to market and sell the similar vaporizers as our competitors and we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors; accordingly, the key competitive factors for our success is the quality of service we offer our customers, the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including media advertising campaigns and, increasingly, the ability to identify and develop new sources of customers.
 
As discussed above, we compete against “big tobacco”, U.S. cigarette manufacturers of both conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes like Altria Group, Inc., JT International, Imperial Tobacco, and Reynolds American, Inc. We compete against “big tobacco” who offers not only conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes and vaporizers, but also smokeless tobacco products such as “snus” (a form of moist ground smokeless tobacco that is usually sold in sachet form that resembles small tea bags), chewing tobacco and snuff. “Big tobacco” has nearly limitless resources, global distribution networks in place and a customer base that is fiercely loyal to their brands. Furthermore, we believe that “big tobacco” is devoting more attention and resources to developing, acquiring technology patents, and offering electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and e-liquids as these markets grow. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, “big tobacco” is better positioned than small competitors like us to capture a larger share of the electronic cigarette market. We also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any of our competitors, some of whom have far greater resources, capital, experience, market penetration, sales and distribution channels than us. If our major competitors were, for example, to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, we could respond by offering price discounts, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have no manufacturing capabilities and do not intend to develop any manufacturing capabilities. Third party manufacturers make our products to meet our design specifications. We depend on third party manufacturers for our vaporizer e-liquid and accessories. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and or consistency of our products may harm our relationships and reputation with customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In order to minimize the risk of supply interruption, we currently utilize several third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products to our specifications.
 
We currently utilize several manufacturers both domestically and internationally. We contract with our manufacturers on a purchase order basis. We do not have any output or requirements contracts with any of our manufacturers. Our manufacturers provide us with finished products, which we hold in inventory for distribution, sale and use. Certain Chinese factories and the products they export have recently been the source of safety concerns and recalls, which is generally attributed to lax regulatory, quality control and safety standards. Should Chinese factories continue to draw public criticism for exporting unsafe products, whether those products relate to our products or not, we may be adversely affected by the stigma associated with Chinese production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
 
Although we believe that several alternative sources for our products are available, any failure to obtain the components, chemical constituents and manufacturing services necessary for the production of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We believe that an adequate supply of product and raw materials will be available to us as needed and from multiple sources and suppliers.
 
Patent Litigation
 
Third party patent lawsuits alleging our infringement of patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights have and could force us to do one or more of the following:

● | stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | incur significant legal expenses; 
--+--------------------------------------


● | pay substantial damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Future third party lawsuits alleging our infringement of patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
We are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others and may be required to obtain more in the future and as the product continues to evolve. We cannot assure you that any future licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while we attempt to design around such patents, or could find that the development, manufacture, or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed. Litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement asserted against us by others, or assert claims of infringement to enforce patents issued to us or exclusively licensed to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how possessed by us, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. In addition, we may become involved in oppositions in foreign jurisdictions, reexaminations declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors. Litigation, opposition, reexamination or interference proceedings could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and may have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, we cannot assure you that our efforts to maintain or defend our patents will be successful.
 
Regulations
 
Since a 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals decision, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “tobacco products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and the Tobacco Control Act. Under this decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. This is contrary to anti-smoking devices like nicotine patches, which undergo more extensive FDA regulation. Because the Company does not market its electronic cigarettes for therapeutic purposes, the Company’s electronic cigarettes are subject to being classified as “tobacco products” under the Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.
 
On April 24, 2014, the FDA released proposed rules that would extend its regulatory authority to electronic cigarettes and certain other tobacco products under the Tobacco Control Act. The proposed rules would require that electronic cigarette manufacturers (i) register with the FDA and report electronic cigarette product and ingredient listings; (ii) market new electronic cigarette products only after FDA review; (iii) only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the electronic cigarette product will benefit public health as a whole; (iv) not distribute free samples; (v) implement minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18; (vi) include a health warning; and (vii) not sell electronic cigarettes in vending machines, unless in a facility that never admits youth. It is not known how long finalizing and implementing this regulatory process to may take. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the content of any final rules from the proposed rules or the impact they may have.

In this regard, total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell the Company’s products. At present, it is difficult to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact the Company to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting the Company’s competitive position.
 
State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. State and local regulation of the e-cigarette market and the usage of e-cigarettes is beginning to accelerate.
 
As local regulations expand, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes, which may have the effect of reducing the demand for the Company’s products and as a result have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to electronic cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to vaporizers and electronic cigarettes would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
On July 1, 2015, the FDA published a document entitled “Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking” or the Advance. Through the Advance, the FDA solicited public comments on whether it should issue rules with respect to nicotine exposure warning and child-resistant packaging for e-liquids containing nicotine. Following public comment, the FDA may issue proposed rules in furtherance of the purposes outlined in the Advance and ultimately pass the rules as proposed or in modified form. We cannot predict whether rules will be passed or if they will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial conditions.
 
The Company expects that the tobacco industry will experience significant regulatory developments over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s FCTC. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
 

● | the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labelling requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents’ levels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
If Vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, or e-liquids, are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market
 
We operate within the natural products retail industry, which is a subset of the United States grocery industry and the dietary supplement business. This industry includes conventional supermarkets, natural, gourmet and specialty food markets, mass and discount retailers, warehouse clubs, independent health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers’ markets, food co-ops, mail order and online retailers and multi-level marketers. Industry-wide sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements have experienced meaningful growth over the past several years, and we believe that growth will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements continues to be driven by numerous factors, including:
 

● | greater consumer focus on high-quality nutritional products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increased awareness of the importance of good nutrition to long-term wellness; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an aging Ft. Myer’s community that is seeking healthy lifestyle alternatives; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | heightened consumer awareness about the importance of food quality and a desire to avoid pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and genetically engineered ingredients in foods; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing consumer concerns over the use of harmful chemical additives in body care and household cleaning supplies; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | well-established natural and organic brands, which generate additional industry awareness and credibility with consumers; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the growth in the number of consumers with special dietary requirements as a result of allergies, chemical sensitivities, auto-immune disorders and other conditions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We are well-positioned to capitalize on favorable natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industry dynamics as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 
Strict focus on high-quality natural and organic grocery products. We offer high-quality products and brands, including an extensive selection of widely-recognized natural and organic food, dietary supplements, body care products, pet care products and books. We offer our customers approximately 10,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) of natural and organic products. We believe our broad product offering enables our customers to shop our stores for substantially all of their grocery and dietary supplement purchases. In our grocery departments, we primarily sell USDA certified organic produce and do not approve for sale grocery products that are known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. In addition, we only sell pasture-raised, humanely-raised dairy products. Consistent with this strategy, our product selection does not include items that do not meet our strict quality guidelines. Our store managers enhance our robust product offering by customizing their stores’ selections to address the preferences of local customers.

Engaging customer service experience based on education and empowerment. We strive to offer consistently exceptional customer service in a shopper-friendly environment, which we believe creates a differentiated shopping experience, enhances customer loyalty and generates repeat visits from our clientele. A key aspect of our customer service model is to provide free nutrition education to our customers. We believe this focus provides an engaging retail experience while also empowering our customers to make informed decisions about their health. We offer our science-based nutrition education through our trained employees, our newsletter and sales flyer, community out-reach programs, one-on-one nutrition health coaching, nutrition classes and cooking demonstrations.
 
Our Growth Strategies
 
We expect to pursue several strategies to continue our profitable growth, including:
 
Expand our store base. We intend to expand our store base through the acquisition of new stores.
 
Increase sales from existing customers. In order to increase our average ticket and the number of customer transactions, we plan to continue offering an engaging customer experience by providing science-based nutrition education and a differentiated merchandising strategy that delivers affordable, high-quality natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. We also plan to continue to utilize targeted marketing efforts to reach our existing customers, which we anticipate will drive customer transactions and convert occasional, single-category customers into core, multi-category customers.
 
Grow our customer base. We plan to implement several measures aimed at building our brand awareness and growing our customer base, including: (i) redesigning our website (www.adasmarket.com) to enhance functionality, create a more engaging user experience and increase its reach and effectiveness; (ii) introducing customer appreciation programs at all our stores; and (iii) developing new collateral marketing materials. We believe offering nutrition education has historically been one of our most effective marketing strategies for reaching new customers and increasing the demand for natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in our markets.
 
Improve operating margins. We expect to continue to improve our operating margins as we benefit from investments we have made or are making in fixed overhead and information technology. As we add additional stores, we expect to achieve greater economies of scale through sourcing and distribution. To achieve additional operating margin expansion, we intend to further optimize performance, maintain appropriate store labor levels and effectively manage product selection and pricing.
 
Ada’s Natural Market
 
Ada’s offers a comprehensive selection of natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in a smaller-store format that aims to provide a convenient, easily shopped and relaxed environment for our customers. Our store design emphasizes a clutter-free, organized feel, a quiet ambience accented with warm lighting.

Our product review team analyzes all new products and approves them for sale based on ingredients, price and uniqueness within the current product set. We actively research new products in the marketplace through our product vendors, private label manufacturers, scientific findings, customer requests and general trends in popular media. Our stores are able to fully merchandise all departments by providing an extensive assortment of natural and organic products. We do not believe we need to sell conventional products to fill our selection, increase our margins or attract more customers.
 
What We Sell. We operate both a full-service natural and organic grocery store and a dietary supplement store within a single retail location. The following is a breakdown of our product mix:
 
The products in our stores include:
 

● | Grocery. We offer a broad selection of natural and organic grocery products with an emphasis on minimally processed and single ingredient products that are not known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. Additionally, we carry a wide variety of products associated with special diets such as gluten free, vegetarian and non-dairy. Our grocery products include: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Produce. We sell USDA-certified organic produce and source from local, organic producers whenever feasible. Our selection varies based on seasonal availability, and we offer a variety of organic produce offerings that are not typically found at conventional food retailers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bulk Food and Private Label Products. We sell a wide selection of private label repackaged bulk and other products, including nuts, water, pasta, canned seafood, dried fruits, grains, granolas, honey, eggs, herbs, spices and teas.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Meats and Seafood. We offer naturally-raised or organic meat products. The meat products we offer come from animals that have never been treated with antibiotics or hormones or fed animal by-products. Additionally, we only buy from companies we believe employ humane animal-raising practices. Our seafood items are generally frozen at the time of processing and sold from our freezer section, thereby ensuring freshness and reducing food spoilage and safety issues. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dairy Products and Dairy Substitutes. We offer a broad selection of natural and organic dairy products such as milk, eggs, cheeses, yogurts and beverages, as well as non-dairy substitutes made from almonds, coconuts, rice and soy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prepared Foods. Our stores have a convenient selection of refrigerated prepared fresh food items, including salads, sandwiches, salsa, humus and wraps. The size of this offering varies by location. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bread and Baked Goods. We receive regular deliveries of a wide selection of bakery products for our bakery section, which includes an extensive selection of gluten-free items. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Beverages. We offer a wide variety of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages containing natural and organic ingredients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dietary Supplements. We offer a wide selection of vitamins, supplements and natural remedies. Our staff is well educated and trained on multiple aspects of natural medicine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Body Care. We offer a full range of cosmetics, skin care, hair care, fragrance and personal care products containing natural and organic ingredients. Our body care offerings range from bargain-priced basics to high-end formulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Household and General Merchandise. Our offerings include sustainable, hypo-allergenic and fragrance-free household products, including cleaning supplies, paper products, dish and laundry soap and other common household products, including diapers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Quality Assurance. We endeavor to ensure the quality of the products we sell. We work with reputable suppliers we believe are compliant with established regulatory and industry guidelines. Our purchasing department requires a complete supplier and product profile as part of the approval process. Our dietary supplement suppliers must follow Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current good manufacturing practices supported by quality assurance testing for both the base ingredients and the finished product. We expect our suppliers to comply with industry best practices for food safety.

Many of our suppliers are inspected and certified under the USDA National Organic Program, voluntary industry associations, and other third-party auditing programs with regard to additional ingredients, manufacturing and handling standards. We operate all our stores in compliance with the National Organic Program standards, which restricts the use of certain substances for cleaning and pest control and requires rigorous recordkeeping, among other requirements.
 
Our Pricing Strategy
 
We believe our pricing strategy allows our customers to shop our stores on a regular basis for their groceries and dietary supplements.
 
The key elements of our pricing strategy include:

As we expand our store base, we believe there are opportunities for increased leverage in fixed costs, such as administrative expenses, as well as increased economies of scale in sourcing products. We strive to keep our product, operating and general and administrative costs low, which allows us to continue to offer attractive pricing for our customers.
 
Our Store Operations
 
Store Hours. Our stores are open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sunday.
 
Store Management and Staffing. Our store staffing includes a manager and assistant manager, with department managers in each of the dietary supplement, grocery, dairy and frozen, produce, body care and receiving departments, as well as several non-management employees. The store manager is responsible for monthly store profit and loss, including labor, merchandising and inventory costs.
 
To ensure a high level of service, all employees receive training and guidance on customer service skills, product attributes and nutrition education. Employees are carefully trained and evaluated based on a requirement that they present nutrition information in an appropriate and legally compliant educational context while interacting with customers. Additionally, store employees are cross-trained in various functions, including cashier duties, stocking and receiving product.
 
Inventory. We use a robust merchandise management and perpetual inventory system that values goods at average cost. We manage shelf stock based on weeks-on-hand relative to sales, resupply time and minimum economic order quantity.
 
Sourcing and Vendors. We source from approximately 250 suppliers, and offer over 4,000 brands. These suppliers range from small independent businesses to multi-national conglomerates. As of December 31, 2017, we purchased approximately 75% of the goods we sell from our top 20 suppliers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of our total purchases were from one vendor. We maintain good relations with all our suppliers and believe we have adequate alternative supply methods, including self-distribution.
 
We have longstanding relationships with our suppliers, and we require disclosure from them regarding quality, freshness, potency and safety data information. Our bulk food private label products are packaged by us in pre-packed sealed bags to help prevent contamination while in transit and in our stores. Unlike most of our competitors, most of our private label nuts, trail mix and flours are refrigerated in our warehouse and stores to maintain freshness.
 
Our Employees
 
Commitment to our employees is one of our five founding principles. Employees are eligible for health, long-term disability, vision and dental insurance coverage, as well as Company paid short-term disability and life insurance benefits, after they meet eligibility requirements. Additionally, our employees are offered a 401(k) retirement savings plan with discretionary contribution matching opportunities. This further offers our employees the opportunity to become more familiar with our products, which we believe improves the customer service our employees are able to provide. We believe these and other factors result in higher retention rates and encourage our employees to appreciate our culture, which helps them better promote our brand.

Our Customers
 
The growth in the natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industries and growing consumer interest in health and nutrition have led to an increase in our core customer base. We believe the demands for affordable, nutritious food and dietary supplements are shared attributes of our core customers, regardless of their socio-economic status. Additionally, we believe our core customers prefer a retail store environment that offers carefully selected natural and organic products and dietary supplements. Our customers tend to be interested in health and nutrition, and expect our store employees to be highly knowledgeable about these topics and related products.
Competition
 
The grocery and dietary supplement retail business is a large, fragmented and highly competitive industry, with few barriers to entry. Our competition varies by market and includes conventional supermarkets such as Publix and Winn-Dixie, mass or discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, natural and gourmet markets such as Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, specialty food retailers such as Trader Joe’s, independent health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers’ markets, food co-ops, mail order and online retailers and multi-level marketers. These businesses compete with us for customers on the basis of price, selection, quality, customer service, shopping experience or any combination of these or other factors. They also compete with us for products and locations. In addition, some of our competitors are expanding to offer a greater range of natural and organic foods. We believe our commitment to carrying only carefully vetted, affordably priced and high-quality natural and organic products and dietary supplements, as well as our focus on providing nutritional education, differentiate us in the industry and provide a competitive advantage.
Seasonality
 
Our business is active throughout the calendar year and does not experience significant fluctuation caused by seasonal changes in consumer purchasing.
 
Insurance and Risk Management
 
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to cover workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, employment practices liability, associate healthcare benefits and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements and providers on an ongoing basis.
Information Technology Systems
 
We have made significant investments in overhead and information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems.
 
Segment Information
 
We have two reporting segments, natural and organic retail stores (“Grocery”) and vapor products (“Vapor”), through which we conduct all of our business. 

Going Concern and Liquidity
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern and realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainties related to our going concern assessment. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.
 
We had a large number of warrants outstanding with features that made the warrants more debt-like than equity and could possibly result in cash outflows. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of approximately $9.9 million and had a working capital deficit of approximately $2.3 million. These factors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
During 2016 and early 2017, we took steps to mitigate these factors by:
 

1) | increasing the number of authorized shares to 750,000,000,000 shares so that there would be sufficient shares available for issuance should all the warrant holders exercise; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | entering into a Fifth Amended and Restated Series A Warrant Standstill Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”) with warrant holders effectively eliminating the possibility that warrant holders will exercise for anything other than shares, and 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The steps above substantially lowered our outstanding liabilities and resulted in the Company having positive equity. As a result, as of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, we believe our plans have alleviated substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to sustain operations for the foreseeable future through a year and a day from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
