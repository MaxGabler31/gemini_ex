ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brookfield Property REIT Inc., formerly known as GGP Inc. ("BPR" or the "Company"), and related notes, as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). The terms "we", "us" and "our" may also be used to refer to BPR and its subsidiaries. BPR, a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 2010 and is an externally-managed real estate investment trust, referred to as a "REIT". BPR is a subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ("BPY").
As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 26, 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved a series of transactions (collectively, the "BPY Transaction") pursuant to which, among other things, (i) BPY would exchange all of its shares of the Company’s common stock owned by certain affiliates of BPY and any subsidiary of the Company for shares of a newly authorized series of preferred stock of the Company designated Series B Preferred Stock (the "Class B Exchange"), (ii) the Company’s certificate of incorporation would be amended and restated to, among other things, change the Company’s name from GGP Inc. to Brookfield Property REIT Inc. and authorize the issuance of Class A Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Stock"), Class B-1 Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B-1 Stock") and Class C Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class C Stock") and to provide the terms governing the Series B Preferred Stock and Class B-1 Stock (collectively, "Class B Stock"), and (iii) a special dividend would be paid to all holders of record of the Company’s common stock (not including holders of restricted stock, but including certain holders of options who are deemed stockholders) following the Class B Exchange (the "Pre-Closing Dividend"). The Pre-Closing Dividend would consist of a distribution of up to $23.50 in cash or a choice of either one BPY limited partnership unit ("BPY unit") or one share of Class A Stock, subject to proration in each case, based on an aggregate cash consideration amount of $9.25 billion. Each share of Class A Stock would be intended to provide an economic return equivalent to one BPY unit, and would be exchangeable for one BPY unit or its cash equivalent (the form of payment to be determined by BP US REIT LLC ("BPUS"), an affiliate of BPY, in its sole discretion). The BPY Transaction was completed on August 28, 2018. All references in this report to "BPR" or the "Company" prior to such date refer to the Company prior to the effect of the BPY Transaction.
Our Company and Strategy
Our primary business is owning and operating best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers, consumers and stockholders. BPR (NASDAQ: BPR) is a subsidiary of BPY (NASDAQ: BPY; TSX: BPY.UN) one of the world’s largest commercial real estate companies, with approximately $87 billion in total assets. BPR's Class A Stock was created as a public security that is intended to offer economic equivalence to an investment in BPY in the form of a U.S. REIT stock.
We own a property portfolio comprised primarily of Class A retail properties (defined primarily by sales per square foot). As of December 31, 2018, we own, either entirely or with joint venture partners, 124 retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately 121 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA").
Our primary objective is to be an owner and operator of best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers and consumers. Our strategy includes:

• | increasing the permanent occupancy of our regional mall portfolio by converting temporary leases to permanent leases and leasing vacant space;


• | renewing or replacing expiring leases at greater rental rates;


• | actively recycling capital through the disposition of assets and investing in whole or partial interests in high-quality regional malls, anchor pads, our development pipeline and repaying debt; and


• | continuing to execute on our existing redevelopment projects and seeking additional opportunities within our portfolio for redevelopment.

As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio was 96.5% leased, compared to 96.7% leased at December 31, 2017. On a suite-to-suite basis, the leases commencing in the trailing 12 months exhibited initial rents that were 10.6% higher than the final rents paid on expiring leases.

Segments
We operate in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation, development and management of retail and other rental properties. Our portfolio is targeted to a range of market sizes and consumer tastes. Each of our operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual property operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of a team of several members of executive management who use property operations in assessing segment operating performance. We do not distinguish or group our consolidated operations based on geography, size or type for purposes of making property operating decisions. Our operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to our tenants. There are no individual operating segments that are greater than 10% of combined revenue or combined assets. When assessing segment operating performance, certain non-cash and non-comparable items such as straight-line rent, depreciation expense and intangible asset and liability amortization, are excluded from property operations, which are a result of our emergence, acquisition accounting and other capital contribution or restructuring events. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than 10% of consolidated revenues. As a result, the Company's operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest tenant, L Brands, Inc. (based on common parent ownership), accounted for approximately 3.8% of rents. Our three largest tenants, L Brands, Inc., Foot Locker, Inc., and The Gap, Inc., in aggregate, comprised approximately 9.2% of rents.
Competition
Competition within the retail property sector is strong. We compete for tenants and visitors to our malls with other malls in close proximity as well as online retailers. We believe the high-quality nature of our properties enables us to compete effectively for retailers and consumers. In order to maintain and increase our competitive position within a marketplace we:

• | strategically locate tenants within each property to achieve a merchandising strategy that promotes traffic, cross-shopping and maximizes sales;


• | introduce new concepts to the property which may include restaurants, theaters, grocery stores, first-to-market retailers, and e-commerce retailers;


• | utilize our properties with the opportunities to add other potential uses such as residential, hospitality and office space to complement our retail experience;


• | invest capital to provide the right environment for our tenants and consumers, including aesthetic, technological, and infrastructure improvements; and


• | ensure our properties are clean, secure and comfortable.

See Item 1A - "Risk Factors" for additional discussion of our competitive environment. 
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real estate may be liable for the costs of remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation may be substantial and may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or borrow against such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we, or the relevant joint venture through which the property is owned, may be liable for such costs.
Substantially all of our properties have been subject to a Phase I environmental site assessment, which is intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the subject property and its surroundings. Phase I environmental assessments typically include a historical review, a public records review, a site visit and interviews, but do not include sampling or subsurface investigations.
As of December 31, 2018, the Phase I environmental site assessments have not revealed any environmental conditions that would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that

these assessments do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities or that conditions have changed since the assessment was prepared (typically, at the time the property was purchased or developed).
See Risk Factors regarding additional discussion of environmental matters.
Seasonality
Although we have a year-long temporary leasing program, occupancies for short-term tenants and, therefore, rental income recognized, are higher during the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, the majority of our tenants have December or January lease years for purposes of calculating annual overage rent amounts. Accordingly, overage rent thresholds are most commonly achieved in the fourth quarter. As a result, revenue production is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
Employees
While certain of our subsidiaries have employees, BPR does not have any employees. BPR has entered into a Master Services Agreement dated August 27, 2018, among Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ("Brookfield Asset Management" or “BAM”), the Company and certain other parties thereto (the “Master Services Agreement”) pursuant to which each service provider and certain other affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management provide, or arrange for other service providers to provide, day-to-day management and administrative services for our Company. See Exhibit 10.37 for this Master Service Agreement.
Insurance
We have comprehensive liability, property and rental loss insurance with respect to our portfolio of properties. We believe that such insurance provides adequate coverage.
Qualification as a REIT
The Company intends to maintain REIT status, and therefore our operations generally will not be subject to federal income tax on real estate investment trust taxable income. A schedule detailing the taxability of dividends for 2018, 2017 and 2016 has been presented in Note 7.
