ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Business of Issuer
 
The business of Regenerex Pharma, Inc., (the “Company” or “Regenerex Pharma,”), is to develop and market Woundcare Healing products. The Company has three technologies for different types of wound conditions:

• | The first is for closing chronic wounds,
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the second is for accelerating closure of acute or surgical wounds, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the third solves the issue on contamination of all types of wounds including the destruction of biofilms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The current product technology provides the Company a number of complete wound care protocols to treat all wounds, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns and surgical wounds.  These unique products strategically position the Company to enter and capture a high proportionate market share in the U.S. and global markets.
 
Products:
 

1. | Xcellderma OTC - Liquid Bandage Skin Protectant Xcellderma™ products are sterile wound dressings and are effective for treating diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and other chronic wounds. During the last several years, a scientific and medical consensus has emerged that elevated protease levels impede wound healing. QBx™ the active ingredient down regulates the production of certain proteases and matrix metalloproteases, or MMPs, which are protein enzymes that are proven to impede the healing of a majority of chronic wounds. Approximately 80% of chronic wounds display elevated levels of proteases (including MMPs).

2. | Accelerex Sterile Wound Cream - The first commercially available medical device, Accelerex, is for the treatment of a wide variety of chronic and acute wounds. Accelerex is a custom-designed, FDA and CE approved unit-dose, sterile wound dressing impregnated with an ointment containing QBx. Chronic wounds are generally defined as wounds that have not healed after thirty days of consistent clinical treatment, and include diabetic ulcers, burns, pressure ulcers (bedsores), and venous stasis ulcers. The Company’s broadly-enabling technology was discovered from oak bark extract and referred to as QBx™.

3. | Accelerex Impregnated Sterile Wound Dressing - For use as a wound dressing to manage pressure ulcers (stages I-IV), stasis ulcers, diabetic skin ulcers, skin irritations, cuts, and abrasions. FDA-cleared, prescription-only combination device that blends the benefits of a wound dressing with two drug components. Provides three modes of action to help treat acute and chronic wounds: Protective dressing, moisturizing ointment and two drug components: rubidium chloride and potassium chloride.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
QBx™ contributes to setting up a suitable environment to allow wounds to close.  Other than the products marketed by the Company, there are no products currently available on the market that are successful in healing chronic, non-healing wounds through the down regulation of proteases.  Other modern wound dressings such as hydrocolloids and collagens absorb wound fluids, but these dressings do not impact the cellular environment with simple gauze and gauze-like dressings to cover and protect the wound.
 
Our products have shown to be very effective in healing chronic wounds in multiple clinical evaluations, with 63% to 94% of wounds demonstrating closure.  All of our products feature our proprietary QBx™ ingredients which contribute to setting up a suitable environment to allow wounds to close.
 
Wounds that do not heal remain open and are at risk for infection.  The lack of healing ultimately could lead to amputation, severe medical complications, and in some cases, death.  Closing wounds is a paramount concern to health care professionals and patients alike.

Chronic wounds impose significant costs to the US economy.  Chronic wounds are a growing issue in the United States, causing immense patient pain and suffering as well as substantial economic and social cost.  Although precise information on the prevalence of chronic wounds in the US is unavailable, it is estimated that, as of 2021, there were more than 8.3 million Americans suffering from chronic wounds.  Chronic wounds are generally defined as wounds that have not healed after ninety days of consistent clinical treatment, and include diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers (bedsores), and venous stasis ulcers, however this does not include acute wounds.
 
The most common chronic wounds are diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers.  The increasing number of Americans with diabetes and obesity we well as the aging population will likely cause the number of individuals with chronic wounds to continue to rise.  In addition to the immeasurable human benefits of improving treatment outcomes, there would be substantial economic effect.  The costs of medical treatment could be expected to decrease, and, as patients are able to return to work sooner, productivity would increase.
 
Due to the staggering costs associated with chronic wounds in the US, the Affordable Healthcare Act (AHA) is changing how the entire wound care system is reimbursed in the US. Now all four markets segments: hospital, nursing homes, home health, and general wound care clinics are all on paid on a “pay for performance basis.”  These cost pressures in the healthcare system are a major issue in the wound care market, with the US government and payors seeking new approaches that address cost constraints and product performance.  Home health is now paid on a “diagnostic code” for the wound in single payments removing the risk from the Payee to the Payer.  The Company’s first markets will be those segments that are totally “at risk” for single payments to close the wounds.  Today, the fastest growing segment in the US wound market is Home Health and Nursing Homes due to the aging population.
 
The Company has purchased proprietary wound care formulations, and the Company plans to use internationally recognized experts in the manufacturing of specialized, professional quality products that meet the demands of the USA markets.  We expect to launch our sales initiative during the Company’s second quarter of 2023.
