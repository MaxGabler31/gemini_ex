Overview
 
We are a technology-based company that is focused on addressing the global constraints on natural resources, including fuel and water. Our two core technology applications – renewable fuel gasification and water decontamination/sterilization - are derived from our patented and proprietary Plasma Arc Flow System. The Plasma Arc Flow System works by generating a combination of electric current, heat, ultraviolet light and ozone, that affects the feedstock run through the system to create a chosen outcome, depending on whether the system is in “gasification mode” or “sterilization mode”.
Gasification Mode
 
When the Plasma Arc Flow System is in “gasification mode” and the appropriate feedstock is passed through the system in a closed loop with constant recirculation (to achieve the maximum possible gasification rates), it creates a renewable, hydrogen-based synthetic fuel we call “MagneGas”. We sell MagneGas as a metal cutting fuel as an alternative product to acetylene, which is the most commonly used metal fuel globally, but also happens to be a non-renewable fossil fuel-based metal cutting fuel. Alternatively, MagneGas is a cleaner, renewable fuel alternative that creates a flame up to 85% hotter than acetylene and cuts metal up to 38% faster than acetylene, while maintaining a comparable price.
Sterilization Mode
 
When the Plasma Arc Flow System is in “sterilization mode”, the system may process any number of liquified waste streams. In most cases we pass the selected waste stream through the system a limited number of times to achieve the maximum sterilization/decontamination effect on the waste stream. Sterilization mode also produces modest amounts of gas as a byproduct. Our proprietary combination of electric current, heat, ultraviolet light and ozone has shown an ability to eliminate up to 99.9% of EPA and USDA regulated pathogens such as e-coli and fecal coliform. We also believe our technology has the capability to eliminate cyanobacteria commonly referred to as “blue-green algae” and are currently conducting tests to verify that capability.

During 2018 and 2017, as part of our retail growth strategy, we acquired a number of businesses with large customer bases through which we now offer our proprietary MagneGas product in addition to other gases and welding supplies. The majority of our retail locations are in Texas and California, which we believe are the two top markets for consumption of metal cutting fuels and related supplies. We also have locations in Florida and Louisiana. We also market, for sale and licensure, our proprietary plasma arc technology for gasification and the processing of liquid waste and have developed a global network of brokers to sell the Plasma Arc Flow System.
 
Core Technology
 

Submerged Plasma Arc Flow System Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ● | Our patented system enables fluid to efficiently pass through a submerged plasma arc. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To create synthetic fuel, the fluid must contain hydrogen and oxygen – carbon supply can be facilitated by the electrodes. 
● | As the fluid passes through the arc, hydrogen, carbon and oxygen molecules are liberated and gasified. 
● | A wide range of feedstocks can produce different gases, with differing flame and heating properties 
● | Typically, our fuels are 40-60% ionized hydrogen and 30-40% other synthetic hydrocarbon and carbon compounds. 
● | To decontaminate or sterilize waste streams, such as contaminated water or biomass waste, the “feed stock” must be in liquid form. 

Our Products
 
We have two proprietary products that we market and sell, which are derived from our core technology. The first is our clean, renewable alternative cutting fuel called “MagneGas”, which is sold at our various locations to retail end users as an alternative product to acetylene. The second is our Plasma Arc Flow System, which is marketed for sale and licensure to commercial operators who desire to utilize our technology for gas production (under strict license) or water decontamination and sterilization.
MagneGas Cutting Fuel
 
We currently produce MagneGas, which is comprised primarily of hydrogen and created through a patented protected process. The fuel can be used as an alternative to acetylene and other natural gas derived fuels for metal cutting and other commercial uses. After production, the fuel is stored in hydrogen cylinders which are then sold to market on a rotating basis. Independent analyses performed by the City College of New York and Edison Welding Institute have verified that MagneGas cuts metal at a significantly higher temperature and faster than acetylene, which is the most commonly used fuel in metal cutting. The use of MagneGas is nearly identical to acetylene (it merely requires a different welding tip and a regulator) making it easy for end-users to adopt our product with limited training.

Over the last several years we have acquired and maintain a retail distribution network, which allows us to sell and transport MagneGas to customers in various metalworking industries. Since 2017, we have doubled the range we are able to distribute MagneGas and are now able to more efficiently address markets within a 500-mile radius of our production hubs in Florida and Texas. Within the next two years, we plan to create two production hubs in California to serve the western United States. Finally, we have and intend to continue to acquire complementary gas and welding supply distribution businesses in order to expand the distribution and use of MagneGas, other industrial gases and related equipment. We have sold to over 30,000 customers in the public and private sectors.
 
Plasma Arc Flow System
 
We use our Plasma Arc Flow System to make MagneGas, but it has the ability to gasify many forms of liquids and liquid waste such as used vegetable, soybean or motor oils, certain types of liquified biomass, ethylene glycol and can be used to sterilize bio-contaminants in waste and decontaminate water.
 
The Plasma Arc Flow System forces a high-volume flow of liquid waste through a submerged plasma arc existing between carbon electrodes, a process which sterilizes the bio-contaminants within the waste without requiring any chemical disinfecting agents. The Plasma Arc Flow System also releases a clean burning fuel as a byproduct of the decontamination and sterilization process, which can be used to offset some energy consumption. Because our Plasma Arc Flow Systems are available in various sizes from 50kW to 500kW, they are applicable to a broad array of end-users, including: (i) large consumers of cutting fuels (construction companies, shipbuilders, heavy industry) who desire a safer, renewable, and efficient alternative to acetylene and propane, (ii) producers of contaminated waste streams (commercial manufacturers, farming operations, chemical producers, etc.) who either desire to or are mandated by law to treat agricultural, pharmaceutical, industrial or manufacturing waste streams prior to release into the ecosystem and (iii) local, state or federal governments, desirous of decontaminating water sources or reclaiming waste water that is otherwise unusable.
 
Our Strategy
 
We strive to be a leading clean technology company. We seek to accomplish this goal through commercialization of our existing proprietary products, and research and development to improve upon these products and discover new products or applications. To help commercialize the use of MagneGas, over the last several years we have acquired a number of independent welding supply and gas distribution businesses, which now offer MagneGas as an alternative to acetylene in 22 retail locations across the United States. We will continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisition targets to enhance our organic based growth model. To further the commercialization of our Plasma Arc Flow Systems for decontamination and sterilization, we have applied for and have been awarded two grants from the United States Department of Agriculture and have successfully completed a number of pilot studies and plan to open a commercial sterilization and decontamination facility in the United States within the next year.
 
Our research and development activities are focused on:
 

● | the potential ability to use the Plasma Arc Flow System for the processing of agricultural waste and for the elimination of cyanobacteria, commonly referred to as “blue-green algae”; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | proving and scaling the utility of our Plasma Arc Flow System on a large-scale industrial basis; 
● | increased system efficiency for higher fuel production. 

 
For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, we experienced the following significant developments:
 

● | We formed NG Enterprises Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary we used to acquire all of the assets of GGNG Enterprises, LLC, a San Diego, California based welding supply and gas distribution business, and commenced business operations in Southern California doing business under the name “Complete Welding of San Diego”; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We formed MWS Green Arc Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary we used to acquire all of the assets of Green Arc Supply, L.L.C, an industrial gas and welding supply distributor and commenced business operations in Texas and Louisiana doing business under the name “Green Arc Supply”; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We acquired all of the capital stock of Trico Welding Supplies, Inc., an industrial gas and welding supply distributor with two locations in Sacramento, California, and commenced business operations in Northern California doing business under the name “Trico Welding Supplies”; 
● | We formed MagneGas Limited, a United Kingdom-based subsidiary, for the purpose of applying for grants and government financing in the United Kingdom; no grants have been obtained as of December 31, 2018 
● | We formed MagneGas Ireland Ltd., an Ireland-based subsidiary for the purpose of applying for grants and government financing and expanding business development efforts in the European Union and greater Middle East; no grants have been obtained as of December 31, 2018 
● | Our joint venture partner, Infinite Fuels, was awarded a $6.87 million grant from the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, a department within the European Commission; 
● | We acquired all of the capital stock of Paris Oxygen, Inc., a welding supply and gas distribution business located in Paris, Texas and commenced business operations in that location; 
● | We acquired all of the capital stock of Latex Welding Supply, Inc. a welding supply and gas distribution business located in Shreveport, Louisiana and commenced business operations in that location; and, 
● | We acquired all of the capital stock of United Welding Specialties of Longview, Inc., a welding supply and gas distribution business located in Longview, Texas and commenced business operations in that location. 

Our Distribution & Sales Network
 
We distribute and sell our MagneGas fuel, other gases and welding supplies at our retail locations in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and California through a select network of independent welding supply distributors. We use our retail industrial gas and welding supply subsidiaries as a platform to accelerate MagneGas fuel sales into regional markets. Our Plasma Arc Flow System is distributed directly by the Company and marketed and/or sold via a network of international brokers. 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
The competitive landscape in which our welding supply and gas distribution business operates is comprised of several major international conglomerates, such as Airgas, Linde, Air Products and Praxair and a number of smaller independent distributors which compete for market share in certain geographical areas. We believe that the superior qualities of MagneGas are a market differentiator which allow us to compete with both large conglomerates and smaller distributors.
 
The competitive landscape in which the Plasma Arc Flow System may be utilized for waste water decontamination and sterilization is relatively undeveloped and we are not aware of any direct competitors at this time.

We believe that our current operations are fully compliant with applicable local, state and federal regulations.
 
We are also regulated by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. We believe that our current operations are fully compliant with OSHA and comparable state statutes.
 
Research and Development
 
Plasma Arc Flow System for Agricultural Sterilization and Decontamination
 
Through years of research and development, we have determined our Plasma Arc Flow System can be modified to process a number of feedstocks, including animal biosolid waste and other liquified waste streams. We have conducted several successful tests of the Plasma Arc Flow System at a large hog farm in Indiana and dairy farm in Florida for the processing, sterilization and decontamination of agricultural waste streams. These tests, which achieved full sterilization of the manures processed through the Plasma Arc Flow System, were conducted with variable flow and efficiency rates, demonstrating the versatility of the Plasma Arc Flow System.
 
Notably, on June 13, 2017, we were awarded a $431,874 grant from the USDA, which is being used to accelerate the commercialization of the Plasma Arc Flow System for the treatment of pathogens and nutrients found in animal bio-solid wastes. The Company successfully launched its first grant-funded operations at a dairy farm in Bowling Green, Florida in December 2017, and held its first successful demonstration to the USDA in May 2018.
 
In September 2018, the Company initiated the second phase of its 18-month, USDA grant-funded sterilization project. The second phase of the sterilization project will expand the scope of pathogens and living organisms tested for sterilization efficacy. The project will also expand the study of efficacy in breaking down pharmaceutical wastes trapped in associated waste water. Lastly, the second phase of the project will significantly expand the study of the waste solids processed using the Company’s Plasma Arc Flow System. The second phase of testing on site in Bowling Green, Florida is expected to run through early October 2019.
 
Increased System Efficiency for Greater Fuel Output
 
We continue to conduct ongoing research to discover methods to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the production of our fuels. Since 2012, we have reduced our production costs by 88% and are working diligently to reduce costs by another 50% in the next 12 months, which we believe will enable us to out-price acetylene producers. Additionally, we are also exploring other power systems and filtration systems as well as the potential ability to convert certain byproducts into electricity.
 
During the last two fiscal years, we typically had 3 to 6 full-time employees working on research and development projects.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 87 full-time employees. We have occasionally used temporary employees and independent contractors to perform production and other duties. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent.
