Item 1. Business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this subsection to “MarketWise,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the business of MarketWise, LLC and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and to the business of MarketWise Inc. and its subsidiaries after the Closing.
We started in 1999 with the simple idea that, if we could publish intelligent, independent, insightful, and in-depth investment research and treat the subscriber the way we would want to be treated, then subscribers would renew their subscriptions and stay with us. That simple idea worked and has guided our decisions ever since.
Today, we are a leading multi-brand platform of subscription businesses that provides premium financial research, software, education, and tools for self-directed investors. We provide our subscribers with the research, education, and tools that they need to navigate the financial markets.
We have evolved significantly since our inception in 1999.
Over the years, we have expanded our business into a comprehensive suite of investment research products and solutions. We now produce a diversified product portfolio from a variety of financial research companies such as Stansberry Research, Palm Beach Research Group, TradeSmith, Casey Research, InvestorPlace, and Empire Financial Research. Our entire investment research product portfolio is 100% digital and channel agnostic. We offer our research across a variety of platforms, including desktop, laptop, and mobile devices, including tablets and mobile phones.
As a result of the expansion of the business, we now have 98 editors and analysts covering a broad spectrum of investments, ranging from commodities to equities, to distressed debt and cryptocurrencies. We offer 42 free and 135 paid products on multiple platforms through our 12 customer-facing brands. This diversity of content has allowed our business to succeed and our subscription base to grow through the many economic cycles in our over 20-year history.
We have an engaged subscriber base of approximately 972 thousand Paid Subscribers and a large and growing audience of over 13.7 million Free Subscribers. 
Millions of Investors are Taking Control of Their Finances, and We Have the Content and Tools to be Their Guide
The nature of retail investing is rapidly changing, and we are taking advantage of these trends.
Rise of the self-directed investor. Years ago, and even today, retail investors sought advice from traditional investment managers. But over the past two decades, retail investors have increasingly taken control of their own portfolios. There are several reasons for this trend. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investor skepticism increased toward large financial institutions and advisors. Meanwhile, the development of online trading and the proliferation of financial information on the Internet has made it easier for investors to take control of their finances and self-direct their investments. Online brokerage platforms have slashed the cost to manage a personal trading account, so investors can now make trades for free or at a fraction of the historical cost.
As a result, the U.S. self-directed investor population is approximately 75 million people in 2021. And this self-directed population is growing by nearly 15% each year, and is expected to increase to approximately 115 million investors by 2024.
These factors have combined to motivate individual investors to take control of their investment decision-making. These self-directed investors tend to lag the market indices so they seek the expert information to educate and empower themselves to manage their own portfolios. As more investors take the self-directed approach to managing their financial future, there is significant demand for investment ideas, education, and market intelligence.
Demographic shifts are increasing demand for our products. Approximately 17% of the U.S. population are individuals over the age of 65. And that cohort is growing rapidly, with roughly 10,000 Americans retiring every day. Many of these people have significant retirement accounts on which they rely. 
In addition, 72% of Millennials—people born between 1980 and 1994—identify themselves as “self-directed” investors. As the Millennials continue to age and grow their investment portfolios, we have a significant opportunity to serve that demographic and grow our business.
Financial markets are becoming more complex. The historical approach toward managing a personal portfolio with a mix of blue-chip stocks, corporate bonds, and cash has become antiquated. The rapid growth of investment opportunities—including products such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), cryptocurrencies, options strategies, and distressed corporate debt—has given self-directed investors today many different and sophisticated ways to invest their money. And those choices continue to specialize and multiply. 
As investment options in the global financial markets increase, it becomes harder and harder for investors to stay informed and keep up with the strategies available to them. We and our teams of editors and analysts are constantly surveying the markets for new strategies to help subscribers stay current with the changing markets.
Financial research content is fragmented and price points vary. The landscape of financial research providers is fragmented, with hundreds of publications, platforms, and tools for investment research directed at distinct segments of the investing community.
Financial research providers range from free, advertising-supported platforms or crowdsourced investment websites to low-cost, “mom and pop” newsletter subscription services, many of which do not produce content at scale. There are also extremely expensive, subscription-based software platforms with data and tools designed for highly sophisticated institutional investors. 
Our Value Proposition
We empower retail investors with institutional-quality research at a price point that is accessible.
Experienced analysts, with their own unique investment strategies and philosophies, lead our franchise brands. As a result, we do not promote a single, unified view of the markets, but instead we publish a mosaic of opinions, recommendations, and strategies.
This multi-franchise approach gives our work far greater breadth, creating more diverse opportunities for our subscribers. Our franchises are linked, however, by a continuous commitment to risk management and a contrarian approach to identifying investment opportunities.
Across all our franchises, we focus on investments that are unloved, ignored, or unknown. Having an informed perspective in these situations gives our subscribers the best risk-to-reward opportunities.
We recognize that self-directed investors do not have the same research budget and resources at their disposal as institutional investors do. So we strive to provide them with institutional quality research at affordable price points. Unlike traditional institutional research, our offerings are significantly less expensive and more accessible. They are designed to be less technical and therefore more easily understood by the subscribers who aren’t finance professionals. At the same time, our offerings have premium content that is highly actionable.
We believe that if we publish research to help our subscribers succeed in the financial markets, they will progressively become better investors, renew their subscriptions, and become long-term customers. We have proven out this thesis throughout our over 20-year history. We have formed lifelong relationships with our subscribers by providing superior value through our offerings.
We provide a comprehensive suite of research and software solutions. 
Through 12 primary customer facing brands, we have 42 free products and 135 paid products. To date, we have chosen not to combine our franchises and primary customer facing brands into one company, primarily out of consideration for the readers. We find that our subscribers develop personal affinities for specific writers and certain investment styles. We want to avoid disrupting those relationships by interjecting a new company name or persona. That dynamic is especially true when it comes to our joint ventures and acquisitions, which we engage in periodically, where subscribers may not have any prior relationship with us. 
We cover various investment strategies, such as value investing, income, growth, commodities, cryptocurrencies, venture, biotechnology, mutual funds, options, and trading. We typically publish our research reports on a monthly basis, although some of our products publish more frequently. We offer our entire investment research product portfolio across a variety of media, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile.
We also offer financial software and analytical tools. 
We continue to expand our research portfolio with software and analytical tool solutions.
Among these are TradeSmith and the Altimeter, which represented 9% of our Billings on average from 2019 to 2021. TradeSmith provides a full suite of portfolio management software tools that enable individual investors to manage their portfolios using algorithms that have been back tested for results and designed to help investors manage their emotions. The Altimeter is a user-friendly database showing uniform, accounting-based financial summaries for more than 5,400 companies.
We acquired Chaikin Analytics in January 2021 to further expand our portfolio of software and analytical tools and increase the number of our customers in the registered investment advisor market.
We have also developed a digital research platform for the self-directed investor that we refer to as the “terminal.” For the individual investor, the terminal integrates our content with public financial data in a well-designed user interface. It provides our users with a valuable tool to easily consume our research, keep track of investments, import their portfolios and more. Through the terminal, subscribers have instant access to real-time data across more than 6,000 U.S. equities, plus daily prices on 50,000 international equities and 25,000 U.S. corporate bonds. Also included is a 24-hour financial news feed that is updated in real time, giving users a glimpse into updated market news, trends and data across multiple devices.
We have developed screeners, monitors, portfolio management tools, and a set of proprietary indicators that produce a composite score to rank several thousand publicly traded companies in the United States. The terminal is also designed to appeal to professional registered investment advisors. It combines vast amounts of financial data and third-party content with our proprietary research.
These product offerings reinforce each other and produce a strong flywheel effect across our organization. As we launch or buy more products, we increase the tools available to our readers and the value we provide to our existing subscribers. This allows us to gather insights and feedback and helps us create new products and solutions.
We are dedicated to honoring our long-term commitment to subscribers.
We believe investing is a lifelong endeavor—one that requires constant learning, course corrections, openness to change, and emotional discipline. In keeping with this core belief, we strive to build long-term relationships with our subscribers.
We believe in publishing content that is educational, informative, and easy to understand, and therefore helps our subscribers become better investors over time. This reinforces our lifelong relationships with our subscribers as they can grow with our platform. This forms a “virtuous cycle” of learning and improving through our offerings. As subscribers learn more about how to manage their investments, that makes them more comfortable with investigating the more specialized content covered in our high-end services, which further encourages them to continue broadening their investing skill set.
Our market leadership, scale, and access to a wide set of subscribers creates strong network effects. As we grow, we have larger budgets, which allows us to reinvest back into our research platform by hiring more analysts, developing more software and tools, and launching new products, which, in turn, helps us attract more subscribers to our platform.
We are committed and continue to invest in our subscriber experience.
Our relationship with our subscribers is our most precious asset, and we strive to put the customer first in everything that we do. This customer-centric focus drives us to constantly upgrade the quality, breadth, and depth of our research in our existing products without materially increasing the cost of the subscription.
This approach also greatly affects how our customer service groups treat our subscribers when issues arise. We instill in our teams that if we cannot reasonably meet the subscriber’s expectations, then we should ask the customer how we failed them, seek a mutually agreeable solution, and, if one cannot be found, offer them a refund or other form of compensation and find a way to part as friends. This has resulted in over 90% net revenue retention for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 across our products.
Our Growth Strategy
We are committed to growing our business by deepening our relationship with existing customers and attracting new subscribers to our platform. We did both last year. We will also pursue strategic growth as opportunities arise. Here’s how we grow our business:
Attract more subscribers. We typically acquire new subscribers through an omni-channel marketing strategy that includes display ads, email, external subscriber lists, and direct mail, as well as television and radio at times. We primarily market in these channels through free-to-paid and direct-to-paid content.
We measure our customer-acquisition performance by a matrix of new customer counts and the cost to acquire customers. The mix of our marketing spend across these channels varies among our primary customer-facing brands and depends on how well individual marketing campaigns succeed, the nature of the product, and the type of offer.
We have invested significant resources into our efforts around consumer marketing, including enterprise-wide customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, the leveraging of artificial intelligence (“AI”) to analyze this data, and a robust database of customer information.
In all of our marketing efforts, we collect and analyze customer response data by channel and effort, down to the individual advertisement in a marketing campaign. Using this data-driven and time-tested approach, we have developed proprietary practices for customer acquisition that we believe set us apart from other companies.
As we develop our relationship with the customer, we collect information from our subscribers about what products they are purchasing, their customer experience, and any feedback they have on our free and paid products. We use this information to deepen the customer experience and present offers to our subscribers for other products that they are likely to find interesting and useful.
Deepen our relationship with our existing subscribers. In addition to our paid customers, an additional 13.7 million Free Subscribers have access to our extensive library of free and educational content. As our subscribers learn and gain confidence as investors, they understand the need to deploy diverse investment strategies for different market conditions and they explore our broad and diverse product offerings. They gain an understanding of the high quality of research that we strive to provide, and they tend to purchase additional research and software products.
Our free subscription products serve as a significant source of new Paid Subscribers, with an average annual free-to-paid conversion rate of approximately 1% to 2% between 2019 and 2021. 
Launch new products and target new markets. Over our greater than 20-year history, we have developed a breadth of products and services that are designed to educate, empower, and entertain our subscribers and provide them with actionable investment ideas. 
We offer a wide array of paid subscription products, ranging from lower priced products (e.g., subscriptions that cost $100 annually) to more expensive products (e.g., subscriptions that can cost up to $5,000 annually). The length of our subscriptions can vary from one year to “lifetime,” where subscribers pay upfront for access to our specific products for the rest of their investing lives, then only pay an annual maintenance fee ranging from $49 to $500 per year.
We have also developed various software applications that provide customers with algorithmic tools to search for trading ideas and manage portfolio risk. We plan to extend the scale and reach of our offerings to include both retail and institutional investors in the future. We will continue to enhance our value proposition and create additional selling opportunities through an expanded product portfolio.
We also offer members-only investing conferences where subscribers interact with our editors and analysts and can network with each other. We have a strong track record of cultivating these relationships with our subscribers, and we intend to continue that going forward.
Selectively pursue strategic growth. Over the past ten years, we have developed several joint ventures and executed strategic acquisitions to accelerate our growth, as well as increase the value of our offerings to our subscribers.
We have a strong track record of driving growth and delivering value through the successful integration of acquisitions and joint ventures. We believe our large subscriber base, easy scalability, marketing expertise, technology-based platform, and integration capabilities provide opportunities for us to drive value-added growth through acquisitions in key areas such as product, market, and geographic expansion.
We have also made key investments across our platform to create a repeatable, low-cost, and scalable business model. We have invested in business functions from marketing to technology and developed several new products, including our terminal product.
We plan to continue investing in cutting-edge AI and advanced analytics-driven marketing tools to further optimize our marketing channels. Additionally, we have invested in our finance, technology, human resources, and other general and administrative functions to support our growth. 
Competition
The market for investment research and financial information software is evolving and is highly fragmented. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter those markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include:
•free online financial news aggregators or customer content platforms, like Yahoo! Finance and Seeking Alpha;
•traditional financial news publishers, like the Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily, and Barron’s;
•consumer-focused online subscription businesses, such as The Motley Fool;
•institutional financial software providers, such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and S&P Global; and
•online investing tools, such as Atom Finance and Stocktwits.
For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see Item 1A. Risk Factors —“We face significant competition. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have larger customer bases, more established brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, technological, and personnel resources than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, some of our competitors and potential competitors are better capitalized than we are and able to obtain capital more easily, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.”
Our Technology
We use technology to run our business efficiently and to better serve our customers. Our technology combines three cloud-based systems: software-as-a-service (“SaaS”); platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”); and infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”). 
While we have changed providers in the past and may do so in the future, we currently use top-tier, industry leading service providers for our CRM and marketing, email delivery, subscription billing, data warehouse, and for our data center.
Our infrastructure is highly scalable and allows us to serve all of our subscribers simultaneously and consistently. Our technology architecture is scalable based on overall traffic and capacity. As a result, we do not believe that growth in the number of subscribers hinders or slows down our platform.
We also employ data redundancy solutions on the cloud to reduce the possibility that our customer data will be lost and to ensure that our platform will not experience material downtime. We apply industry-standard data security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities in our technology.
We have invested heavily in providing a reliable and secure global platform and infrastructure. Our investments in technology, including engineers, online security, customer privacy, reliable infrastructure, and data science capabilities, enable us to efficiently innovate and deliver solutions to our customers. Our cloud platform allows our developers to build and deploy in a lean and agile fashion with a focus on quality and solution adoption.
We continue to build out our AI tools and predictive analytics capacity through identification of additional business cases and additional data features. While partnering with a nationally recognized provider, we have applied highly targetable demographic and behavioral attributes to new models and in existing models to further enhance our business value.
Our data center is cloud-based, and through this platform we have been able to integrate the various SaaS and PaaS applications within our technology ecosystem and ensure that we have high availability and redundancy with business continuity in mind in an auto-scaling architecture.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 800 full-time employees. Under normal circumstances, our employees and independent contractors work from our U.S. office locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement.
Our success depends on our relationships with our subscribers, as well as our employees. We believe that talented employees play a key role in delivering valuable content to our subscribers, which in turn, creates long-term value for our shareholders. 
We seek to attract and retain top talent through competitive compensation and benefit programs, and by fostering a culture of high performance, creativity, healthy work-life balance, and diverse perspectives that will enable our employees to thrive and be successful.
Our compensation programs include both fixed and variable components, an incentive award plan providing for equity grants, and an employee stock purchase plan, all of which we believe incentivizes our employees to achieve high performance, helps them establish long-term financial security, and encourages them to remain with us. 
Our benefits package includes health and welfare plans that provide medical, dental, and vision coverage, health savings accounts, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, life insurance, disability insurance, 401(k) savings plan with a company match, and other assistance and wellness programs. 
We have experienced tremendous growth—almost doubling our workforce since 2017. And, even in the midst of a very active and competitive employment market, our turnover rate for the last six months was only 9%. We are 
also proud that all three of our eligible subsidiaries were recognized as top workplaces by the Baltimore Sun in 2021, 2020 and 2019. One of our subsidiaries ranked in first place in mid-size employers in that same contest.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright to protect our intellectual property. We have registered certain of our trademarks and service marks in the United States with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and China, and have registered copyrights on certain publications. In addition, we have registered our domain names, including marketwise.com, with MarkMonitor. We believe the names and marks associated with our brands are of significant value and are important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we monitor the use of our marks and vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of the marks. We do not hold any patents.
We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality, nondisclosure, and non-interference agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential, and we limit access to our confidential and proprietary information to a “need to know” basis. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. In addition, our internal policies seek to protect our intellectual property against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.

On July 21, 2021, we consummated the transactions contemplated by that Business Combination Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2021, by and among Ascendant Digital Acquisition Corp., (“ADAC”), MarketWise, LLC, and the MarketWise Members, (as amended, the “Transaction Agreement”), which provided for: (1) the domestication of ADAC as a Delaware corporation; (2) ADAC’s capital contribution to MarketWise, LLC in exchange for certain units and warrants in MarketWise, LLC; and (3) the issuance of shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of MarketWise, Inc. to the MarketWise Members (the “Class B common stock” and, together with the Class A common stock, the “common stock”) (the transactions described above and all transactions contemplated by or pursuant to the Transaction Agreement collectively, the “Transactions”). Upon the closing of the Transactions, ADAC changed its name to “MarketWise, Inc.” and became the sole manager of MarketWise, LLC. MarketWise, Inc.’s only direct assets consist of MarketWise Units and warrants of MarketWise, LLC, and substantially all of the assets and the business of MarketWise, Inc. are held by MarketWise, LLC and its subsidiaries. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, ADAC’s Class A ordinary shares, warrants, and units ceased trading on The New York Stock Exchange, and MarketWise, Inc.’s Class A common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbols “MKTW” and “MKTW W,” respectively.
