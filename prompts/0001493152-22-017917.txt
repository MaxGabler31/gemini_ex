The Company has changed its focus to operate online advertising business through www.dazhong368.com (the “Website”) in the New York area.
 
The Website was established by Mr. Zhang in 2014 which is mainly focused on customers in the Greater New York area. The Website advertises different markets for professional individuals or companies including real estate, services, accounting, legal and so forth. We charge certain fees from these advertisements posted on our Website. The Company expects to generate revenue from the online advertising business and we also seek other profitable business at the same time.
 
Recent Developments
 
On September 6, 2019 the Company entered into a Stock Subscription Agreement (the “Stock Agreement”) with Sophia 33 Inc. which is 100% controlled by Mr. Dingshan Zhang. Pursuant to the Stock Agreement, the Company issued 10,000,000 common shares to Sophia 33 Inc. to exchange 100% ownership of www.dazhong368.com. The Website is a very popular advertising online platform in New York area, especially for the local Chinese community.
Products and Services
 
Our current services will focus on the website development, maintenance and online business advertisement. Meanwhile, we will also search for different business opportunities to be acquired by the Company.
 
We will continue to improve our online platform in order to expand our customer base. The potential customer resource of our online advertising platform will be mainly from professional individuals and small companies that will use our platform to promote their services or products to their end-users.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to target the small to medium-sized companies as well as the professional individuals that will use our Website to promote their products or services. Except to build up a customized ID card introduction for each of our customers, we will also help our customers to maintain their content information posted under their ID card introduction. We hope this one-stop service will better serve our potential customers.
Competitive Conditions
 
The online advertising industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services.
 
A few of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality service in a cost-effective manner. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors
