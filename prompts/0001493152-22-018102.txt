Item 1. Business.
History and Overview
 
Landbay Inc is a New York corporation formed on January 28, 2016. Our current principle executive office is located at 36-25 Main Street, Flushing, New York, 11354. Tel: 917-232-5799.
 
On July 24, 2019, Larison Inc, the principal stockholder and 100% controlled by the prior President of the Company (“Seller”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Northern Ifurniture Inc (the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the Agreement, Seller agreed to sell to the Buyer and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Seller a total of 9,222,350 shares of common stock of the Company Purchased Shares, which represented approximately 96% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, the transaction led to a change of the control and the management team of the Company.
 
Prior to the change of the management team, the Company was engaging in holding or trading securities in the US market, as well as to trade and hold whisky in the UK market. The Company has changed its focus to operate furniture retail business and furniture design business in the New York area.
 
The Board of the Directors approved to amend the Article of the Company to reduce the Company’s authorized common stock from 999,000,000 shares to 30,000,000 shares on August 15, 2019. On April 29, 2021, the Company amended its article with New York State to increase the authorized Class A common shares with a par value of $0.001 to 100,000,000 shares, and to add 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001.
 
The Company also continues to look for other opportunities which could potentially increase the profits of the Company in the year of 2022.
