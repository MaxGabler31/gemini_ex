ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 American Vanguard Corporation (“AVD”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 1969 and operates as a holding company. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company” or the “Registrant,” in this Annual Report refer to AVD. The Company conducts its business through its principle operating subsidiaries, including AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”) for its domestic business and AMVAC Netherlands BV (“AMVAC BV”) for its international business.
 The subsidiaries in the U.S. include: AMVAC, GemChem, Inc. (“GemChem”), Envance Technologies, LLC (“Envance”), TyraTech Inc. (“TyraTech”) and OHP Inc. (“OHP”). 
 Internationally, the Company operates its business through the following subsidiaries: AMVAC BV, AMVAC Hong Kong Limited (“AMVAC Hong Kong”), AMVAC Mexico Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC M”), AMVAC de Costa Rica Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC CR Srl”), AMVAC Singapore Pte, Ltd (“AMVAC Sgpr”), Grupo AgriCenter (including the parent AgriCenter S.A. and its subsidiaries) (“AgriCenter”), AMVAC do Brasil Representácoes Ltda (“AMVAC do Brasil”), AMVAC do Brazil 3p LTDA (“AMVAC 3p”), American Vanguard Australia PTY Ltd (“AVD Australia”), AgNova Technologies PTY Ltd (“AgNova”), and the Agrinos group (“Agrinos”).
 Based on similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s business is aggregated into one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7 for selective enterprise information.
 AMVAC is a California corporation that traces its history from 1945 and is a manufacturer of chemical, biological and biorational products that develops and markets solutions for agricultural, commercial and consumer uses. It synthesizes and formulates chemicals and ferments and extracts microbial products for crops, turf and ornamental plants, and human and animal health protection. These products, which include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, soil health, plant nutrition, molluscicides, growth regulators, and soil fumigants, are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular forms. AMVAC primarily synthesizes, formulates, and distributes its own proprietary products or custom manufactures, formulates or distributes for others. In addition, the Company has carved out a leadership position in closed delivery systems, currently offers certain of its products in SmartBox, Lock ‘n Load and EZ Load systems, and is commercializing a precision application technology known as SIMPAS (see “Intellectual Property” below) which permits the delivery of multiple products (from AMVAC and/or other companies) at variable rates in a single pass. AMVAC has historically expanded its business through both the acquisition of established chemistries, the development and commercialization of new formulations or compounds through licensing arrangements, self-funded research and development of precision application technology and the expansion of its global distribution network to gain broader market access. 
 AMVAC BV is a Netherlands Corporation that was established in 2012 and is based in Utrecht, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands. AMVAC BV sells product both directly and through its network of subsidiaries in various international territories. 
 Below is a description of the Company’s acquisition/licensing activity over the past three years. 
 On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets from Syngenta Crop Protection related to the herbicide trifloxysulfuron (Envoke), including end-use registrations, data compensation claims, trademarks, formulation know-how, and books and records.

On October 8, 2020, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, AVD Australia, completed the purchase of all the outstanding shares of AgNova, an Australian company that sources, develops, and distributes specialty crop protection and production solutions for agricultural and horticultural producers and for selected non-crop users. AgNova has an established reputation for cost-effective product development from original concept through evaluation, registration, marketing, and sales, with new technologies flowing from its development pipeline. AgNova is committed to the provision of innovative, value-adding solutions for agriculture and related industries. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, and existing working capital.
 On October 2, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, completed the purchase of all the outstanding shares of the Agrinos Group Companies (Agrinos) from  Agrinos AS, a Norwegian holding company, from a liquidation proceeding of that entity before a Norwegian bankruptcy court in Oslo, Norway. In addition to the shares of Agrinos, AMVAC acquired a bank of microbial and micronutrients, as well as about 150 pending or issued patents. Agrinos is a fully integrated biological input supplier with proprietary technology, manufacturing facilities, and global distribution capabilities. Its High Yield Technology® product platform works in conjunction with other nutritional crop inputs to increase crop yield, improve soil health and reduce the environmental footprint of traditional agricultural practices. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, two factories and existing working capital.
 On April 1, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, acquired 6,250,000 common shares of Clean Seed Capital Group Ltd. (Clean Seed), representing an ownership of approximately 8%. In addition, AMVAC licensed from Clean Seed certain intellectual property rights related to Clean Seed’s SMART planting technologies. 
 On December 20, 2019, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, completed the purchase of certain assets related to four herbicide products from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company for use in the U.S.. The purchased assets included end-use registrations, registration data, trademarks (specifically, Classic®, First Rate®, Python® and Hornet®), on-hand inventory, commercial sales information, know-how and certain product supply arrangements. 
 On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of three crop protection products for the U.S. market from Raymat Crop Science, Inc. and its affiliate, Esstar Crop Science, Inc. The acquired products are the miticide etoxazole (Stifle), the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron (Cavalier), and a rice herbicide bispyribac sodium (Arroz). The acquired assets included product registrations, trademarks and trade names, customer lists and associated on-hand inventory. 
 On January 10, 2019, the Company’s international subsidiary AMVAC do Brazil completed the purchase of the shares of Agrovant and Defensive, two distribution companies based in Brazil. Agrovant and Defensive market and distribute crop protection products and micronutrients with focus on the fruit and vegetable market segments throughout Brazil. The acquired entities held assets that consist of product registrations, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, and existing working capital. Agrovant and Defensive were merged in 2020 and renamed to AMVAC 3p. 
 Seasonality
 The agricultural chemical industry, in general, is cyclical in nature. The demand for AVD’s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage, however, does not necessarily follow calendar dates, but more closely follows growing patterns, weather conditions, geography, weather related pressure from pests and customer marketing programs. Further, growing seasons vary by geographical region; thus, there is no single seasonal cycle affecting our sales. Rather, multiple seasons transpire over the course of the calendar year.
Backlog
 AVD primarily sells its products based on purchase orders. The purchase orders are typically fulfilled within a short time frame. As a result, backlog is not considered a significant factor of, or a valid metric for, AVD’s business. The 2021 year, however, did end with a significantly larger than normal backlog of orders that is expected to result in a strong start to the 2022 financial year as demand for the Company’s products remains high.
Customers
 The Company’s largest three customers accounted for 17%, 14% and 8% of the Company’s sales in 2021; 17%, 12% and 10% in 2020; and 18%, 14% and 7% in 2019.

Distribution
 In the U.S. AMVAC predominantly distributes its products through national distribution companies and buying groups or co-operatives, which purchase AMVAC’s goods on a purchase order basis and, in turn, sell them to retailers/growers/end-users. 
 Internationally, AMVAC BV has sales offices or wholly owned distributors in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Australia, and India, and sales force executives or sales agents in several other territories. The Company’s domestic and international distributors, agents and customers typically have long-established relationships with retailers/end-users, far-reaching logistics, transportation capabilities and/or customer service expertise. The markets for AVD’s products vary by region, target crop, use and type of distribution channel. AVD’s customers are experts at addressing these various markets. 
 Competition
 In its many marketplaces, AVD faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than AVD. AVD’s capacity to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications (including delivery systems and precision application technologies) for its current products and/or expand its product lines and customer base. AVD competes principally based on quality, product efficacy, price, technical service and customer support. In some cases, AVD has positioned itself in smaller niche markets, which are no longer addressed by larger companies. In other cases, for example in the Midwest corn and soybean markets, the Company competes directly against larger competitors.
Manufacturing
 Through its six manufacturing facilities (see Item 2, Properties), AVD synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end-use products. Further, the Company formulates and packages its end-use products at four of its own facilities or at the facilities of third-party formulators in the U.S. and at various international locations. In addition, the Company owns two biological fermentation sites, one site in the U.S., and one in Mexico, and, in addition, has a product manufacturing arrangement at a third-party facility in India.
Raw Materials
 AVD utilizes numerous companies to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products. Many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources. In those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic, AVD seeks to secure its supply by either long-term (multi-year) arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers. Further, where the availability or cost of certain raw materials may be subject to the effect of tariffs and/or supply chain disruption, the Company may order goods at times or in volumes out of the ordinary course to optimize pricing and to ensure supply.
Intellectual Property
 AVD’s proprietary product formulations are protected, to the extent possible, as trade secrets and, to a lesser extent, by patents. Certain of the Company’s closed delivery systems are patented, and the Company has both pending and issued patents relating to its equipment portfolio, particularly with respect to its SIMPAS and ULTIMUS technology. In addition, the Company owns multiple issued patents relating to both its low-impact Envance solutions as well as its Agrinos biological and microbial solutions. Further, AVD’s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets. AVD considers that, in the aggregate, its product registrations, trademarks, licenses, customer lists and patents constitute valuable assets. While it does not regard its current business as being materially dependent upon any single product registration, trademark, license, or patent, it believes that patents will play an increasingly important role in its developmental equipment and green solution technologies.
 EPA Registrations
 In the U.S., AVD’s products also receive protection afforded by the terms of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), pursuant to which it is unlawful to sell any pesticide in the U.S., unless such pesticide has first been registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). Most of the Company’s products that are sold in the U.S. are subject to USEPA registration and periodic re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. This registration by USEPA is based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, when used according to approved label directions. In addition, each state requires a specific registration before any of AVD’s products can be marketed or used in that state. State registrations are predominantly renewed annually with a smaller number of registrations that are renewed on a multiple year basis. Foreign jurisdictions typically have similar registration requirements by statute.

In addition, certain of the Company’s biological products are labeled organic under the Organic Materials Review Institute (“OMRI”), Washington State Department of Agriculture (“WSDA”) and/or California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”)  and, as such, are subject to the requirements of those certification standards, including with respect to raw materials and processes. As is the case with synthetic products, these biological products are also subject to specific labeling requirements that may vary from state to state.
 The USEPA, state, and foreign agencies have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by AVD. AVD, on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing, required data relative to specific products. Under FIFRA, the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations, including in the case of adding labeled uses. This requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as regulatory compliance, with USEPA and other such bodies in the markets in which the Company sells its products. In addition, at times, the Company is required to generate new formulations of existing products and/or to produce new products in order to remain compliant. The Company expensed $16,568, $15,613 and $13,989, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on these activities.

Total | $ | 16,568 | | $ | 15,613 | | $ | 13,989

Environmental
 AVD is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at its six manufacturing facilities both in the U.S. and abroad. The Company continually adapts its manufacturing, storage, transportation, handling and disposal processes to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory and other agencies to which it is subject. The USEPA and other foreign, federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on the Company’s operations.
 AVD expends substantial funds to minimize the risk of discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment. Wherever feasible, the Company recovers and recycles raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs.
 The Company is committed to a long-term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns.
 Human Capital Resources
 We believe that, beyond being essential to our operations, our people have inestimable worth independent of our business. As outlined in our Human Rights Policy (see, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab), we believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons. Accordingly, we have insinuated that belief throughout the fabric of our operations in our approach toward our employees. Indeed, the first two core values underlying our commitment to sustainability (see, Update to Corporate Sustainability Report, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab) are “Safety First” – which is a culture that begins with highly-regulated manufacturing plants, continues into the design of science-backed products and extends into market-leading delivery systems – and “Making a Difference” – under which, by rewarding achievement and giving our employees a voice, we attract diverse employees who want to make a difference in their careers, in the company and in the communities that we serve. 
 Our Human Capital program consists of the following elements:
  
• | Board Oversight – through our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“N&CG”), our board of directors oversees human capital-related risks and opportunities. At least annually, the N&CG Committee requires that management update succession planning for key executives, including with respect to planning for the future with a commitment toward diversity, equity and inclusion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategy – the Company’s human capital strategy has two primary elements: giving our employees a voice and providing them with generous benefits (including an unrivalled health benefits plan and awards of common stock to the entire workforce). As we have covered in our Update to Corporate Sustainability Report, our company is a destination for highly qualified employees who are drawn to a workplace where they can make a difference. Our managerial approach is that our functions work in a collaborative manner – cutting across departmental lines to arrive at better solutions with a high level of efficiency. This strategy has enabled the Company to maximize retention, even in an increasingly competitive employment market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Compensation – as mentioned in our Strategy above, compensation is an essential element of our human capital approach. During the pandemic in the midst of the so-called “Great Resignation” that affected many industries, we took measures to incentivize our workforce to remain with us, including across-the-board wage increases in certain of our manufacturing facilities. To the extent that our highly skilled personnel are being recruited by other companies, we endeavor to keep an open conversation on their needs and, where appropriate, have increased their total compensation (through a combination of wage, stock and/or vacation) to retain them.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Voice – our management style is to solicit good ideas from employees, involve them in implementation and give them recognition for ideas that succeed. For example, personnel from virtually any department (be it sales, technology, product development or otherwise) can submit ideas to our Innovation Review Committee (“IRC”) for consideration and potential funding. The IRC continues to be a source of new product ideas that has enabled us to launch several new formulations and other solutions on an annual basis. Similarly, our Beekeeper platform is a company-only social media channel on which employees anywhere in the world can report on their accomplishments, commendations of others and local developments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) – the Company continues to expand its DEI program. In 2021, with the retirement of Lawrence Clark from our board of directors, the Company called upon the Latino Corporate Directors Association to help recruit Marisol Angelini as a new director. With Ms. Angelini’s addition to the board, three of nine members (33%) of our board are female and three of nine (again, 33%) are from underrepresented groups (LGBTQ, Middle Eastern and Latinx). Based upon the Company’s most current EEO-1 (“Equal Employment Opportunity”) Report, representation of African Americans in our domestic workforce exceeds the prevalence of that group in the national population, while representation of Hispanic personnel is slightly below the national average. Nevertheless, during 2022, the Company is working on a plan to advance its commitment to DEI throughout the workforce.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company employed 804 employees as of December 31, 2021, and 771 employees as of December 31, 2020. From time to time, due to the seasonality of its business, AVD uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.

The Company’s Operations in a Pandemic
 Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic early in 2020, the Company has made sustained efforts to ensure the health and safety of the workforce while ensuring continuity of the business, which, under applicable federal guidelines (https://ww.cisa.gov) is part of the nation’s critical infrastructure (as part of the “Food and Agriculture,” “Chemical” and “Public Works and Infrastructure Support Services” sectors). Our network of international subsidiaries is accorded similar status by governments in the territories in which they operate. In the workplace, the Company has designed and implemented protocols for social distancing, made provisions for the workforce to work remotely where possible, and established quarantine policies for those who present COVID-like symptoms or may have been in contact with those who have. Further, the Company keeps current with local, state, federal and international laws and restrictions that could affect the business and provide real-time information to the workforce. The Company has also prepared contingency plans to permit the continued operation of its factories, in the event that there are critical staffing issues due to attrition. Further, the Company continuously monitors supply chain, transport, logistics and border closures and has reached out to third parties to make clear that the Company is continuing to operate, and that it has its own policies relating to health and is committed to compliance with COVID-19 policies of its business partners. 
 As has been the case with many other employers, since the start of 2021, the Company has encouraged its workforce to receive vaccinations against COVID-19 through various means, including incentive programs. The surge of the Delta variant in early 2021 had a comparatively low impact on the Company’s workforce. However, the Omicron variant, which began to spread throughout the world in late 2021, proved to be transmissible to people who were vaccinated or unvaccinated. As a result, like many employers, the Company experienced a surge in COVID-19 infections at the end of the fourth quarter in 2021 carrying over into the first quarter of 2022. Based upon tracking and tracing, we believe that most of these cases came from community (as opposed to workplace) transmission. Further, compared to the Delta surge and earlier variants, these cases typically presented with mild symptoms. All told, the Company has been able to manage its business with minimal impact during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
 7

As of this writing, the Omicron surge is dropping dramatically in many regions, including the U.S. Barring the advent of another variant, between natural immunity from infection and vaccine immunity, populations in many countries will be increasingly less vulnerable to coronavirus. However, the efficacy of boosters, variability in social restrictions and evolution of the virus are not yet known. Consequently, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact that the pandemic may have on its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the near- to mid-term. The Company continues to monitor its business for adverse impacts of the pandemic, including volatility in the foreign exchange markets, demand, supply-chain disruptions in certain markets, and increased costs of employee safety, among others.
