Item 1.    Business
Company Overview
We are one of the world’s leading online marketplaces for connecting design lovers with many of the best sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home décor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We believe we are a leading online marketplace for these luxury design products based on the aggregate number of such listings on our online marketplace and our Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”). Our thoroughly vetted seller base, in-depth editorial content, and custom-built technology platform create trust in our brand and facilitate high-consideration purchases of luxury design products online. By disrupting the way these items are bought and sold, we are both expanding access to, and growing the market for, luxury design products.
1stDibs began in 2000 with the vision of bringing the magic of the Paris flea market online by creating a listings site for top vintage and antique furniture sellers. Soon thereafter, we moved our headquarters to New York City and focused primarily on adding U.S.-based sellers to our site. The quality of our initial seller base enabled us to build a reputation in the design industry as a trusted source for unique luxury design products. Since 2000, we have strengthened our brand and deepened our seller relationships. As of December 31, 2021, we operate an e-commerce marketplace with over 4,700 seller accounts, compared to approximately 4,200 as of December 31, 2020, 4.3 million users compared to 3.5 million as of December 31, 2020, approximately 1.3 million listings, compared to 1.1 million as of December 31, 2020, and a seller stock value in excess of $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. Users represent non-seller visitors who register on our website and include both buyers and prospective buyers. Our seller stock value is the sum of the stock value of all available products listed on our online marketplace. An individual listing’s stock value is calculated as the item’s current price multiplied by its quantity available for sale.
We launched our e-commerce platform in 2013 and transitioned to a full e-commerce marketplace model in 2016. Since then we continue to expand our purchase formats, for example in November 2021, we introduced 1stDibs Auctions, which now allows buyers to bid on their favorite items. We provide our sellers, the vast majority of which are small businesses, access to a global community of buyers and a platform to facilitate e-commerce at scale. Our sellers use our platform to manage their inventory, build their digital marketing presence, and communicate and negotiate orders directly with buyers. We provide our buyers a trusted purchase experience with our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise, our comprehensive buyer protection program. We operate an asset-light business model which allows us to scale in a capital efficient manner. While we facilitate shipping and fulfillment logistics, we do not take physical possession of the items sold on our online marketplace.
The uniqueness, diversity, and high quality of the products on our online marketplace, together with an active marketing effort, have produced a large, global, and growing base of design-loving buyers. Our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise enable a trusted purchase experience. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had approximately 72,000 Active Buyers, compared to 58,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, an average order value (“AOV”) of above $2,700, compared to above $2,500 in the year ended December 31, 2020, and a median order value of $1,300, compared to $1,200 in the year ended December 31, 2020. We define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online marketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the period presented, net of cancellations. The percentage of Active Buyers who make more than one purchase in any given year has been generally consistent from year to year and comprised of 30% and 31% of total Active Buyers in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not focus on AOV as a key metric in evaluating our business or to identify trends, formulate business plans, or make strategic decisions, given our priority to make unique, high-end design items across various price points available through our online marketplace. Highly experienced interior designers, whom we refer to as trade buyers, are frequent, repeat purchasers on our online marketplace and accounted for 29% and 27% of our on-platform GMV in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Through our Trade 1st program, we offer these trade buyers, who comprise a subset of our buyers, additional benefits such as trade-only personalized support, exclusive trade pricing, and buyer incentives. Our Trade 1st program is a buyer-only program and members do not pay any fees to participate in this program.
As our online marketplace has scaled, we have created powerful network effects, with better supply attracting more buyers and more buyers encouraging high-quality sellers to join and remain on our platform. Once in motion, the flywheel effect of this network enhances both seller and buyer quality, which we believe drives a competitive advantage.
We are driving consumer demand for luxury design products online by providing global access to a traditionally fragmented, local, and offline market. As sellers and buyers of luxury design products gain experience transacting online, we believe our combination of technology, service, and brand positions us to enable and grow this market by providing sellers and buyers the tools and access they need.
Our proprietary technology platform enables a purchase funnel that is more robust and interactive than the conventional e-commerce experience. The discovery and transaction process in our industry is more complex than in most e-commerce 
categories. Specifically, transacting in unique luxury design products requires the ability for sellers and buyers to exchange messages, negotiate prices, arrange customized shipping support, and pay swiftly and securely through various payment methods. Our platform turns this complex order flow into an easy-to-use process and converts the valuable data we collect from buyers’ browsing and purchase activity into actionable insights for both sellers and buyers. We empower buyers to engage directly with sellers on our platform throughout all stages of a transaction. Our technology and data represent the cumulative experience of 20 years of business activity, and we believe are extremely difficult to replicate.
We have experienced substantial growth in recent periods. We grew our GMV to $447.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $342.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a growth rate of 31%. We grew our net revenue to $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a growth rate of 25%. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated a net loss of $21.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $(16.5) million, compared to a net loss of $12.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $(6.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Our Market Opportunity
We connect sellers and buyers in what has historically been a fragmented and highly localized global market for unique luxury design products. This market has generally operated offline, functioning mostly through independent galleries, boutiques, and auction houses, thereby restricting a seller’s potential buyer audience and limiting a buyer’s product selection. These offline operations create barriers to both new supply and new demand, limiting the market’s overall growth potential.
We created a single online marketplace that consolidates previously fragmented sellers and buyers on a global scale. We believe our online marketplace, powered by our technology platform, has transformed almost all dimensions of the luxury design buying experience by increasing accessibility and enhancing selection and convenience. By removing geographic barriers and providing inspiration and discovery, we have disrupted this industry and made 1stDibs the go-to online destination for luxury design products.
Global Luxury Market
Our core market, including high-quality design furniture and homewares, fine art, and watches and jewelry, was estimated to be approximately $129 billion in 2020, according to Bain & Company. Our platform is built on a scalable infrastructure that allows us to enter adjacent luxury markets and expand our addressable market with minimal additional investment. The personal luxury goods market, as defined by Bain & Company, excluding watches and jewelry, was estimated to total approximately $210 billion in 2020 and includes adjacent categories, such as footwear, leather goods, apparel, and beauty.
Combining our core market of high-quality design furniture and homewares, fine art, and watches and jewelry with the personal luxury goods market (excluding watches and jewelry), results in an estimated total addressable market size of $339 billion as of 2020.
Expanding the Luxury Goods Market
While the global luxury design market is already large, we believe that as a digital disruptor we have the potential to further expand the overall size of our market. We believe we are growing the market by: (1) increasing the number of digital global luxury design sellers by enabling them to transact on a global online marketplace that materially expands their potential customer base; and (2) growing the luxury design buyer base by introducing our online audience to unique products previously only accessible via in-person galleries, boutiques, and auction houses. Since the launch of our e-commerce platform, we have seen GMV grow to $447.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $342.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a growth rate of 31%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
As we reinvent how buyers discover and engage with luxury design products, we have found that we are attracting a new and broader audience to our market. We have sold items on our online marketplace ranging from less than $100 to $1 million, demonstrating that high-end luxury design products are attainable and within reach of the expanding buyer audience we are attracting to the market.
Increasing Online Penetration
One of the most significant trends driving online penetration in the luxury goods market is an increasingly digitally native customer base. Bain & Company estimates that online personal luxury goods purchases will continue to grow, reaching up to 30% of total sales by 2025. According to Bain & Company, Gen-Y and Gen-Z, born during 1981-1995 and 1996-2015, respectively, are expected to collectively account for over 65% of purchases in the luxury goods market by 2025. These generations are leading the shift from offline to online commerce and will soon dominate the luxury goods market’s customer base.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online sales in the personal luxury goods market, we believe the driving forces behind this shift were well underway before the COVID-19 pandemic and are expected to remain. Although we believe our business has been positively impacted to some extent by these trends, we cannot predict whether these trends will continue to impact online sales growth generally, or the growth of our business, at the same rate in the future as the pandemic evolves.
The 1stDibs Marketplace
Trust
Trust is at the core of the online marketplace that we have built in over two decades of operating history. Trust in our online marketplace is critical to facilitating online transactions of highly considered purchases with high price points. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, over 20% of our on-platform GMV was generated from orders with an item value above $15,000 and approximately 3% for orders with an item value of $100,000 or more. Our thorough seller vetting process inspires buyer confidence in our sellers and in the quality of the luxury design products sold on 1stDibs. Extensive fraud protection and secure payment solutions further establish the trust sellers and buyers have in our online marketplace. The ability for buyers to interact and negotiate prices directly with sellers increases both on-platform conversion and buyer retention rate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we retained 39% of the 2020 on-platform GMV from buyers acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we retained 36% of the 2019 on-platform GMV from buyers acquired in 2019. We categorize buyers into cohorts based on the date of their first purchase on the 1stDibs platform. GMV attributed to a buyer cohort represents the total dollar value from items purchased by that buyer cohort in a given period, minus cancellations within that period and excluding shipping and sales taxes. To calculate the percentage of buyers retained, we divide total GMV in a specific period for a given cohort by the GMV of that cohort in the prior period. This buyer retention rate and our AOV of above $2,700 for the year ended December 31, 2021 are evidence of the trust in our online marketplace. Our 1stDibs Promise gives our buyers peace of mind with every purchase by providing the following features and commitments:
•A community of thoroughly vetted sellers from around the world to ensure high-quality products;
•Confidence at checkout with multiple secure payment options and a comprehensive fraud protection and prevention program;
•Customer service support from dedicated specialists to answer questions, assist with orders, and stand ready to resolve any transaction or technical issues throughout the buying process;
•Worry-free cancellations within 24 hours;
•The ability to work with both parties in the unlikely event a buyer receives an item that is different than described or has been damaged in transit to resolve the issue;
•A price-match guarantee to ensure that if a buyer finds a 1stDibs seller that has the same item for a lower price elsewhere, 1stDibs will match it; and
•Facilitation of a seamless, transparent, and insured global end-to-end logistics and delivery experience focused on security and a high level of care. 
Value Proposition to Sellers
•Demand Generation: As of December 31, 2021, we provided sellers access to a global base of 4.3 million users in over 100 countries, who would otherwise largely be inaccessible in an offline market. We built 1stDibs to empower and inspire confidence in our sellers by using our proprietary technology to digitize and transform their businesses. We believe that creating a digital presence and enabling access to buyers across the globe allows us to expand the addressable market for luxury sellers. 
•Operational Efficiency: Our sellers can efficiently scale their businesses without the friction associated with in-person sales and multiple third-party platforms. The ability to offer a convenient, seamless transaction experience, including on-platform communications and a wide range of payment solutions, further drives buyer conversion. Sellers can add new products to our online marketplace whenever they choose, essentially creating a storefront that remains open 24/7. Making sellers’ inventory available online to a global audience allows them to reach new buyers and drive increased sales without increasing their physical footprint. We maximize search engine optimization to help buyers find items and connect with our sellers, allowing them to purchase products tailored to their tastes and preferences with ease. Access to a dedicated app enables our sellers to communicate with buyers and complete these transactions from around the world. We have assembled a robust network of logistics providers to help sellers fulfill orders at a lower cost, giving them an advantage relative to conventional offline sales and allowing them to focus more time on what they do best: curating and selling unique luxury design items.
•Creation of Seller Identity: Sellers can establish an online presence and identity on our online marketplace. They have autonomy to publish item descriptions and pictures, curate their storefront and biographies, and communicate and negotiate directly with buyers. Expanding a seller’s ability to share its story across various forms of media, including text, photographs, and videos, significantly increases buyer engagement and conversion. Once sellers are added to our online catalogue, we help build sellers’ brands through editorial and social placements, including our online magazines Introspective and The Study, which offer sellers additional avenues through which to advertise online.
•Data Analytics: Our platform provides us with rich data throughout the entire user journey. This data allows sellers to offer more relevant products and optimize their pricing strategies, which enables them to efficiently scale their businesses. We provide sellers with a comprehensive suite of seller tools, education, and analytics with no additional charge, including reporting, tracking, and inside perspectives on pricing based on the historical sales of similar items. Sellers also benefit from our proprietary algorithms and targeting technologies to connect with both consumers and trade buyers.
Value Proposition to Buyers
•Curated Assortment: We are a highly sought after destination for unique, high-quality luxury design products. Thoroughly vetting all sellers on our online marketplace supports our buyers’ desire for quality and curation, thereby reducing their search time and purchase risk. We provide buyers with design inspiration through our expertly merchandised collections and our online editorial publications Introspective and The Study.
•Control: Unlike conventional offline alternatives, we offer our buyers convenient 24/7 access to approximately 1.3 million luxury design products. We remove complexity and introduce transparency to the purchasing process. We allow buyers to transact securely from their homes, bypassing the complicated and time-intensive process and often opaque pricing associated with traditional offline channels. Our valuable buyer base also appreciates the privacy and anonymity associated with purchasing products online through our marketplace.
•Quality of Experience: Our messaging service allows buyers to communicate directly with sellers, receive quick responses, and negotiate prices. Multiple possible payment methods offer our buyers a convenient checkout experience compared to traditional offline retail channels. Our Price-Match Guarantee further increases purchasing confidence, as buyers are assured they will always transact at the lowest price. Trade buyers further benefit from tailored programs such as trade exclusive pricing and buyer incentives through our Trade 1st program. Our customer experience associates help ensure the satisfaction of sellers and buyers by addressing and assisting in the resolution of questions relating to orders, deliveries, returns, and disputes.
•Personalization: We collect rich data around our buyers’ browsing patterns and purchase behaviors. We use this data to personalize our marketing efforts and listing suggestions. As a result, we are able to curate our buyers’ feeds to target their specific tastes and preferences. This personalization improves user engagement. We provide high-touch human support for consumer and trade buyers through our customized private client and trade service teams, which further enhances the buying process.
Our Competitive Strengths
Largest Selection of Unique Luxury Design Products
We offer the largest online selection of luxury design products from leading sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home décor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We believe our growing collection of over one million luxury design products is unmatched and makes us the premier destination for design lovers and enthusiasts. Luxury and antique design products tend to retain value over time as a result of their scarcity and durability. We aggregate supply from a large number of globally distributed sellers, offering buyers a destination to access a variety of luxury design products across multiple verticals online. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had approximately 40% and 39% of our listings located outside the United States, respectively. The percentage of our seller accounts based outside of the United States was 47% and 45% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
Brand History Built on Trust and Authenticity
We have built a brand that is native to the Internet and synonymous with luxury design. Our brand is extensible across verticals and geographies, based upon our long-standing relationships with leading sellers of luxury design products and the trust we have established with buyers, creating a significant barrier to entry. Our high-quality editorial content shows the depth of our domain expertise, giving us credibility with sellers, building buyer trust and loyalty in our brand and online marketplace. This trust is built through a seamless buying and selling experience, backed by years of excellence and an industry-leading vetting process.
Our vetting specialists complete a comprehensive evaluation of each seller prior to such seller listing products in the marketplace. These specialists are highly trained, experienced design experts and conduct extensive due diligence on each seller. This vetting process is highly scalable, and helps to ensure that our buyers can continue to purchase items on our online marketplace with confidence, as we grow.
Highly Engaged Buyer Community
Our online marketplace appeals to a broad range of design lovers across multiple income groups, geographies, and age groups. Our buyers appreciate the value of high-quality luxury products and want a convenient and secure way to complete these highly considered product purchases. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Active Buyers had 80 sessions and viewed 237 product pages, on average. Our editorial content, combined with our expert curation and merchandising, helps buyers navigate through over one million luxury design products. Personalized recommendations further tailor this discovery process.
Seamless Purchasing Experience
We deliver a seamless luxury experience in a digital environment. We pioneered a two-sided communication functionality that allows sellers and buyers to negotiate directly through our platform’s message center. Our buyers also have access to a dedicated sales and customer experience teams to ensure a smooth, convenient, and personalized buying experience. As ambassadors of 1stDibs, our sales team interacts with high potential trade accounts and private clients to identify sales opportunities and to educate them on our service offerings. Buyers enjoy the flexibility of accessing our platform across devices and choosing among a wide range of payment options and purchase formats, such as Auction, Private Offer or Negotiation. Additionally, we have assembled a global network of logistics providers to allow our sellers to seamlessly ship products virtually anywhere in the world and provide a positive order fulfillment experience for buyers.
Powerful Network Effects
We created powerful network effects by leveraging our proprietary data and technology, with better supply attracting more buyers and more buyers encouraging high-quality sellers to join and remain on our online marketplace. Once in motion, the flywheel of this network enhances both seller and buyer quality and drives a competitive advantage. Having more buyers on our marketplace increases the sale potential for our luxury design sellers, causing them to list more inventory and focus more time on 1stDibs buyers. This value cycle serves as a barrier to entry against potential competition. This network effect has driven tremendous value to all parties and made 1stDibs one of the largest luxury design online marketplaces in the world with increasing returns to scale.
Fully Scalable Marketplace Model
We are the only online marketplace operating a scaled, asset-light business that offers a curated selection of luxury design products across our specific verticals. We do not own or manage inventory or directly manage fulfillment and shipping, further supporting favorable working capital dynamics as we grow. Our scalable technology platform enables us to efficiently drive expansion into new geographies and verticals while supporting the creation and development of new applications. For example in November 2021, we introduced 1stDibs Auctions as a new purchase format.
Powerful Data and Analytics
We use proprietary data and algorithms to drive operational insights that continuously enhance our seller and buyer experiences. We leverage this data, including user behaviors, sales trends, and seller behaviors, to improve the effectiveness of our buyer targeting and conversion efforts, and increase supply growth from existing and prospective sellers. As our online marketplace grows, our data becomes increasingly valuable. This data advantage allows us to develop business processes to optimize our operations, including marketplace supply, merchandising, authentication, pricing, marketing, and servicing. We collect and share data from across the platform to improve seller tactics and help them make informed decisions about sourcing, pricing, and selling products on our online marketplace. We use internal and external data to target, acquire, and retain qualified buyers through performance-based, data-driven marketing campaigns.
Innovative and Proprietary Technology
Our highly sophisticated, purpose-built technology stack facilitates complex, multi-step online transactions and is extremely difficult to replicate. We created an extensive digital catalog in luxury design with associated metadata that is used to simplify buyer experience in an ordinarily complex purchase process. Technology powers all aspects of our business, including our complex single-SKU and multi-SKU inventory management system. We intend to continue to leverage automation and tools to improve efficiency and deliver a positive customer experience. A majority of 1stDibs buyers access our online marketplace via a mobile device, which offers a much broader set of buyer data than can be realized through the website. We believe this data advantage will continue to grow as the growth of app and mobile web usage outpaces the growth of usage of the website itself.
Our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Efforts
We are a mission-driven company. As such, our business creates a positive environmental and economic impact, balancing the needs of our buyers, sellers, partners, employees, investors and the environment. We are committed to extending the lifecycle of luxury goods by promoting their recirculation. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 70% of the listings on our marketplace are secondary. Buying an item on our marketplace offsets the need to manufacture a new item, this opportunity to shop sustainably creates a positive economic impact for all parties. 
We have built a talented, experienced management team led by our CEO, David Rosenblatt, who joined 1stDibs in November 2011 with a vision to transform the online luxury experience. Members of our management team have helped create and grow leading luxury, design, and technology businesses globally such as Amazon, DoubleClick, eBay, Farfetch, PayPal, and Twitter, and have retained a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a wide array of knowledge. We believe in the importance of fostering a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, diversity is both a priority and strength of our company. We are proud to have a diverse team, and strive to continue to improve representation throughout the organization. Below is a breakdown of how our U.S.-based team self-identifies as of December 31, 2021. 

 | Asian | Black or African American | Hispanic or Latino | White | Two or more races | Female
All Employees | 18 | % | 7 | % | 7 | % | 65 | % | 3 | % | 57 | %
Management | 22 | % | 11 | % | — | % | 67 | % | — | % | 67 | %

The composition of our Board of Directors also reflects our commitment to diversity. Three of our six directors, including each chairperson of our Audit, Compensation, and Nomination and Corporate Governance committees, are female or a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
We are committed to building a diverse team and an inclusive workplace that respects and meets the needs of our diverse community of sellers, creators, and customers. To that end, we are leading a number of initiatives to further broaden the spectrum of our workforce and to create a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our goal is to ensure that all people feel welcome and are ultimately celebrated for their uniqueness.
Our efforts are focused on establishing business norms that promote equity, diversity and inclusion both within the company and across the broader design community. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our internal approach included a partnership with a leading Black-owned management consulting firm to drive advancement of our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) strategy through assessing and improving our people practices and educating team members on core DEI concepts. Externally, we provided financial support to over 35 organizations through our employee giving and charitable donations program. 
Our Growth Strategies
Expand Our Buyer Base
We are focused on continuing to grow our buyer base and believe we are still in the early stages of introducing a unique and growing supply of luxury design products to a much broader audience. Of our 4.3 million users as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that approximately 69% are U.S.-based and 31% are international, which represents less than 1% penetration of the population of both markets. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that approximately 70% were U.S.-based and 30% were international. Users represent non-seller visitors who register on our website and are identified by a unique email address, and include both buyers and prospective buyers. As of December 31, 2021, 18% of buyers are located internationally compared to 19% as of December 31, 2020. We have primarily grown our current buyer base organically through word-of-mouth, mentions in the press, and earned media. In addition to continued organic growth, we believe we can significantly increase our buyer base by utilizing targeted, data-driven marketing efforts that generate meaningful returns. We believe we can continue to expand our buyer audience across a wide swath of buyer demographics including income, geography, and age, as well as level of design experience and design preference.
Grow Our Marketplace Supply
We intend to further increase the supply on our online marketplace while maintaining our thorough seller vetting process, by offering a captivating value proposition and enhanced item listing tools, adding new inventory from existing sellers, and growing the range of sellers from whom we source.
We continue to enhance our value proposition for sellers. We provide broad and growing access to a global base of design-minded buyers and a platform with a comprehensive suite of tools that help our sellers successfully transact and scale their business. This value proposition drives sellers to our online marketplace, deepens the breadth of our inventory, and helps attract new buyers.
As of December 31, 2021, the number of seller accounts grew to over 4,700 from approximately 4,200 as of December 31, 2020, and our seller stock value was in excess of $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this shift, we believe the driving forces were underway before the COVID-19 pandemic, as sellers and buyers recognize the benefits of transacting online. Although we believe our business has been positively impacted to some extent by these trends, we cannot predict whether these trends will continue to impact online sales growth generally, or the growth of our business, at the same rate in the future as the pandemic evolves, including if and when the pandemic begins to subside.
We may also choose to expand our network of sellers inorganically, either through acquisitions of, or partnerships with, companies or design brands, notably within localized non-English speaking markets.
Pursue New Product Verticals and Diversification Opportunities
We have demonstrated our ability to successfully grow and diversify beyond our original offering of vintage furniture, as exemplified by our proven track record of expanding both across verticals, such as art, jewelry, and fashion, and within verticals, such as the expansion from vintage and antique furniture to include new and custom furniture. Adding verticals has several benefits, including increasing our addressable market, the number of sellers and buyers, and purchasing frequency, and offering our buyers a wider supply of inventory while strengthening our brand as a preeminent online destination for luxury design products. We believe there are also opportunities to diversify our business model by expanding into additional sales formats, including, for example, an auction format which launched in November 2021 and has traditionally been the primary sales format in our industry. We intend to continue to evaluate such diversification opportunities as part of our overall growth strategy. Our platform infrastructure is designed to scale with growth and diversification in mind.
Expand Marketing Efforts and Drive Brand Awareness
We believe that the growth of our online marketplace is a testament to our compelling value proposition for 1stDibs sellers and buyers. Our sellers and buyers are our best marketers, sharing their positive experiences directly with others. We deploy the majority of our marketing budget on performance-based, data-driven marketing campaigns to attract users and cost-effectively convert them to buyers and to retain buyers.
We also believe we have a significant opportunity to increase awareness of our brand and attract a much larger audience of buyers. We intend to broaden our marketing efforts to include additional marketing channels, including television, radio, podcasts, and online display advertising, where we believe a large opportunity currently exists to not only drive increased visibility but also deepen our connection with both existing sellers and buyers.
Expand Internationally
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the vast majority of our buyers were located in the United States and other English-speaking countries. As of December 31, 2021, 40% of the supply on our online marketplace comes from outside the United States, while only 18% of buyers are located internationally. We believe that this presents a large international expansion opportunity, particularly within France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and China, where we have existing demand. Our website traffic also indicates strong international presence and opportunities for conversion, with approximately 34% of current traffic coming from outside the United States. Furthermore, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. on-platform GMV as a percentage of total on-platform GMV was 19% and 22%, respectively, with limited investment indicating that we have the opportunity to capture additional international demand.
In continuing to expand internationally, we plan to focus initially on organic search and later on performance-driven paid marketing and email campaigns. We may also expand internationally through acquisitions.
1stDibs Marketplace
Our online marketplace connects a global network of sellers and buyers through a scalable, e-commerce platform. Sellers utilizing our online marketplace have significantly greater access to buyers, particularly highly engaged buyers, compared to alternative online and offline channels. Sellers can establish their presence and identity on our online marketplace, publish item descriptions and photos, curate storefronts, and communicate directly with buyers. With our platform, sellers have the flexibility to sell their products in various formats, the ability to control pricing, and access to our full suite of seller tools, analytics and education, free of additional charge, including reports, tracking, and inside perspective on pricing. In addition, our online marketplace provides access to a robust network of logistics providers to help sellers fulfill orders efficiently. These tools allow them to become more effective, targeted sellers.
Through our online marketplace, buyers have access to a curated supply of luxury design products from thoroughly vetted sellers. Our messenger service allows buyers to communicate directly with sellers and negotiate on the marketplace. Buyers can purchase products through multiple secure payment options, with the benefit of comprehensive fraud protection and prevention programs and resolution assistance in the event a buyer receives an item that is different from what was described or is damaged in transit. We offer interior designers, whom we also refer to as “trade buyers,” additional benefits such as trade-only 
personalized support, exclusive trade pricing, and buyer incentives through our Trade 1st program, and editorial coverage. Whether the buyer is an individual consumer or trade buyer, we provide support at the individual level through our Private Client and trade services to provide a seamless buying process.
The 1stDibs marketplace focuses on delivering high-quality seller and buyer experiences:
