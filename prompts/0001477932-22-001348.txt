Item 1: Description of Business
General Overview

Kange Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company,” “Kange,” “we,” and “us”), is an early-stage company that was incorporated in Nevada on August 16, 2013.

The Company has historically focused on developing and marketing software product as mobile applications for end users of iPhone and iPad from Apple, Inc., and mobile phones using the Android platform. Since 2017, the Company has been focusing on the intersection of technology and wholistic technology-based health treatments, with the intention to provide services to formulate a treatment model to meet the needs of professional athletes that suffer from PTSD and the early onset of dementia and Alzheimer’s. The Company is currently evaluating operations in the wholistic health industry.

On November 9, 2015, AMJ Global, LLC (“AMJ Global”), a company beneficially owned by Dr. Arthur Malone, Jr., the Company’s chief executive officer and director, assigned the rights of AMJ Global pursuant to its agreements with Blabeey, Inc. (“Blabeey”), a mobile App designer. The irrevocable assignment, transferred and conveyed in its entirety to the Company in a common control transaction, all of AMJ Global’s rights and obligations that are stipulated and set forth in every and all agreements between AMJ Global and Blabeey, including, but not limited to, the agreement between AMJ Global and Blabeey dated October 26, 2015. Blabeey’s web site is www.blabeey.com, which is not incorporated in this filing. The Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock to AMJ Global for the assignment. The Company valued those shares at $471,672, the historical asset costs of Blabeey. Since the Company’s transaction with AMJ Global was between entities under common control, the amount of the historical cost of the assets, $471,672, was recorded as an expense in 2015 as there was no fixed and determinable future value, and the expense was recorded as a loss on the acquisition of contractual rights. Subsequently, the Company began working with Blabeey on developing technology for social media regarding Autism, PTSD and other neurological issues, and the Company is still consulting with Blabeey regarding software development opportunities in connection with the wholistic health industry.

In May of 2017, the Company retained Bruce Weitzberg to serve on the Company’s Board of Advisors and advise the Company regarding the intersection of technology and wholistic health care treatment and healthy living. Mr. Weitzberg is the CEO of Patient Access Solutions Inc., a Nevada corporation with ticker symbol “PASO” (“PASO”). PASO is a provider of healthcare and financial processing solutions for the healthcare and dental industries, and it has also opened a new center for the treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and other biomedical conditions.

Subsequently, the Company retained James Lantiegne, a professional magician and former COO and CFO of a national software company, to serve on the Company’s Board of Advisors and provide the Company advice on the intersection of technology and health. In October of 2017, the Company retained Benny Malone, former NFL running back for the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins, and Eric Metcalf, former NFL running back, wide receiver and three-time Pro-Bowl selection, to serve on the Company’s Board of Advisors and advise the Company regarding sports health issues and treatments.
