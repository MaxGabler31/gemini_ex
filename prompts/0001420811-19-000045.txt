Item 1. | Business

 Our Company
On Deck Capital, Inc. is the proven leader in transparent and responsible online lending to small business. We were founded in 2006 and pioneered the use of data analytics and digital technology to make real-time lending decisions and deliver capital rapidly to small businesses online. Our mission is to help small businesses succeed. Today, we offer a wide range of term loans and lines of credit customized for the needs of small business owners. We also offer bank clients a comprehensive technology and services platform to help them digitize their small business lending process through ODX, a wholly-owned subsidiary. In December 2018, we announced our intention to enter the equipment finance market. OnDeck has provided over $10 billion in loans to customers in 700 different industries across the United States, Canada and Australia. We have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and are rated 5 stars by Trustpilot.
We are a leading platform for online small business lending and continue to transform small business lending by making it efficient and convenient for small businesses to access working capital through innovative lending experiences and financial products. Our platform touches every aspect of the customer life cycle, including customer acquisition, sales, scoring and underwriting, funding, and servicing and collections. Enabled by our proprietary technology and analytics, we aggregate and analyze thousands of data points from dynamic, disparate data sources, and the relationships among those attributes, to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses rapidly and accurately. The data points include customer activity shown on their bank statements, business and personal credit bureau reports, government filings, tax and census data. Small businesses can apply for a term loan or line of credit, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on our website in minutes and, using our proprietary OnDeck Score®, we can make a funding decision immediately and fund as fast as 24 hours. 
We also offer bank clients a comprehensive technology and services platform that facilitates online lending to small business customers through our subsidiary, ODX. In 2018, we established ODX in response to the growing demand from banks for third-party digital origination solutions. ODX will strive to provide bank and financial institution clients a best-in-class solution package consisting of platform-as-a-service technology modules, consultative analytics and business process services, and real-time origination services support to enable digital small business origination solutions. Over time, we believe ODX can become a significant contributor to OnDeck’s financial growth and profitability, especially given ODX’s wide range of potential bank and non-bank partners. However, we do not expect ODX to be profitable in the coming year as our near-term focus is on expanding our capabilities and scaling the business. 
Since we made our first loan in 2007, we have originated more than $10 billion of loans and as of December 31, 2018, our total assets were $1.2 billion and our loans held for investment, net, was $1.0 billion.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we originated $2.5 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion of loans, respectively. Our originations have been supported by a diverse and scalable set of funding sources, including committed debt facilities, securitization facilities and, prior to 2018, OnDeck Marketplace, our whole loan sale platform for institutional investors. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gross revenue of $398.4 million, $351.0 million and $291.3 million, respectively. In 2018, we generated $27.7 million of net income attributable to On Deck Capital, Inc common stockholders compared to net losses of $11.5 million and $83.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $45.4 million, $4.2 million and $(67.0) million over the same three-year period. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion and reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss). 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 4, 2006. We operate from our headquarters in New York, New York and also have offices in Arlington, Virginia, Denver, Colorado, Sydney, Australia and Toronto, Canada.

Our Market and Solution
The small business lending market is vast and underserved. OnDeck’s vision is to be the first-choice lending partner for underserved small businesses. According to the FDIC, there were $219 billion in outstanding business loans in the U.S. with balances of $250,000 or below at June 30, 2018 across 24.3 million loans.
We offer a suite of financing options, currently through term loans and lines of credit, tailored to meet the needs of small businesses throughout their life cycle. Since we made our first loan in 2007, we have originated more than $10 billion of loans across more than 700 industries in all 50 states, as well as Canada and Australia. The top five states in which we, or our issuing bank partner, originated loans in 2018 were California, Florida, Texas, New York and New Jersey, representing approximately 15%, 9%, 9%, 7% and 4% of our total loan originations, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our customers had a median annual revenue of approximately $681,005, with 90% of our customers having between $148,699 and $4.2 million in annual revenue, and have been in business for a median of 9 years, with 90% in business between 2 and 28 years. During 2018, the average size of a term loan we made was $55,490 and the average size of a line of credit extended to our customers was $33,689.
We believe our scale offers significant benefits, including lower customer acquisition costs, access to a broader dataset, better underwriting decisions and a lower cost of capital, compared to certain smaller online lending businesses.
We believe our customers choose us because we provide the following key benefits sought by small business borrowers:

• | Tailored Solutions. We offer small businesses a suite of financing choices with our term loans and lines of credit that we believe can be tailored to effectively address small businesses' particular funding needs. We believe that small businesses prefer to work with providers with whom they can build long-term relationships and that the range of our offerings makes us an ideal lending partner. Our term loans are available from $5,000 up to $500,000 with maturities of three to 36 months and our lines of credit range from $6,000 to $100,000 and are repayable within six or twelve months of the date of most recent draw. We believe this provides a wider range of term lengths, pricing alternatives and repayment options than any other online small business lender. We also report customer performance to several business credit bureaus, which can help small businesses build their business credit.


• | Simple. Small businesses can submit an application on our website in as little as minutes. We are able to provide many loan applicants with an immediate decision and, if approved, fund as fast as 24 hours. Because we require no in-person meetings, collect comprehensive information electronically and have an intuitive online application form, we have been able to significantly increase the convenience and efficiency of the application process without burdensome documentation requirements.


• | Human. Being “human” is about understanding our customers and treating them with respect. We employ a hybrid approach to deliver a "human" experience, where people and technology complement one another. Our internal sales force and customer service representatives provide assistance throughout the application process and the life of the loan. Our U.S-based representatives support customers in the U.S., and currently also Canada, and our separate Sydney-based representatives support customers in Australia. Our representatives are available Monday through Saturday before, during and after regular business hours to accommodate the busy schedules of small business owners. Our website enables our customers to complete the loan application process online, but they may also elect to mail, fax or securely email us their application and related documentation. We believe that our inclusion of the human element differentiates us from many digital lenders that attempt to complete transactions with no human interaction as well as from banks that, we believe, have a poor history of customer service and satisfaction. 

Our Loan Distribution Channels
We source our lending customers through three diverse distribution channels: Direct Marketing, Strategic Partners and Funding Advisors.

• | Through our direct marketing channel, we make contact with prospective customers utilizing direct mail, outbound calling, social media and other online marketing.


• | In our strategic partner channel we enter into agreements with third parties that serve or otherwise have access to the small business community, who then introduce us to prospective customers. Strategic partners include, among others, small business-focused service providers, other financial institutions, financial and accounting solution providers, payment processors, independent sales organizations and other websites. Strategic partners conduct their own marketing activities which may include email marketing, leveraging existing business relationships and direct mail. Our business development team is dedicated to expanding our network of strategic partners and leveraging their relationships with small businesses to acquire new customers. In general, if a strategic partner refers a customer that takes a loan from us, we pay that strategic partner a referral fee based on the amount of the originated loan. Strategic partners differ from funding advisors (described below) in that strategic partners generally provide a referral to our direct sales team and our 

4

direct sales team is the main point of contact with the customer. On the other hand, funding advisors serve as the main points of contact with the customer on its initial loan and may help a customer access multiple funding options besides those we offer. As a result, funding advisors' commissions generally exceed strategic partners' referral fees. We generally do not recover these commissions or fees upon default of a loan. Generally, no other fees are paid to strategic partners.

• | Through our funding advisor program, we make contact with prospective customers by entering into relationships with third party independent advisors, known as funding advisor program partners, or FAPs, that typically offer a variety of financial services to small businesses. FAPs conduct their own marketing activities, which may include direct mail, online marketing, paid leads, television and radio advertising or leveraging existing business relationships. FAPs include independent sales organizations, commercial loan brokers and equipment leasing firms. FAPs act as intermediaries between potential customers and lenders by brokering business loans on behalf of potential customers. As part of our FAP strategy, we require a detailed certification process, including background checks, to approve a FAP, and annual recertifications in order to remain a FAP. We also employ a senior compliance officer whose responsibilities include overseeing compliance matters involving our funding advisor program channel. Our relationships with FAPs provide for the payment of a commission at the time the term loan is originated or line of credit account is opened. We generally do not recover these commissions upon default of a loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had active relationships with more than 400 FAPs, and in 2018, 2017 and 2016, no single FAP was associated with more than 2.0%, 1.7%, and 2.1% of our total originations, respectively. 

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us and serve as barriers for others seeking to enter our market:


• | Singular Focus and Visibility. We are passionate about small businesses. Since we began lending in 2007, we have focused exclusively on assessing and delivering credit to small businesses. We believe this passion, focus and small business credit expertise provides us with significant competitive advantages, including deep insight into small businesses and their financing needs. Our partnerships with well-known companies such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, or JPM, PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, Intuit Inc., and others also help increase our visibility and validate our brand. 


• | Significant Scale. We have originated over $10 billion in loans across more than 700 industries since we made our first loan in 2007. We believe our extensive experience and significant scale allow us to obtain and analyze large and growing amounts of data, which provides us with greater insight to identify, understand and meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers as well as better manage our business. For business reasons and because of our scale we were able to become an NYSE listed company, which requires us to meet high standards of transparency, governance, financial reporting and other legal requirements. We believe this differentiates us from non-listed small business lenders. 


• | Diversified Distribution Channels. We have established distribution capabilities through diversified channels, including direct marketing, strategic partnerships and funding advisors. Having multiple distribution channels enables us to optimize our targeting efforts and resource allocation in response to fluctuations in customer demand and marketing costs and the overall competitive landscape by channel. Moreover, each channel provides its own set of complimentary benefits. Our direct marketing includes direct mail, outbound calling, social media and other online marketing, enhances brand awareness and fosters customer retention and loyalty. Our strategic partners, including small business-focused service providers, payment processors, and other financial institutions, offer us access to their base of small business customers and data that can be used to enhance our targeting capabilities. Our relationships with a large network of funding advisors, including businesses that provide loan brokerage services, expand our reach in identifying and serving more customers and aid brand awareness.


• | Proprietary Small Business Credit Evaluation. We use data, analytics and technology to optimize our business operations and the customer experience. Our loan decision process, including our proprietary OnDeck Score, provide us with significant visibility and predictability to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses and allow us to better serve more customers across more industries. With each loan application, each originated loan and each payment received, our dataset expands and our loan decision process improves. We are able to lend to more small businesses than if we relied on personal credit scores alone. We are also able to use our proprietary data and analytics engine to pre-qualify customers and market to those customers we believe are predisposed to take a loan and have a higher likelihood of approval. When we believe it is warranted, we may also utilize our hybrid approach which utilizes our online platform together with our judgmental underwriting to help tailor the right financial solution for our customers. We believe that our technology and decisioning process allow us to more quickly and dynamically make credit adjustments in changing environments compared to certain smaller or less experienced lenders.

• | End-to-End Integrated Technology Platform. We built our integrated platform specifically to meet the financing needs of small businesses. Our platform touches every aspect of the customer life cycle, including customer acquisition, sales, scoring and underwriting, funding, and servicing and collections. This purpose-built infrastructure is enhanced by robust fraud protection, multiple layers of security and proprietary application programming interfaces. It enables us to deliver a superior customer experience and facilitates agile decision making.


• | High Customer Satisfaction and Repeat Customer Base. Our strong value proposition has been validated by our customers. We achieved an overall Net Promoter Score of 81 for the year ended December 31, 2018 based on our internal survey of U.S. customers in all three of our distribution channels. The Net Promoter Score is a widely used index ranging from negative 100 to positive 100 that measures customer loyalty. Our score places us at the upper end of customer satisfaction ratings and compares favorably to the average Net Promoter Score of 35 for the financial services industry. We have also consistently achieved an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. We believe that high customer satisfaction has played an important role in repeat borrowing by our customers. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, 52%, 52% and 53%, respectively, of loan originations were by repeat term loan customers, who either replaced their existing term loan with a new, usually larger, term loan or took out a new term loan after paying off their existing OnDeck term loan in full. Repeat customers generally demonstrate improvements in key metrics such as revenue and bank balance when they return for an additional loan. Approximately 29% percent of our origination volume from repeat customers in 2018 was due to unpaid principal balances rolled from existing loans directly into new loans. Generally each repeat customer seeking another term loan must meet the following standards:


• | the business must be approximately 50% paid down on its existing loan;


• | the business must be current on its outstanding OnDeck loan with no material delinquency history; and


• | the business must be fully re-underwritten and determined to be of adequate credit quality.


• | Differentiated Funding Platform. We source funding principally through debt facilities and securitizations with a diverse group of banks, insurance companies and other institutional lenders. This diversity provides us with a mix of scalable funding sources, significant capital commitments and access to flexible funding for growth. In addition, because we contribute a portion of the capital for each loan we fund via our debt facilities and securitizations, we are able to align interests with our lenders. 


• | Durable Business Model. Since we began lending in 2007, we have successfully operated our business through both strong and weak economic environments. The diversity of our portfolio including loans to over 97,000 small businesses in over 700 industries results in minimal portfolio concentrations and reduces sensitivity to industry specific downturns or events. Our real-time data, short duration loans, automated daily and weekly collections, risk management capabilities and unit economics enable us to react rapidly to changing market conditions.

Our Strategy for Responsible Growth and Improved Profitability 
Our vision is to become the first choice lender to underserved small businesses while growing responsibly and increasing profitability. In doing so, and to accomplish this, we intend to:

• | Expand in Each of our Distribution Channels and Optimize our Funnel. We plan continued efficient investment in direct marketing to increase our brand awareness and add new customers. As our dataset expands, we will continue to pre-qualify and market to those customers we believe are predisposed to take a loan and have a higher likelihood of approval. We have seen success from this strategy as the direct marketing channel continued to originate more dollar volume than any other channel in 2018. We also intend to grow originations by broadening our indirect distribution capabilities through expanding our strategic partner and funding advisor networks. Our strategic partner channel offers our lowest customer acquisition cost while enhancements to our funding advisor network has led to increased application volume and conversion rates. We regularly seek to improve our efficiency in attracting new and repeat customers to apply for loans from us, to increase the number of completed loan applications and improve the conversion rate of completed applications into funded loans for qualified small businesses. This includes many aspects of our business from marketing, sales and customer support, underwriting, funding and servicing. By optimizing our sales funnel, we seek to reduce customer acquisition costs, responsibly increase loan originations and improve profitability.


• | Continue to Optimize Decisioning Models. We continually update our decisioning models based on additional data and use that information to refine and optimize our marketing and lending decisions. For example, during 2018 as in prior years, in the ordinary course of business, we conducted numerous underwriting tests of discreet pools of loans with defined characteristics to assess the profitability of the sample. Testing included specific sectors, credit profiles and loan terms. We incorporate the learnings from these tests, both positive and negative, into our underwriting which we believe will lead to increased originations and profitability. 

6


• | Expand Loan Offerings and Features. We will continue to develop financing solutions and enhancements for underserved small businesses throughout their life cycle. We offer lines of credit with limits up to $100,000 and term loans up to $500,000 with terms up to 36-months. In 2018, we launched a line of credit instant funding option to small businesses via their debit cards through our agreements with Ingo Money and Visa and announced our intention to enter into the equipment finance market. We regularly evaluate and explore new ideas including variations of existing loans through test pilot programs before new loans or loan enhancements are fully introduced. We believe expanded offerings and features will help retain existing customers, attract new customers and ultimately increase customer lifetime value.


• | Grow International Businesses. We continue to grow our business in both Canada and Australia where we believe the markets for online small business loans are still relatively new and underserved. This growth includes our recently announced intention to combine our Canadian business with Evolocity Financial Group, or Evolocity, a private, Montréal-based online small business lender. As we grow our international business, we will closely monitor and adjust our pricing and costs, including the costs of integrating businesses with Evolocity. We believe there are other promising international markets, although our near-term plans do not include expansion of OnDeck lending into additional countries.


• | Grow ODX. We believe the opportunity exists to further expand ODX, which offers bank clients a comprehensive technology and services platform to facilitate online lending to their small business customers. We have existing agreements with JPM and PNC, each of which uses ODX services to support the origination and underwriting processes for a portion of their small business customers. We intend to work with our existing bank clients to increase the volume and scope of our business together and are actively seeking to expand the ODX customer base to include other banks and small business lenders. ODX was previously known as OnDeck-as-a-Service.


• | Extend Customer Lifetime Value. We believe we have an opportunity to increase revenue and loyalty from new and existing customers, thereby extending customer lifetime value. We continue to add benefits to our customer offerings to increase engagement and usage of our platform. For example, in 2018, we introduced line of credit instant funding, which allows our customers to more quickly access funds, and we continuously explore ways to enhance our loan offerings and features. Our publicly announced plans to enter the equipment finance market are driven by our goal of offering both new and existing customers another lending solution to match their needs. 

Our Loans and Loan Pricing
We offer term loans and lines of credit to eligible small businesses. We currently offer term loans from $5,000 to $500,000. The original term of each individual term loan ranges from 3 to 36 months. Customers repay our term loans through fixed, automatic ACH collections from their business bank account on either a daily or weekly basis. We offer a revolving line of credit with fixed 6 or 12 month level-yield amortization on amounts outstanding and automated weekly ACH payments. We currently offer lines of credit from $6,000 to $100,000. In addition to originating our own loans, we also purchase certain term loans and lines of credit from our issuing bank partner who originates those loans.
Our term loan and line of credit sizes and pricing are based on a risk assessment generated by our proprietary data and analytics engine, which includes the OnDeck Score. Pricing is determined primarily based on the customer’s OnDeck Score, the business owner's FICO® score, loan term and origination channel. Loans originated through direct marketing and strategic partners are generally priced lower than loans originated through FAPs due to the commission structure of the FAP program as well as the relative risk profile of the borrowers within the channel. Additionally, we may offer discounts to qualified repeat customers as part of our loyalty program.
For all of our term loans and lines of credit, our customers are quoted multiple pricing metrics to provide transparency and help them better understand the cost of their loan, including:
•the total repayment amount in dollars;
•the annual percentage rate, or APR;
•the average monthly payment amount; and 
•the “Cents on Dollar,” or COD, which expresses the total amount of interest that will be paid per dollar borrowed. 
In order to provide our customers with pricing transparency, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted the SMART Box™ - which stands for “Straightforward Metrics Around Rate and Total cost,” a model pricing disclosure and comparison tool introduced by the Innovative Lending Platform Association, or ILPA, of which we are a founding member. The SMART Box presents prospective customers with the key terms of their loan and several standardized pricing metrics to evaluate the cost of the term loan or line of credit, including the total cost of capital, APR, the average monthly payback amount, and the COD cost of the loan.
7

Cents on Dollar borrowed reflects the monthly interest paid by a customer to us for a loan, and does not include the loan origination fee and the repayment of the principal of the loan. As of December 31, 2018, the APRs of our term loans ranged from 9.1% to 99.8% and the APRs of our lines of credit ranged from 11.0% to 63.2%. Because many of our loans are short term in nature and APR is calculated on an annualized basis, we believe that small business customers tend to evaluate these short term loans primarily on a Cents on Dollar borrowed basis rather than APR. 
We believe that our product pricing has historically been higher than traditional bank loans to small businesses and lower than certain non-bank small business financing alternatives such as merchant cash advances. The weighted average APR for our term loans and lines of credit declined from 54.4% in 2014 to 41.4% in 2016. During the same period, the weighted average COD per dollar borrowed per month for our term loans declined from 2.32 cents to 1.82 cents. Since mid 2016, we implemented price increases which increased our weighted average COD and weighted average APR. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our weighted average COD per dollar borrowed per month and weighted average APR were 2.14 cents and 46.9%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our weighted average COD per dollar borrowed per month and weighted average APR were 1.95 cents and 43.7%, respectively. We intend to continue to manage the pricing of our loans to optimize between risk-adjusted yields and loan origination volume. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Pricing.
Our Risk Management
Our management team has operated the business through both strong and weak economic environments and has developed significant risk management experience and protocols. 
Risk is overseen by the risk management committee, which is comprised of certain members of our board of directors and meets regularly to examine our credit and enterprise risks. The risk management committee also has established management committees that are comprised of members of our management team that monitor key risks and we have teams within the company that monitor and report on various enterprise risks. Credit risk is the most fundamental and significant risk faced by the Company.
We make credit decisions based on real-time performance data about our small business customers. We believe that the data and analytics powering the OnDeck Score can predict the creditworthiness of a small business better than models that rely solely on the personal credit score of the small business owner. Our analysis suggests that the current iteration of our proprietary credit-scoring model has become more accurate than previous versions at identifying credit risk in small businesses across a range of credit risk profiles than personal credit scores alone.
In addition, because our loans generally require automated payment of principal and interest either daily or weekly and allow for ongoing data collection, we obtain early-warning indicators that provide a higher degree of visibility not just on individual loans, but also on macro portfolio trends. Insights gleaned from such real-time performance data provide the opportunity for us to be agile and adapt to changing conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average length of a term loan at origination was approximately 11.8 months compared to 12.1 months for the year ended December 31, 2017. We believe the rapid amortization and recovery of amounts from the short duration of our portfolio helps to mitigate our overall loss exposure.
Our credit risk team is responsible for portfolio management, allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, credit model validation and underwriting performance. This team engages in numerous risk management activities, including reporting on performance trends, and monitoring of portfolio concentrations.
We also focus on a variety of other enterprise risks and processes, including but not limited to:

• | Liquidity and Market Risks. Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not maintain adequate financial resources to meet our financial obligations. We mitigate liquidity risk by using a funding strategy that allows us to access debt facilities and the securitization markets through a diverse set of banks, insurance companies and other institutional lenders, which reduces our dependence on any one source of capital. Market risks relate to potential implications of fluctuating interest rate or currency exchange rates on our operations or financial results. Liquidity and market risks are monitored by an asset liability committee. 


• | Operational Risks including: (1) ensuring our IT systems, security protocols and business continuity plans are maintained, reviewed and tested; (2) establishing and testing internal controls with respect to financial reporting; (3) recruiting and retaining talent and (4) other risks associated with developing and executing business strategies.


• | Regulatory Risks. Regulatory risk involves regularly reviewing the legal and regulatory environment to ensure compliance with existing laws and anticipate future legal or regulatory changes that may impact us. 


• | Competitive Risks including threat of new and existing market entrants.

Our Subsidiaries
We conduct certain of our operations through subsidiaries that support our business. We offer bank clients a comprehensive technology and services platform that facilitates online lending to small business customers through our ODX subsidiary. Several of our other subsidiaries are special purpose vehicles acting as the borrower in different asset-backed revolving debt facilities and one other subsidiary is a special purpose vehicle acting as the issuer under our current asset-backed securitization vehicle.
See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report for more information regarding our subsidiaries.
Our Information Technology and Security
Our Information Security program is based on principles that reflect our goals and that form the foundation of the policies, standards and procedures of our Information Security Policy. These underlying principles expand on traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability models to provide a framework for: safeguarding critical and sensitive company, customer and other information we maintain in many formats including databases, electronic mail and paper documents; protecting critical company business applications, both those under development and those in live production environments; securing many types of computing devices including data center assets through desktop and laptop computers; protecting company communications networks including wireless, voice over IP and Internet connectivity; and facilitating discussions with third parties when establishing contracts or service level agreements governing information security arrangements.
Our network is configured with multiple layers of security with the goal of detecting, preventing, and responding to unauthorized access to or probing of our information. In addition to regular internal vulnerability scans, we submit to external penetration testing to validate our defenses and to identify areas for improvement.
Our applications are engineered with a focus on security and protected using a number of preventative controls in addition to in-code measures.  We also use security protocols for communication among applications.  All of our public Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, and websites use Transport Layer Security Applications and are analyzed for security flaws internally by a dedicated team in order to maintain our security posture through continued development and functional improvement.
Our systems infrastructure is deployed on a private cloud hosted in co-located redundant data centers in New Jersey and Colorado. We believe that we have enough physical capacity to support our operations for the foreseeable future. We have multiple layers of redundancy to support the reliability of network service and achieved 99.9% monthly uptime. We also have a working data redundancy model with comprehensive backups of our databases and software.
Our Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.
We have registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and Australia for “OnDeck,” “ODX,” “OnDeck Score,” “OnDeck Marketplace,” the OnDeck logo and many other trademarks. We also have filed other trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it will be beneficial.

Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 587 full-time employees in our New York, Denver, Virginia, Sydney, Australia, and Toronto, Canada offices as well as employees who work remotely. 
In 2018 we refreshed our core values to help us focus even more on helping our small business customers succeed:

One Team | We know that the best outcomes happen when we work together. 
Switched On | We are passionate about small businesses, our company, and each other. 
Driven to Win | Every decision counts in our journey to lend responsibly and win with integrity. 
Focused Innovation | We invent where it differentiates us and leverage existing solutions where it doesn't. 
Strike the Right Balance | Our entrepreneurial culture keeps us nimble and standards and processes keep us well-managed.

We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory and we have not had any work stoppages. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Government Regulation
We and our bank partners are affected by laws and regulations, and judicial interpretations of those laws and regulations, that apply to businesses in general, as well as to commercial lending. This includes a range of laws, regulations and standards that address information security, privacy, fair lending and anti-discrimination, fair sales/marketing practices, transparency, credit bureau reporting, anti-money laundering and sanctions screening, licensing and interest rates, among other things. Because we are not a bank and are engaged in commercial lending, we are not subject to certain of the laws and rules that only apply to banks and that has federal preemption over certain state laws and regulations. However, we purchase term loans and lines of credit from our issuing bank partner that is subject to laws and rules applicable to banks and commercial lenders. We may consider, among other regulatory alternatives, full, limited or other special purposes state bank charters; the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s full service national bank charter or its special purpose national bank charter for FinTech companies; or other alternatives or chartering regimes. 
State Lending Regulations
Interest Rate Regulations
Although the federal government does not regulate the maximum interest rates that may be charged on commercial loan transactions, some states have enacted commercial rate laws specifying the maximum legal interest rate at which commercial loans can be made in their state. We only offer commercial loans. All loans originated directly by us provide that they are to be governed by Virginia law. Virginia does not have rate limitations on commercial loans of $5,000 or more or licensing requirements for commercial lenders making such loans. Our underwriting team and senior members of our credit risk team are headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and that is where our commercial loan contracts are made. With respect to loans where we work with a partner or issuing bank, the issuing bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank in connection with its commercial loans.
Licensing Requirements
In states and jurisdictions that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we typically make term loans and extend lines of credit directly to customers pursuant to Virginia law, which is the governing law we require in the underlying loan agreements with our customers. There are five states that have licensing requirements where we do not make any term loans and instead purchase term loans made by an issuing bank partner: California, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont. Beginning in 2016, we began to acquire line of credit draws under lines of credit extended by our issuing bank partner in those states. Due to regulatory limitations, we do not originate lines of credit directly in those five states. In addition to those five states, there are other states and jurisdictions that require a license or have other requirements or restrictions applicable to commercial loans, including both term loans and lines of credit, and may not honor a Virginia choice of law. In these other states, historically we have originated some term loans and lines of credit directly but purchased other term loans and lines of credit from issuing bank partners, the foregoing depending on the requirements or restrictions of these other states. Those other states assert either that their own licensing laws and requirements or requirements should generally apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks, or

apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks of certain principal amounts, with certain interest rates, to certain business entity types or based on other terms. In such other states and jurisdictions and in some other circumstances, term loans and lines of credit are made by an issuing bank partner that is not subject to such state law, and may be sold to us. Certain lines of credit are extended by an issuing bank partner in all 50 states in the U.S. and we may purchase extensions under those lines of credit. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, loans made by issuing bank partners constituted 18.9%, 22.6% and 22.2%, respectively, of our total loan originations (including both term loans and draws on lines of credit). 
The issuing bank partner establishes its underwriting criteria for the issuing bank partner program in consultation with us. We recommend commercial loans to the issuing bank partner that meet the bank partner's underwriting criteria, at which point the issuing bank partner may elect to fund the term loan or extend the line of credit. If the issuing bank partner decides to fund the loan (including term loans and line of credit extensions), it retains the economics on the loan for the period that it owns the loan. The issuing bank partner earns origination fees from the customers who borrow from it and retains the interest paid during the period that the issuing bank partner owns the loan. In exchange for recommending loans to an issuing bank partner, we earn a marketing referral fee based on the loans recommended to, and originated by, that issuing bank partner. Historically, we have been the purchaser of the loans that we refer to issuing bank partners. Our agreement with our issuing bank partner also provides for a collateral account, which is maintained at the issuing bank. The account serves as cash collateral for the performance of our obligations under the relevant agreements, which among other things may include compliance with certain covenants, and also serves to indemnify the issuing bank partner for breaches by us of representations and warranties where it suffers damages as a result of the loans that we refer to it. Our current agreement with our issuing bank partner, Celtic Bank, or Celtic, expires October 2019 and the agreement automatically extends for one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Celtic is an industrial bank chartered by the state of Utah and makes small business and certain other loans. The agreement with Celtic may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party. We may in the future and from time to time work with a different bank partner, or multiple bank partners. 
We are not required to have licenses to make commercial loans under any state laws as currently in effect and our operations as presently conducted. Virginia, unlike some other jurisdictions, does not require licensing of commercial lenders. Because we make loans from Virginia in accordance with the Virginia choice of law in our loan agreements, we are not required, with respect to any loans we originate, to be licensed as a lender in other jurisdictions that honor the Virginia choice of law. 
Federal Lending Regulations
We are a commercial lender and as such there are federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations. These laws include, among others, portions of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Economic and Trade Sanctions rules, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, and Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices.  In addition, there are other federal laws that do not directly govern our business but with respect to which we have established certain procedures, including procedures to designed to protect our platform from being used to launder money.
Competition
The small business lending market is highly competitive and fragmented and we expect it to remain so in the future. Our principal competitors include traditional banks, legacy merchant cash advance providers, and newer, technology-enabled FinTech lenders. We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following:

• | ease of process to apply for a loan;


• | brand recognition and trust;


• | loan features, including amount, rate, term and repayment method;


• | loan product fit for business purpose;


• | transparent description of key terms;


• | effectiveness of underwriting;


• | speed of funding;


• | effectiveness of operational processes;

11


• | effectiveness of customer acquisition; and


• | customer experience.
