Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Our primary business is to develop novel medicines for use in the treatment of human viral diseases. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (“the Company”) has been developing novel technologies and approaches to create first-in-class and best-in-class antiviral drug candidates since its initial funding in 2008. Our focus is to pursue the development and commercialization of broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates that will transform the treatment and prophylaxis of viral diseases in humans. By concentrating our research and development efforts on viral replication inhibitors, we plan to leverage our infrastructure and expertise in these areas.
 
The Company was formerly incorporated in Nevada under the name Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On January 2, 2014, Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. sold substantially all of its assets to MusclePharm Corporation (“MusclePharm”), and, on the same day, merged with Cocrystal Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”) in a transaction accounted for as a reverse merger. Following the merger, the Company assumed Discovery’s business plan and operations. On March 18, 2014, the Company reincorporated in Delaware under the name Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.
 
On November 25, 2014, a subsidiary of the Company and affiliated entities completed a series of merger transactions. As a result, a subsidiary of the Company merged with RFS Pharma, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“RFS Pharma”).
 
The Company operates in only one segment. Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
 
Cocrystal Technology
 
We are developing antiviral therapeutics that inhibit the essential replication function of various viruses. Our first goal is to decrease the length of Hepatitis C (HCV) clinical treatment by advancing drug candidates targeting HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, HCV helicase, and the HCV NS5A protein. Additional goals include treating human and avian (bird) influenza virus and norovirus by discovering and developing drug candidates targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The polymerase inhibitors include both nucleosides (Nucs) and non-nucleosides (NNIs). To discover and design these inhibitors, we use a proprietary platform comprising computation, nucleoside and medicinal chemistry, X-ray crystallography, and our extensive know-how. We determine the structures of cocrystals containing the inhibitors bound to the enzyme or protein to guide our design. We also use advanced computational methods to screen and design product candidates using proprietary cocrystal structural information. In designing the candidates, we seek to anticipate and avert potential viral mutations leading to resistance. By designing and selecting drug candidates that interrupt the viral replication process and also have specific binding characteristics, we seek to develop drugs that are not only effective against both the virus and possible mutants of the virus, but which also have reduced off-target interactions that cause undesirable clinical side effects. While this approach is easy to describe, it is much more difficult to carry out. In particular, an extensive knowledge of viruses and drug targets is required. In addition, knowledge and experience in the fields of structural biology, enzymology, and nucleoside chemistry is required.

We developed our proprietary structure-based drug design and antiviral nucleoside chemistry under the guidance of Dr. Roger Kornberg, our Chief Scientist and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006, and Dr. Raymond Schinazi, our Chairman and a world leader in the area of nucleoside chemistry and the cofounder of several biotechnology companies focusing on antiviral drug discovery and development, including Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Idenix Pharmaceuticals, and Pharmasset, Inc. Our drug discovery process focuses on those parts of the enzymes to which drugs bind and on drug-enzyme interactions at the atomic level. Additionally, we have developed proprietary targeted in-house chemical libraries of nucleosides, non-nucleoside inhibitors, metal-binding inhibitors, and fragments. Our drug discovery process is different from traditional, empirical, medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative high-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes. We continue developing preclinical and clinical drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technology.
 
The Company’s proprietary technology integrates several powerful and specialized techniques:
 

(1) | Selection of viral drug targets amenable to broad-spectrum antiviral drug development and essential for viral genome replication; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Atomic resolution 3-D structure determination of drug binding pockets; 
(3) | In-depth computational analysis of conservation of drug-binding pockets and critical molecular interactions between antiviral inhibitors and amino acid residues of the target molecule’s drug-binding pocket; 
(4) | Cocrystal structure determinations to inform hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization processes; 
(5) | Molecular modeling and computer-guided lead discovery to support rational chemical modifications based on structure-activity relationships, or SAR, of candidate inhibitor compounds; 
(6) | Knowledge of enzymatic mechanisms to guide the design of drugs with exceptional affinity, specificity, and broad spectrum activity; and 
(7) | Platforms for rapid identification of antiviral enzyme inhibitors showing broad-spectrum antiviral capability. 

 
We have applied these techniques to develop antiviral inhibitors of three important viruses: hepatitis C, influenza, and norovirus.
 
Market-Driven Product Profiles
 
In all of our programs our goal is to develop best-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with high-barrier-to-drug resistance. An ideal product for an antiviral therapy would have at least the following characteristics:

(1) | Fast onset of action and /or shortened therapeutic time; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Good safety and tolerability profile; 
(3) | Effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease; 
(4) | High barrier to viral resistance; and 
(5) | Ease of administration, for example, a pill. 

 
Even at the discovery stage of drug development, we select compounds with these factors in mind. Furthermore, our technology is capable of delivering therapies that satisfy all of these key factors, as detailed below.

Fast onset of action and / or shortened therapeutic time: In order to improve patient care and penetrate the HCV marketplace, drugs are needed with faster onset of viral load lowering resulting in shorter therapeutic time. Current and known future influenza treatments shorten symptoms by only about 24 hours. Norovirus spreads readily among the affected and is in need of a fast acting therapeutic intervention. During the discovery and development phases we focus on this important clinical variable.
 
Safety and tolerability: All drugs have side effects, also referred to as adverse effects. These usually result from a drug’s ability to bind to human molecules (usually proteins). When this interaction is intentional (i.e., part of the drug’s mechanism of action), the adverse effects are classified as on-target effects. When this interaction is unintentional (i.e., resulting from the drug’s interaction with an unintended human molecule), the effects are called off-target effects. Our inhibitors target viral replication enzymes and a viral replication protein, which are generally unique to viruses. Because the targets are viral, not human, minimal adverse effects are possible. During the discovery phase, we evaluate candidate compounds for potential cross-reactivity with human replication enzymes and attempt to eliminate those compounds that are cross-reactive with humans.
 
Broadly effective against major strains responsible for a viral disease: For any given viral disease, there are different strains of viruses that cause the disease. For example, there are six major strains of the virus known to cause hepatitis C (HCV). These strains are termed “genotypes.” Each HCV genotype is common in some parts of the world and rare in others. Also, there are three types of influenza viruses, A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal flu. Influenza A viruses can also cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza C is a subtype of the influenza virus that tends to cause only mild illness, and is not responsible for seasonal or pandemic infections. Our goal is to design and develop drug candidates that will be effective on the broadest possible range of viruses causing the disease.


Many antiviral drugs available today are effective only against certain strains of viruses and less effective or not effective at all against other strains. To address this problem, we are developing drug candidates that specifically target viral proteins involved in viral replication. Despite the various strains of virus that may exist, these enzymes are essentially identical (highly conserved) among all strains of a given virus. By targeting these conserved replication enzymes, our antiviral compounds are designed and tested to be effective against major virus strains. Replication enzymes are generally conserved not only among subtypes of a given virus but also among many different viruses, creating an opportunity for the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs.
 
High Barrier to drug resistance: Drug resistance is a major obstacle to developing effective antiviral therapies. Viruses can reproduce rapidly and in enormous quantities in infected human cells. During viral replication, random changes in the viral genome, called mutations, spontaneously develop. If such a mutation occurs in a region of the viral genome that is targeted by a given antiviral therapy, that therapy may no longer be effective against the mutated virus. These mutated or “resistant” viruses can freely infect and multiply even in individuals who have received drug treatment. In some cases, resistant virus strains may even predominate. For example, in the 2009 swine influenza pandemic, the predominant strain was resistant to the best available therapies.
 
The Company’s focus on viral replication proteins can overcome the obstacle of viral resistance. We identify and target critical components of viral replication proteins that are essential for function, therefore, sensitive to change. Any mutation in these critical components is likely to inactivate the replication protein and, in turn, render the virus incapable of replicating. Because such mutations cannot propagate, the virus cannot effectively develop resistance to the enzyme inhibitors we employ. We test the effectiveness of our compounds against potential viral mutations and select compounds with the highest barrier to resistance.
 
Ease of administration: We select compounds for development that can be administered orally, preferably once daily, and in pill-form.

Research and Development update
 
Therapeutic Targets
 
Hepatitis C: A large competitive market with opportunity for shorter treatment regimens
 
HCV is a highly competitive and changing market. Currently, the standard treatment varies with the genotype of the HCV infection. Prior to late 2013, treatment included peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, along with a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir). In late 2013, sofosbuvir, a drug belonging to a new class of drugs called “nucleoside analogs” or “Nucs,” was approved to treat hepatitis C. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (the most common HCV genotype in the US), sofosbuvir was administered in combination with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. In patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, however, sofosbuvir could be effectively administered in combination with ribavirin, without the need for peginterferon alpha. Since 2014, several new combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been approved for the treatment of HCV infection. These include Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir), Viekira Pak (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir), Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir), Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir) and Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir).
 
We anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2036, given the large prevalence of HCV infection worldwide. The 2017 World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report estimates that 71 million people worldwide have chronic HCV infections. Although injection drug use is the major route of HCV transmission in some regions, the provision of effective harm reduction services has been inadequate. Globally, 5% of health-care-related injections remained unsafe. As a result, an estimated 1.75 million new HCV infections occurred worldwide in 2015.
 
We have four classes of HCV DAAs targeting three different HCV replication proteins - NS5B polymerase (NNI and Nuc), NS5A, and NS3 helicase. These DAAs could be developed as part of an all-oral, pan-genotypic combination regimen with significant upside. Our focus is on developing what is now called ultrashort treatment regimens from 2 to 6 weeks in length. Such a combination treatment with different classes of DAAs has the potential to change the paradigm of treatment for HCV with its efficacy, higher barrier to viral resistance, improved compliance, and shorter duration of treatment. These strategies could allow us to expand and broaden our portfolio in the HCV antiviral therapeutic area globally and could lead to a high and fast cure rate, to improve compliance, and to simplified treatment duration. To our knowledge no competing company has yet developed a short HCV treatment of 4 weeks or less successfully with a high (>95%) sustained virologic response (SVR) at week 12.
 
CC-31244, HCV NNI, is a potential best in class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. The Company completed a Phase 1a study in Canada in September 2016, with favorable safety results in a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected subjects. The Company is presently conducting a Phase 1b study in HCV genotype 1 subjects. Cocrystal Pharma presented the interim results from the 1b study at the APASL in February 2017. HCV-infected subjects treated with CC-31244 had a rapid and marked decline in HCV RNA levels, and slow viral rebound after treatment. Results of this study suggest that CC-31244 could be an important component in a fast acting, shortened duration all-oral HCV combination therapy. The Company has three additional preclinical candidates: a pan-genotypic nucleoside inhibitor, an NS5A inhibitor, and an NS3 helicase inhibitor.
 
The Company is progressing clinically while seeking a partner for further clinical development of CC-31244 and the preclinical candidates.
 
Influenza: A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease.
 
Influenza is a severe respiratory illness, caused primarily by influenza A or B virus. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that influenza is linked to 49,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. The worldwide market for antiviral drugs to treat influenza was $3.8 billion in 2012 and is expected to grow to $6 billion by 2018 (bccResearch).

Influenza viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause both seasonal, endemic infections and periodic, unpredictable pandemics. The worst pandemic on record, in 1918, killed approximately 50 million people worldwide. Human infections caused by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have raised concern about the emergence of another pandemic. The histopathology of fatal influenza virus pneumonias has been documented over the past 120 years. Strikingly, the spectrum of pathologic changes described in the 1918 influenza pandemic is not significantly different from the histopathology observed in other less lethal pandemics or even in deaths occurring during seasonal influenza outbreaks.
 
Currently, approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective, but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus that are resistant to the approved treatments osteltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu(R)) and zanamavir (Relenza(R)) have appeared, and in some cases predominate. For example, the predominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant to Tamiflu. These drugs target viral neuraminidase enzymes, which are not highly conserved between viral strains. In fact, different influenza virus strains such as H1N1 and H5N1 are named according to their respective differences in hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
 
The Company has several preclinical candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, has been selected as a preclinical lead. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of the influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA), and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. We plan to initiate IND-enabling studies this year. Antiviral product candidates that are competitors for the Company’s influenza program are, VX-787, being developed by Janssen, and S-033188, being developed by Shionogi/Roche. S-033188 was approved as Xofluza in Japan on February 23, 2018.
 
Norovirus: A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90% of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world.
 
Norovirus is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms include fatigue, fever and dehydration. Noroviruses are a major cause of gastrointestinal illness in closed and crowded environments, having become notorious for their common occurrence in hospitals, nursing homes, child care facilities, and cruise ships. In the United States alone, noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and are estimated to cause 21 million illnesses each year and contribute to 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world. In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus infection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. Few companies, including Chimerix, are developing antiviral treatments for this disease. However, three candidate vaccines are currently in early stages of clinical testing by GlaxoSmithKline, Ligocyte and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
 
By targeting viral replication enzymes, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups of norovirus. Also, because of the significant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals, new antiviral therapeutic approaches may warrant an accelerated path to market. The Company is developing inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of norovirus. It owns one of the earliest patents on nucleosides that could treat norovirus infections. Similar to the hepatitis C virus polymerases, this enzyme is essential to viral replication and is highly conserved between all noroviral genogroups. Therefore, an inhibitor of this enzyme might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic agent, when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example. We have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase crystals, and have identified promising NNIs. We are implementing the platform and approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs.

Genoscience, BioLineRx and CTTQ: On February 1, 2012, Discovery, now a subsidiary of the Company, in collaboration with Genoscience entered into a worldwide license agreement with BioLineRx (NASDAQ: BLRX; TASE: BLRX), a biopharmaceutical development company, to develop and commercialize BL-8030, an orally available treatment for hepatitis C. The agreement included upfront royalties and milestones payable to both companies. BL-8030 was co-developed through a joint collaboration between Discovery and Genoscience. Advanced preclinical studies were conducted in collaboration with CTTQ for China and Hong Kong markets. This collaboration was terminated in February 2016.
 
University of Pittsburgh and Emory University: Discovery assigned its patent rights to the patent titled “3’-Azido Purinenucleotide Prodrugs for Treatment Of Viral Infections” to University of Pittsburgh on November 21, 2014. This patent is jointly owned by Discovery, the University of Pittsburgh and Emory University. Dr. Raymond Schinazi, is an inventor, and also a faculty member at Emory University.
 
Duke University and Emory University: In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Duke University and Emory University to license various patents and know-how to use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies for developing a possible cure for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV). On September 25, 2017 (“Termination Date”), the Company mutually terminated the agreement with Duke University and there are no further rights or obligations under this license agreement after the Termination Date.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense and rapidly changing competition as companies seek to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We know of several companies that have marketed or are developing products for the treatment of HCV or influenza, including Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Merck & Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Toyama Chemical Co., Shionogi/Roche and Abbvie, Inc. In particular, Gilead dominates the market for HCV with an estimated market share greater than 70%. Its products are widely considered effective.
 
In February 2017, Merck & Co. announced it would write off $2.9 billion (pretax) relating to a prior acquisition for a hepatitis C drug still in clinical trials. Meanwhile Gilead announced lower forecasted sales from its three hepatitis drugs. Many of these and other companies developing products for the other viral diseases that are of interest to us have substantially greater financial resources, expertise and capabilities than we do.
 
In August 2017, AbbVie, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), a once-daily, ribavirin-free treatment for adults with chronic hepatitis C virus infection across all major genotypes (GT1-6). Mavyret is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. Any product candidates we develop must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in other countries. The clinical testing of product candidates to establish their safety and efficacy in humans is subject to substantial statutory and regulatory requirements with which we must comply.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. Our chemistry laboratory can produce research scale (milligram-gram) quantities of our lead drug candidates. As such, our progress is often dependent on successful project execution by third party vendors.

Legacy Business
 
Our Legacy Business
 
Prior to the merger with Discovery on January 2, 2014, while operating as Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we were primarily engaged in the business of developing and manufacturing over-the-counter drug products (OTC) and cosmetic and beauty products for third parties. In addition, we marketed two lines of proprietary skin care products. All of these assets were sold to MusclePharm as part of the January 2, 2014 Asset Purchase Agreement in exchange for 1,200,000 shares of MusclePharm common stock which had a market value as of January 2, 2014 of $9,840,000. In addition, MusclePharm licensed back to us the patents we sold it for six months in exchange for our paying it a 5% royalty on gross sales.
 
While operating as Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we also owned a 45% interest in BetaZone Laboratories, LLC (“BetaZone”), which was engaged in the sale and license of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products in Latin America. We received no material royalties from BetaZone, which had licensed our proprietary technology. This technology was also sold to MusclePharm.
 
We were incorporated as a Nevada corporation on December 4, 2006 under the name International Surf Resorts Inc. We changed our name to Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on March 1, 2011 and we acquired Biozone Labs and our other subsidiaries on June 30, 2011. On January 30, 2014, we re-incorporated in Delaware. We acquired our current corporate structure and business operations following our merger with RFS Pharma, LLC effective November 25, 2014.
