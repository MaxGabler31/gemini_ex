Overview
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. We apply our insights into the chemistry and biology of proteases to develop orally delivered, small molecule inhibitors with high selectivity, potency and bioavailability that we believe will make them successful treatments for diseases. We have used these capabilities to develop a proprietary portfolio of novel, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors targeting hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”). We also are conducting preclinical development on a novel, oral Factor XIIa (“Factor XIIa”) inhibitor program, which initially is being advanced to provide a next generation of HAE therapeutics and which also offers the opportunity for expansion into other high unmet need indications in the future.
 Our primary focus is currently on developing oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE, for which we have two drug candidates in clinical trials. HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with symptoms that include episodes of debilitating and often painful swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. Despite having multiple therapies approved, we believe people living with HAE are in need of alternatives that better meet their objectives for quality of life and ease of disease control. Other than one oral therapy approved for prophylaxis, currently marketed therapies are all administered by injection, which patients can find challenging despite their efficacy because they can be painful, time consuming to deliver and difficult to store. We anticipate that there will be strong interest in safe and effective, orally delivered, small molecule treatments, and our strategy is to develop oral drug candidates for both on-demand and prophylactic use with the goal of providing patients with a complete set of oral options to treat their disease.
 Our belief that our therapies could fundamentally transform the manner in which HAE is treated is based upon extensive and continuing research we conduct with patients, physicians and payers. Recently we have conducted research to further understand the process that people living with HAE follow when determining what therapy to use and how to treat their attacks. We have discovered significant differences in how physicians believe their patients should, and do, treat their disease, compared to how people living with HAE actually treat the disease. Among our findings, we have learned that patients carry their on-demand treatment much less often, and treat attacks much less frequently, than physicians believe. When patients do treat, we believe they tend to delay that treatment excessively for reasons including not having their treatment with them, injection-associated pain, and lack of a private area for treatment. As a result, our data indicate that a significant majority of patients experience attacks that are more severe and last longer than if they treated earlier. Patient surveys have indicated to us, in contrast, that if provided with an oral on-demand therapy, they would expect to carry it 95% of the time, would expect to treat 94% of attacks, and 93% of patients would expect to treat their attacks earlier. This is the reason we believe that an oral on-demand therapy could represent such a significant advance.
 We have advanced our candidate sebetralstat (formerly known as KVD900) into Phase 3 clinical development as a potential oral, on-demand therapy for HAE attacks. In February 2021 we announced data from a Phase 2 efficacy trial in which sebetralstat demonstrated statistically and clinically significant responses across all primary and secondary endpoints. Based upon these data, we completed an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the fall of 2021 and initiated the Phase 3 KONFIDENT clinical trial in early 2022 that is intended to support a New Drug Application ("NDA") filing. KONFIDENT is a placebo-controlled crossover trial in which patients will treat a total of three attacks: one each with 300 mg sebetralstat, 600 mg sebetralstat, and placebo, given in a randomized sequence. The study is expected to enroll up to 114 patients in order to complete a total of 84 on the three-attack sequence. The primary endpoint of the study is time to onset of symptom relief using the PGI-C scale. KONFIDENT is expected to be conducted in approximately 60 sites in 20 countries. We expect data from KONFIDENT in the second half of 2023, and, if it is successful, we anticipate filing an NDA with the FDA in the first half of 2024.
 Sebetralstat has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA. A Pediatric Investigational Plan (“PIP”) has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for sebetralstat. In June 2022, we received formal notice from the European Commission that sebetralstat has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the European Union.
 KVD824 is our oral product candidate being developed for potential prophylactic treatment of HAE. We are currently conducting the Phase 2 KOMPLETE trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of KVD824 compared to placebo, with the primary endpoint of reduction in investigator-confirmed HAE attack rate over a 12-week treatment period. KOMPLETE will enroll a total of 48 patients in four arms, consisting of 300 mg twice daily, 600 mg twice daily, 900 mg twice daily, or placebo. KOMPLETE will be conducted in approximately 30 sites in 13 countries, and we currently anticipate data from this study in mid-2023.


Our oral Factor XIIa inhibitor program targets an enzyme that plays a key role in HAE, as the most upstream mechanism in the biochemical pathway that initiates HAE attacks. For this reason, we believe that inhibition of Factor XIIa will block the underlying causes of HAE attacks, including the uncontrolled generation of both plasma kallikrein and bradykinin which lead to swelling and pain. Clinical studies of an injectable Factor XIIa-inhibitory antibody have demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in preventing HAE attacks, and there are no known safety implications of long-term inhibition of this enzyme. We believe that our program has the potential to be the first orally delivered Factor XIIa inhibitor to enter clinical development, initially for HAE and over time for additional indications that are supported by scientific evidence. Our internal research team has discovered multiple series of low nanomolar potency Factor XIIa inhibitors that are both selective and orally bioavailable. We anticipate filing our first Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for this program in 2023.
 Our DME program to date has been focused on the development of an intravitreally administered small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, KVD001, which has completed a Phase 2 trial. DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in most developed countries and diabetes, the underlying cause of DME, is the leading cause of blindness among American adults according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We believe intravitreal plasma kallikrein inhibitors may be an effective alternative therapy to vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) inhibitors and further improve visual acuity and decrease macular thickening. We continue to evaluate our future potential efforts in this indication, including the potential for our oral drug candidates.
 Strategy
 Key elements of our strategy include:
 •Apply our deep scientific expertise in the area of serine proteases to develop novel oral therapies for indications with high unmet need. Our core scientific team has decades of experience working on protease inhibitors and developing compounds with high potency, selectivity and bioavailability. We have assembled a team of chemists and biologists who have demonstrated the ability to design and formulate multiple drug candidate programs from a broad variety of chemical classes, as indicated by our extensive intellectual property portfolio. Our initial focus is specifically on development of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE and DME, and Factor XIIa inhibitors for HAE and other indications; however, we believe our scientific capabilities also can be applied to other proteases to develop therapies for diseases with high unmet need.
 •Develop multiple HAE product candidates to provide a full set of therapeutic options for patients. We intend to develop best-in-class oral therapies for HAE and, to accomplish that goal, we plan to develop drug candidates for both on-demand and prophylactic use to provide patients with a complete set of oral options to treat their disease. Our most advanced program for HAE is sebetralstat, for which we are currently conducting the Phase 3 KONFIDENT clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebetratstat as a potential oral, on-demand therapy for treatment of HAE attacks. KVD824 is our next oral candidate to be developed as a potential oral prophylactic treatment for HAE, currently being evaluated in the Phase 2 KOMPLETE clinical trial. We believe our Factor XIIa inhibitor program may be able to offer patients a next generation of HAE therapies that may further enhance their options. 
 •Grow our capabilities internally as well as through strategic partnerships. We intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key milestones and in certain markets. For certain indications, such as HAE, that can be addressed by a focused organization, we intend to keep all program rights and develop internal sales and marketing capabilities. For programs that address larger markets or require greater infrastructure or resources, we may seek a partner that can provide those capabilities. Decisions on whether, and when, to engage in partnerships or collaborations will be based upon our evaluations of the relative risks and rewards of those collaborations at each point in the development cycle.
 Plasma Kallikrein in HAE and DME
 Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease enzyme that is a key mediator of inflammation and edema. The body modulates the downstream inflammatory effects of plasma kallikrein through a circulating inhibitor protein called C1-esterase inhibitor (“C1-INH”). Most patients with HAE have genetic mutations that lead to C1-INH deficiency, which results in an inability to control activated plasma kallikrein in affected tissues. This excessive activation leads to inflammation, edema, and pain.


Published laboratory work has shown that the vitreous fluid of the eye is also a site of increased plasma kallikrein in DME. In diabetic patients, the retina is one of a few tissues in which edema develops. Under normal circumstances the eye is protected from the diffusion of plasma proteins by an effective blood vessel barrier. In diabetes this barrier becomes less effective and allows plasma proteins such as plasma kallikrein to enter the retina and vitreous. While C1-INH can also to enter by the same route, animal models of DME have shown that the concentration of C1-INH in the vitreous fluid is insufficient to fully suppress the effects of plasma kallikrein on retinal edema. Over time, this edema leads to retinal damage that causes blindness.
 Hereditary Angioedema
Disease Overview
 HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people, according to published information from an HAE patient advocacy group. Excessive plasma kallikrein activation that is not sufficiently controlled by C1-INH leads to HAE attacks, which can vary with regard to the affected tissue or organ and severity. HAE attacks include episodes of intense swelling usually in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. They often lead to temporary disfiguration of various body parts including the hands, feet, face, body trunk, and genitals. In addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that is caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation.
 Attacks can occur spontaneously although they often are associated with anxiety, stress, minor trauma, surgery, or illnesses. Commonly patients are alerted to an impending attack by prodromal symptoms which include rash, fatigue, and muscle aches. Trauma to the oral cavity caused by dental procedures makes HAE patients particularly vulnerable to airway attacks. The frequency of HAE attacks is highly variable, with some patients having attacks several times per week and others very infrequently. Population studies have shown that the median number of attacks per month for patients is approximately one, and approximately 90% of patients have two or fewer attacks per month. Although life-threatening airway swelling is rare, at least half of HAE patients have experienced at least one such attack and airway attacks remain a major cause of mortality in HAE patients. The severity of attacks is unpredictable and not related to their underlying frequency. A patient with only one attack per year can nevertheless be at risk of suffering a laryngeal attack.
 HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that a defect in only one copy of the gene leads to symptoms and that it occurs at similar rates in both males and females. The most common cause of HAE is a defect or mutation in the gene responsible for the production of C1-INH. While HAE most often results from the inheritance of a defective gene from a parent, it is estimated that up to 25% of cases also arise from spontaneous mutations. Patients with C1-INH-related disease are classified as Type 1 or Type 2; Type 1 is the most common form and results in low levels of circulating C1-INH and Type 2 results in production of a low function protein. An additional form of HAE, often referred to as normal C1-INH HAE, can occur in patients with normal levels of C1-INH for a variety of reasons including mutations in genes for Factor 12, plasminogen or angiopoetin. Moreover, bradykinin-induced acute attacks of angioedema can occur idiopathically in individuals for which a hereditary cause has not yet been identified. Excessive formation of bradykinin can also be caused by increased circulation of estrogens, reduced elimination of bradykinin, or through use of drugs such as ACE inhibitors.
 C1-INH is a natural plasma-borne protein that is an inhibitor of multiple serine proteases in both the complement and kallikrein kinin systems. C1-INH is the predominant physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, and thereby suppresses the generation of bradykinin, a potent hormone produced by plasma kallikrein, that activates its receptors on blood vessels to increase vascular leakage. Uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity leads to the edema that is the hallmark of HAE. Selective plasma kallikrein inhibitors and a bradykinin receptor antagonist are approved therapies for HAE. As such, plasma kallikrein is a clinically validated target for HAE and previous studies have demonstrated that plasma kallikrein inhibition can both treat and prevent HAE attacks.


Current Treatments and Market Opportunities
 There are a number of marketed and development stage therapeutics for HAE which provide evidence that inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity will give therapeutic benefit in HAE. Lanadelumab (Takhzyro®) is a monoclonal antibody against plasma kallikrein indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE. The prescribing information recommends subcutaneous administration every two weeks, though dosing at more extended intervals may be considered in some patients. Ecallantide (Kalbitor®) is a small protein inhibitor of plasma kallikrein that is approved for treatment of acute attacks of HAE. While effective, ecallantide has been associated with cases of anaphylaxis and its labeling approval by the FDA includes a black box warning limiting its administration to healthcare professionals with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis and HAE, and requiring close monitoring of patients. Other therapies provide C1-INH replacement to control plasma kallikrein levels. Marketed C1-INH replacement therapies include Cinryze® and Haegarda® for prophylaxis, and Berinert® for treatment of acute attacks, all of which are purified from human plasma, and Ruconest® which is a recombinant product also for treatment of acute attacks. Icatibant (Firazyr®) is a synthetic peptide-based antagonist that blocks the activity of bradykinin and is indicated for treatment of acute attacks. All of these products are administered by injection, which is typically less convenient for patients and has the potential to reduce compliance. Berotralstat (ORLADEYOTM) is an oral prophylactic treatment which was launched in 2021. As a result of the lifelong nature of HAE and the challenges related to taking many of the injected therapies, patient surveys consistently indicate an overwhelming desire of patients for an oral therapy. We believe that a safe and effective oral agent has the potential to transform treatment for this disease. We also believe that opportunities exist for both acute and prophylactic treatments, and we intend to develop drug candidates for both on-demand and prophylactic use, with the goal of providing patients with a complete set of oral options to treat their disease.
 We believe a further future market opportunity may exist in treatment of normal C1-INH HAE. Estimates of the size of this patient population vary widely, but we believe that the nature of normal C1-INH HAE disease may make prophylaxis less attractive for these patients than a safe and rapidly effective on-demand plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy.
 Our Portfolio of HAE Programs
 Our strategy is to evaluate and develop multiple oral molecules in pursuit of best-in-class therapies for HAE patients, with an initial focus on treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 HAE. The first of these product candidates being evaluated in later stage clinical trials is sebetralstat. A positive Phase 2 clinical trial for sebetralstat as a potential on-demand treatment for HAE attacks was completed in February 2021, and we are currently conducting the Phase 3 KONFIDENT clinical trial. Our second oral treatment in development for potential prophylactic treatment for HAE is KVD824, which is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2 KOMPLETE clinical trial.
 Sebetralstat
 Evidence from studies using therapies approved for the treatment of acute HAE attacks shows that earlier treatment has a powerful impact on the efficacy outcomes. Despite clear evidence that early treatment markedly reduces attack duration, treatment is often delayed. In one outcome study of 207 HAE attacks, attack duration was 2.75-fold shorter when treatment was administered within 1 hour of attack onset (6.1 hours versus 16.8 hours (p<0.001)), yet treatment was administered more than 1 hour after attack onset in nearly 60% of attacks, and for 30% of attacks treatment was administered more than five hours after attack onset. We believe this delay in administration is due to many factors including the inconvenience of preparation and administration as well as the discomfort of injectable therapies. An oral therapy has the potential to overcome these and lower the barrier for treatment for patients. The combination of the rapid uptake of sebetralstat to very high blood levels and the likelihood of earlier dosing by patients, could lead to much better disease management and prevention of attacks reaching the critical stage of significant swelling and discomfort. We therefore believe that a safe, oral on-demand treatment has the potential to become a preferred alternative for patients currently using injectable treatments, including both acute and prophylactic therapies.
 In February 2021 we announced data from a Phase 2 efficacy trial in which sebestralstat demonstrated statistical and clinically significant responses across all primary and secondary endpoints. KVD900-201 was a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial investigating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of 600 mg sebetralstat as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. The trial met its primary endpoint comparing the time to use of rescue treatment within 12 hours on sebetralstat versus placebo (p=0.001) with rates of use at 12 hours of 15.1% following treatment with sebetralstat versus 30.2% after placebo. The trial also met all secondary endpoints: reduced worsening of attacks (p<0.0001; PGI-S or use of rescue) and reduced time to onset of symptom relief measured using both PGI-C (p<0.0001) and VAS (p<0.0001).


Based upon these data, we completed an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the fall of 2021 and initiated the Phase 3 KONFIDENT clinical trial in early 2022 that is intended to support an NDA filing. KONFIDENT is a placebo-controlled crossover trial in which patients will treat a total of three attacks: one each with 300 mg sebetralstat, 600 mg sebetralstat, and placebo, given in a randomized sequence. The study is expected to enroll up to 114 patients in order to complete a total of 84 on the three-attack sequence. The primary endpoint of the study is time to onset of symptom relief using the PGI-C scale. We agreed with the FDA that this is an appropriate primary endpoint for a registration-directed trial, and in the Phase 2 study, sebetralstat achieved this endpoint in a highly statistically significant manner. KONFIDENT is expected to be conducted in approximately 60 sites in 20 countries. We expect data from KONFIDENT in the second half of 2023, and, if it is successful, we currently anticipate filing an NDA in the first half of 2024.
 Sebetralstat has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA. A PIP has also been approved by the EMA for sebetralstat. In June 2022, we received formal notice from the European Commission that sebetralstat has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the European Union.
 KVD824
 KVD824 is our oral product candidate which is being developed for potential prophylactic treatment of HAE. We are currently conducting the Phase 2 KOMPLETE trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of KVD824 compared to placebo, with the primary endpoint of reduction in investigator-confirmed HAE attack rate over a 12-week treatment period. KOMPLETE will enroll a total of 48 patients in four arms, consisting of 300 mg twice daily, 600 mg twice daily, 900 mg twice daily, or placebo. KOMPLETE will be conducted in approximately 30 sites in 13 countries, and we currently anticipate data from this study in mid-2023.
 Factor XIIa
 Factor XIIa is an enzyme that plays a key role in HAE as the most upstream mediator in the biochemical pathway that initiates HAE attacks. For this reason, we believe that inhibition of Factor XIIa will block the underlying mechanism of HAE attacks, including the uncontrolled generation of both plasma kallikrein and bradykinin which cause swelling and pain. Clinical studies of an injectable Factor XIIa-inhibitory antibody have demonstrated efficacy in preventing HAE attacks, and there are no published safety concerns of long-term inhibition of this enzyme. We believe that our program has the potential to be the first orally delivered Factor XIIa inhibitor to enter clinical development, initially for HAE and over time for additional indications that are supported by scientific evidence.
 We have identified multiple series of structurally distinct, potent, selective, and oral FXIIa inhibitors. Within our lead series we are performing advance profiling of several lead molecules with FXIIa IC50 <10nM, selectivity > 1000 fold vs closely related serine proteases, and high oral availability in two preclinical species. Importantly, the pharmacokinetic profiles for these compounds meet our benchmark targeted exposures for QD dosing based on human scaling for the prophylactic prevention of HAE attacks. Currently two of these molecules are in non-GLP rat toxicology and we have additional compounds progressing to toxicological studies. Our strategy is to advance multiple candidates through early in vivo toxicology and progress at least two compounds from this series into GLP studies in the upcoming year.
 The pharmacology of this lead series is exemplified by KV998086, which has undergone extensive ADME and pharmacology profiling. The FXIIa IC50 for KV998086 is 8.3 nM and its oral availability in both rats and dogs is >70%. The plasma half-life and human scaling is consistent with once daily dosing to maintain plasma exposures sufficient to provide near complete inhibition of FXIIa-mediated plasma kallikrein generation and block high molecular weight kininogen (HK) cleavage that results in generation of bradykinin.


The figures below show that KV998086 potently inhibits dextran sulfate-stimulated generation of plasma kallikrein (PKa) and HK cleavage in whole human plasma, using an assay that characterized sebetralstat (KVD900) clinical pharmacology.
 
The figures below show that pretreatment with orally administered KV998086 protected mice from captopril-induced vascular permeability measured by the extravasation of Evans blue dye into larynx and tracheal tissues and from carrageenan-stimulated paw edema. In both preclinical models, KV998086 was as effective as FXII knockout (FXIIKO) in the protection from edema, suggesting that oral KV998086 provided strong inhibition of kallikrein kinin system-mediated angioedema in vivo.

In addition to the series of FXIIa inhibitors described above, our internal research team has discovered several structurally distinct series of low nanomolar potency Factor XIIa inhibitors that are selective and orally bioavailable. It is our expectation that this portfolio of compounds will provide multiple opportunities for the clinical development of a once-daily administered oral FXIIa inhibitor with efficacy comparable to leading injectable therapies for HAE prophylaxis. In addition, the diversity within our portfolio creates opportunities to identify oral FXIIa inhibitors that fulfill the target profile needed for the treatment of other FXIIa mediated diseases, including thrombosis and other diseases associated with edema and inflammation. We anticipate filing the first IND for a Factor XIIa inhibitor program candidate in 2023.


Competition
 In treating HAE, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including Takhzyro and Cinryze, marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited (“Takeda”) in the United States and Europe for the prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents; Firazyr, marketed by Takeda in the United States, Europe and certain other geographic territories for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; Kalbitor, an injectable plasma kallikrein inhibitor marketed by Takeda for the resolution of acute attacks in adolescent and adult HAE patients; Berinert, marketed by CSL Behring for treatment of acute abdominal, facial or laryngeal attacks of HAE in adults and adolescents, and Haegarda, also marketed by CSL Behring, for prophylaxis; Ruconest, marketed by Pharming Group for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; and Orladeyo, an oral prophylactic treatment marketed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are also aware of other companies that are engaged in the clinical development of other HAE treatments, including Pharvaris GmbH, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are aware of several other companies in preclinical development of potential HAE therapies.

 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("the FDC Act") and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Pharmaceutical products - such as small molecule drugs and biological products, or biologics used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, with the exception that the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of drugs via New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) does not apply to the approval of biologics. In contrast, biologics are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”) via a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically take many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.


Clinical trials to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into patients, the product is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, determine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit -risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient when either (1) the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) the single trial is supported by other confirmatory evidence.
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug or biologic in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life- threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug or biologic.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Under an approved NDA or BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. An NDA or BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the NDA or BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the FDA's determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA. An NDA or BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the drug or biologic has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the NDA or BLA submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug and biologic products, as well as drug and biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the NDA or BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug or biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory.


After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA or BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product's safe use (“ETASU”). An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product's safety or efficacy.
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved NDA or BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDABLA, or supplement to an approved NDA or BLA, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing original NDAs and BLAs.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition - generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing, and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug or biological product and its potential orphan disease use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the approved indication. For large molecule drugs, sameness is determined based on the principal molecular structural features of a product.
 During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, or in the case of a biological product, one containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product can be considered clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA user fee.
 Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologic products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
 Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.


Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologic products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or BLAs, or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), provides a six-month extension of any non-patent exclusivity for a drug or biologic as well as a six-month extension of patent exclusivity for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug or biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug or biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drugs and biologics manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a drug or biologic product's manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the NDA in timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.


Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. An approved ANDA product is considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA-holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the “notice letter”). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”) which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug unless the application contains a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the application may be submitted one year prior to expiration of the NCE exclusivity. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA for a generic version of the drug may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 Certain changes to an approved drug, such as the approval of a new indication, the approval of a new strength, and the approval of a new condition of use, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of the three-year exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA package insert.
 Patent Term Extension
 The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for the extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval) up to a maximum of five years. The time can be reduced for any time FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence.


The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. However, the USPTO may not grant an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested.
 The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. The application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and for patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, pharmaceutical and biotechnology company activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. In addition, the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are subject to change.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the “ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.


Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies' marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations, and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain advance practices nurses and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Commercial distribution of products requires compliance with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. In addition, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. Certain local jurisdictions also require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Sales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.


Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to enter into government contracts, oversight monitoring, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings.
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 U.S. Healthcare reform
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the presidential administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The Depart of Health and Human Services, or HHS, plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.


The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Additional regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 Europe / rest of world government regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country in the European Union. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of a drug product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The documentation submitted to the FDA in support of an NDA in the United States is almost identical to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other regulations
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.


Human Capital Resources
 As of April 30, 2022, we had a total of 105 full-time employees, of whom 47 were located in the United States, 56 were located in the United Kingdom, and 2 were located in Switzerland. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, and we provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off.
