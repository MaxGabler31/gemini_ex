Overview
We are a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. We are developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, our system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate our ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits.
 Vaccines are one of the most successful and cost-effective global health interventions and prevent millions of deaths worldwide each year. Routine pediatric vaccinations are estimated to prevent 20 million cases of disease each year, saving over $180 billion in direct and societal costs in the United States alone. Adult vaccination rates are lower than pediatric vaccination rates, but new technologies are driving adult vaccine development, which in turn is fueling the growth of the overall vaccine market. Given the critical role vaccines play in preventing disease from childhood to adulthood, the global vaccine market is large, durable and growing. Nonetheless, there are areas of unmet medical need, including vaccines that can provide broader protection than currently marketed vaccines and novel vaccines that target pathogens for which there are no currently approved vaccines. We are driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked.
We carefully select our target disease areas and vaccine candidates based on the following criteria: areas of significant unmet medical need, well-defined commercial landscape and efficient market adoption, acceptable biological risk and established clinical pathways. We are leveraging our scalable cell-free protein synthesis platform to develop potentially superior and novel conjugate and protein vaccine candidates for adult and pediatric indications using these criteria.
Our pipeline includes:
 •Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, candidates that we believe are among the most broad-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the approximately $7 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Pneumococcal disease, or PD, is an infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, bacteria. It can result in invasive pneumococcal disease, or IPD, including meningitis and bacteremia, and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis.
 oOur lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of IPD and pneumonia. VAX-24 is intended to improve upon the standard-of-care PCV vaccines for both children and adults by covering the serotypes that are responsible for most of the residual pneumococcal disease currently in circulation. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for VAX-24 in adults. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study of VAX-24 in adults 18 to 64 years of age. We expect to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this Phase 1/2 clinical study by the end of 2022. The Phase 1 portion includes approximately 64 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age and the Phase 2 portion includes approximately 800 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age. Pending the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of this study, we expect to begin enrollment in a separate Phase 2 study in healthy adults aged 65 and older and to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study in the first half of 2023. We also anticipate submitting our first VAX-24 pediatric IND 


application to the FDA in the first half of 2023, subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and successful topline results from the VAX-24 Phase 1/2 study in adults 18 to 64 years of age.
 oOur second PCV candidate, VAX-XP, leverages our scalable and modular platform and builds on the technical proof-of-concept established by VAX-24 and is designed to expand the breadth of coverage to greater than 30 strains without compromising immunogenicity due to carrier suppression.
 •VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep, a pervasive disease that results in 700 million cases of illness annually, including pharyngitis, or strep throat, and certain severe invasive infections such as sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. There is currently no vaccine against Group A Strep, which is one of the leading infectious disease-related causes of death and disability worldwide. We believe we have demonstrated preclinical proof of concept for VAX-A1, the data for which were published in December 2020. We nominated the final vaccine candidate for VAX-A1 in the first quarter of 2021 and initiated IND-enabling activities in the second half of 2021.
 •VAX-PG, a novel protein vaccine candidate targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis, a chronic oral inflammatory disease affecting an estimated 65 million adults in the United States. We believe we have demonstrated preclinical proof of concept, the data for which was published in February 2019. We expect to nominate a final vaccine candidate for VAX-PG by the end of 2022. Our initial goal is to develop a therapeutic vaccine to slow or stop disease progression; however, the results from clinical trials may inform the potential adoption of prophylactic immunization.
 •We have other discovery-stage programs that leverage our cell-free protein synthesis platform, which, if proven successful in preclinical studies, could also be advanced into IND-enabling activities and clinical studies. 
 Our modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform, offer several advantages over conventional cell-based protein expression methods, which we believe enable us to generate superior, novel, more broad-spectrum and/or more immunogenic vaccines. In the context of conjugate vaccines, we believe we can add more antigenic strains without compromising the overall immune response. In particular, our ability to specify the attachment point of antigens, including polysaccharides, on protein carriers represents a significant improvement over the random conjugation that occurs with conventional technologies. This site-specific conjugation is designed to ensure that B-cell and/or T-cell epitopes are optimally exposed, maximizing the immune response, whereas random conjugation blocks these critical immunogenic epitopes, which dampens the immune response and may lead to a phenomenon known as carrier suppression.
We believe this precise control of conjugation chemistry enables us to design broader-spectrum conjugate vaccine candidates using carrier-sparing conjugates that use less protein carrier without sacrificing immunogenicity. We are also able to design novel conjugate vaccine candidates using standard amounts of protein carrier to generate heightened immunogenicity. Beyond conjugate vaccines, we believe we can also design novel protein vaccine candidates based on well-appreciated but highly complex antigens that currently cannot be made using conventional technologies to address diseases for which there are no available vaccines. In addition, our platform enables us to rapidly screen vaccine candidates, requiring less effort than conventional chemistry which allows us to produce and iterate conjugate candidates, thereby dramatically accelerating the development cycle of designing, producing and testing vaccine candidates.


Our Approach
To address areas of significant unmet medical need, we carefully select the disease areas we target and are developing vaccine candidates based on the following criteria:
•Well-defined commercial landscape and efficient market adoption: We select vaccine targets that are characterized by an established patient population and significant unmet medical need. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a PCV intended to improve upon the standard-of-care for both children and adults by covering the serotypes that are responsible for most of the residual pneumococcal disease currently in circulation without sacrificing immunogenicity. We believe that by providing the broadest coverage of serotypes for PCVs, as well as providing novel vaccines for diseases for which there are no currently approved vaccines, we can leverage the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and similar international advisory body recommendations to drive rapid and significant market adoption. 
 •Acceptable biological risk: We choose vaccine targets with well-understood mechanisms of action and strong precedents for positive preclinical study results that we believe will translate to positive clinical trial results. For example, conjugate vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness in both preclinical and clinical trials against a range of bacteria, including pneumococcus, meningococcus and Haemophilus influenza B. There is consistent evidence that antibodies directed against these bacteria are protective against their respective diseases. 
 •Established clinical pathways: We pursue vaccine targets that we believe have clear and established clinical development pathways in order to accelerate the potential time to market. For example, we believe that our PCVs could receive regulatory approval based on successful completion of clinical studies utilizing well-defined surrogate immune endpoints, consistent with how other PCVs have obtained regulatory approval in the past, rather than requiring clinical field efficacy studies. However, while there have been approvals granted for both PCVs and meningococcal conjugate vaccines based on surrogate immune endpoints rather than field efficacy studies, we will not be able to confirm this approach’s applicability for our PCVs until we complete our Phase 2 clinical development program. For our novel vaccine candidates, where we believe clinical field efficacy studies will be necessary, we select disease areas with high attack rates, such as Group A Strep, which may allow for more manageable study sizes. For novel protein-based therapeutic vaccine candidates, such as our periodontitis vaccine candidate, we select disease areas where we believe clinical efficacy may be evaluated based on disease progression rather than prevention, which could allow for smaller and faster trials relative to preventative vaccines. 
 Our Platform
We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform to develop potentially superior and novel conjugate and protein vaccine candidates for adult and pediatric indications using the above criteria by taking advantage of the following:
 •Site-Specific Conjugation. We are able to specify the attachment point of antigens, including polysaccharides, on protein carriers to ensure optimal exposure of B-cell and/or T-cell epitopes, thereby creating protein carriers designed to have enhanced potency. We believe this precise control of conjugation chemistry enables us to create broader-spectrum conjugate vaccine candidates using carrier-sparing conjugates that use less protein carrier without sacrificing immunogenicity. We are also able to design novel conjugate vaccine candidates using standard amounts of protein carrier to generate heightened immunogenicity.
 •Production of Novel Protein Vaccines. We can design novel protein vaccine candidates based on well-appreciated but highly complex antigens that currently cannot be made with conventional technologies to address diseases for which there are no available vaccines, and we believe we may be able to leverage our platform to rapidly respond to new or emerging pathogens. We can design 


and produce these “tough-to-make” antigens that conform to the target pathogens, thereby increasing the likelihood that the vaccine will elicit a protective immune response.
 •Speed, Flexibility and Scalability of the Discovery Engine. We are able to rapidly screen vaccine candidates and produce conjugates, thereby accelerating the process of making and testing vaccine candidates. Because cell viability is not required for cell-free protein synthesis, we can utilize a broader range of reaction conditions as we seek to optimize proteins. This flexibility enables us to develop novel vaccine candidates unachievable with current technologies. Furthermore, we believe our platform can scale linearly from discovery to commercial scale.
 Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leader in the vaccines industry by using our cell-free protein synthesis platform to develop superior and/or novel vaccines to prevent or treat serious infectious diseases. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advance VAX-24 through clinical development and regulatory approval. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, targets the pneumococcal vaccine market. We expect to advance VAX-24 along a well-understood clinical development pathway in an effort to obtain regulatory approval in adults and infants based on successful completion of clinical studies using previously established surrogate immune endpoints, potentially without the need to conduct a clinical field efficacy study, consistent with how other conjugate vaccines have obtained approval. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA cleared our IND application for VAX-24. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study of VAX-24 in adults 18 to 64 years of age. We expect to announce Phase 1/2 topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study by the end of 2022. Pending the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of this study, we expect to begin enrollment in a separate Phase 2 study in healthy adults aged 65 and older and to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study in the first half of 2023. Subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and successful topline results of the initial Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study in adults ages 18 to 64, we anticipate submitting a pediatric IND application to the FDA for VAX-24 in the first half of 2023. 
 •Advance VAX-XP through IND-enabling activities, clinical development and regulatory approval. Our second PCV candidate, VAX-XP, leverages our scalable and modular platform and builds on the technical proof of concept established by VAX-24 and is designed to expand the breadth of coverage to greater than 30 strains without compromising immunogenicity due to carrier suppression. We intend to advance VAX-XP to maximize the optionality for and value of our PCV franchise.
 •Establish scalable production of VAX-24 and VAX-XP. We believe high-quality and scalable manufacturing is critical to our long-term success. We have designed and developed a proprietary, scalable and portable manufacturing process that we believe can scale to supply clinical and commercial volumes of VAX-24 needed to serve both adult and pediatric populations. We have completed the production of Phase 1/2 clinical trial material for VAX-24 and are conducting Phase 3 optimization and commercial scale-up activities. We have access to substantial manufacturing resources through our contract manufacturer, Lonza, that we believe can facilitate an independent path to market. Moreover, our next-generation VAX-XP program will use the components and core manufacturing processes established for VAX-24. 
 •Create a long-lasting PCV franchise by offering the broadest-spectrum PCV available. The two leading pneumococcal vaccine franchises to date, Prevnar and Pneumovax 23, have generated over $100 billion in combined sales, have been on the market for over 40 years and 20 years, respectively, and can attribute their success to being the broadest-spectrum vaccines on the market. If approved, we believe VAX-24 may obtain an ACIP preferred recommendation and potentially replace both lesser-valent incumbents for pneumococcal disease prevention in both adult and pediatric populations because of its broader coverage. We designed VAX-24 to address the 24 pneumococcal strains covered by Prevnar and Pneumovax 23 that drive most pneumococcal disease 


today with the durable, boostable immune response of a conjugate vaccine. Further, we have designed VAX-XP to address these 24 strains plus additional epidemiologically significant emerging strains expected to cause increasing pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance in the future. With these broad-spectrum vaccine candidates, we believe we are well-positioned to obtain an ACIP preferred recommendation and potentially replace the current standard of care for pneumococcal disease prevention in both adult and pediatric populations, thereby creating a long-lasting PCV franchise.
 •Advance our novel vaccine candidates and leverage our platform to expand our pipeline. 
 oAdvance VAX-A1 through IND-enabling activities, clinical development and regulatory approval. VAX-A1 is designed to prevent Group A Strep, a pervasive disease that results in 700 million cases of illness each year and is one of the leading infectious disease-related causes of death and disability worldwide. Some of the most serious consequences of Group A Strep include flesh eating disease (necrotizing fasciitis) and invasive diseases such as sepsis and rheumatic heart disease. However, the majority of Group A Strep cases are pharyngitis, commonly known as strep throat. Pharyngitis is highly prevalent in school-age children and a significant source of antibiotic prescriptions, which further exacerbates the growing problem of antibiotic resistance globally. VAX-A1 is a conjugate vaccine candidate designed to confer broad protective immune responses against all subtypes of Group A Strep and be boostable to offer long-lasting protection from infection. We believe our data published in December 2020 demonstrated preclinical proof of concept for VAX-A1. We nominated the final vaccine candidate for VAX-A1 in the first quarter of 2021 and initiated IND-enabling activities in the second half of 2021. 
 oAdvance VAX-PG to final vaccine candidate nomination and IND-enabling activities, clinical development and regulatory approval. VAX-PG is our novel protein vaccine candidate which targets the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis, a chronic oral inflammatory disease affecting an estimated 65 million adults in the United States. Our initial goal is to develop a therapeutic vaccine to slow or stop disease progression; however, the results from clinical trials may inform the potential adoption of prophylactic immunization. We have established preclinical proof of concept for VAX-PG, and we expect to nominate a final vaccine candidate for VAX-PG by the end of 2022. 
 oLeverage our platform for other discovery stage programs. We are also able to leverage our platform as a discovery engine given our ability to uniquely create building blocks to construct potential novel conjugate and protein vaccine candidates, and we have other discovery-stage programs which leverage this platform. 
 •Continue to build a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have developed and are continuing to develop a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio related to vaccine applications, including manufacturing, formulation and process applications as well as protection for our specific vaccine candidates. We have rights to a robust portfolio of patents and patent applications related to the XpressCF platform through our exclusive license from Sutro Biopharma. We currently have an issued U.S. patent and multiple pending patent applications in the United States and internationally that cover vaccine formulations, protein-antigen conjugates, methods of making conjugate vaccines with various protein-antigen conjugates and other processes, enhancements of immunogenicity and methods of use. 
 

Our Pipeline
We have utilized our cell-free protein synthesis platform to generate a pipeline of vaccine candidates that we believe, if approved, may offer important advantages over existing vaccines or for which there are no vaccines available today. The following table summarizes our current pipeline:
Global Vaccine Market (Excluding COVID-19 Vaccines)
The global vaccine market, excluding COVID-19 vaccines, was approximately $41 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at an 10% CAGR to approximately $67 billion by 2026. The World Health Organization, or WHO, has reported that non-COVID vaccine revenues have grown at nearly twice the rate of therapeutic products over the last two decades. Conjugate vaccines, including PCVs, have historically represented the largest segment (approximately 39% in 2018) of the global non-COVID vaccine market. The Prevnar franchise, comprised of Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, was the highest selling vaccine product in the world in 2021, accounting for approximately 13% of global non-COVID vaccine sales.
The pediatric vaccine market is large and well-established in the United States and European Union and growing in emerging countries. The annual new birth cohort, which in the United States and Europe approached more than eight million in 2020, drives ongoing sales year after year. In the United States, once a new vaccine is approved by the FDA, the ACIP considers whether to recommend the use of the vaccine. New pediatric vaccines that receive a preferred recommendation from ACIP are nearly universally adopted by pediatricians and parents and are required by many schools, contributing to a national immunization rate for the diseases targeted by such vaccines of approximately 90%.
In addition, the adult vaccine market is currently undergoing rapid growth. Vaccination rates among adults have historically been lower and vary by disease, though strong initiatives are underway to increase awareness and utilization. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies estimate that 40,000 to 80,000 adults in the United States die annually of vaccine-preventable diseases, and hundreds of thousands more are hospitalized. In recent years, manufacturers have started developing more vaccines for the adult market, with Pfizer’s Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, Merck's Vaxneuvance and GlaxoSmithKline’s Shingrix each representing successful examples. Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23 generated annual sales of over $2 billion in the adult indication, and Shingrix, a vaccine for shingles (herpes zoster) debuted with over $1 billion in sales in 2018 as it replaced Merck’s incumbent vaccine, Zostavax, after receiving an ACIP preferred recommendation, and generated over $2.5 billion in sales in 2020.


The complex development and production processes of vaccines create a high barrier to entry and long product lifecycles. Four multinational companies—GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer and Sanofi—historically comprised approximately 75% of the global vaccine market. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of new entrants into the vaccines market, including multinational companies such as Johnson & Johnson, and emerging biopharmaceutical companies.

Pneumococcal Disease
Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria. It can result in IPD, including meningitis and bacteremia, and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis. The global incidence of pneumococcal disease is driven by emerging serotypes not covered by currently available vaccines. In the United States, approximately 900,000 people get pneumococcal pneumonia each year, which is estimated to result in approximately 400,000 hospitalizations and 28,000 deaths. Pneumococci also cause over 50% of all cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States. Antibiotics are used to treat pneumococcal disease, but some strains of the bacteria have developed resistance to treatments. The morbidity and mortality due to pneumococcal disease are highly significant, particularly for young children and older adults, underscoring the need for a more broad-spectrum vaccine.
Evolution of Pneumococcal Vaccines
There are currently two types of vaccines targeting pneumococcal disease—polysaccharide-only vaccines and polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines contain polysaccharide antigens, which induce antibodies (B-cell responses) that bind to a bacteria’s outer coating of polysaccharides and clear the bacteria. PCVs improve on polysaccharide vaccines by attaching, or conjugating, the polysaccharide antigen to a non-disease specific protein carrier. PCVs induce both an improved B-cell response and a T-cell response, resulting in a stronger and more durable immune response and longer-lasting protection, as compared to polysaccharide vaccines, which only induce a B-cell response.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide-Only Vaccines
Pneumovax 23, manufactured and marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., is the only pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine widely available. Pneumovax 23 is indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults and was first approved in the United States in 1977, at which time it contained 14 different strains of pneumococcal bacteria. In 1983, it was replaced by the current version containing 23 different strains. Pneumovax 23 is routinely administered to adults to provide protection against bacteremia and generates sales of over $900 million per year.
Polysaccharide vaccines induce a B-cell response only and do not induce a T-cell dependent immune response. In the absence of immunological memory responses, the resulting antibody responses are transient and cannot be boosted. Without the ability to provide long-lasting durable immunity, polysaccharide vaccines are not effective in children below two years of age. In addition, the antibody responses primarily consist of immunoglobulin M, or IgM, antibodies that, due to their size, are restricted to blood and are unable to penetrate into lung tissue to protect against pneumonia. Therefore, polysaccharide vaccines such as Pneumovax 23 are only thought to protect against blood-borne infections, such as bacteremia. Figure 1 below illustrates polysaccharide-induced T-cell independent antibody responses.
Figure 1.
   Graphics adapted from Strugnell et al, Understanding Modern Vaccines, Vol 1, Issue 1, 61-88.
 
Polysaccharide vaccines also interfere with optimal use of PCVs, as they create a hyporesponsive immune effect. In particular, absent T-cell inducement, polysaccharide vaccines actually clear the memory B-cells that are formed following primary immunization with a PCV, thereby eliminating the ability to boost with subsequent vaccination. This historically has been a significant drawback of vaccination in older adults, which consisted of the administration of a limited spectrum PCV followed by the administration of a polysaccharide vaccine. Despite these shortcomings, Pneumovax 23 historically has been widely used primarily to provide protection against circulating strains not contained in the currently available PCV. The current standard of care, which consists of the administration of either Prevnar 20 alone or Vaxneuvance followed by the administration of Pneumovax 23, continues to include the alternative of a polysaccharide vaccine.
 Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines
PCVs overcome the limitations of polysaccharide vaccines by conjugating the polysaccharide to a more immunogenic protein carrier containing T-cell epitopes. These T-cell epitopes provide CD4+ help, which is critical to the conversion of a traditional B-cell dependent immune response to a more robust combined B-cell and T-cell dependent immune response. The T-cell response causes immediate class switching of the B-cells from more rudimentary IgM antibodies prevalent with polysaccharide vaccines to more refined IgG antibodies. IgG antibodies are refined enough to penetrate into lung tissues to prevent pneumonia. Furthermore, as polysaccharide strands attach to multiple copies of the protein carrier, they create an inter-strand cross-linked matrix structure, which the immune system easily recognizes as foreign. The T-cell dependent immune response also generates memory B-cells that can be re-stimulated, creating a prime-boost immune response and enabling a more robust and durable immune response, enabling the use of PCVs in young children. Figure 2 below illustrates this immune response:
Figure 2.
 


The first PCV, Prevnar, was a 7-valent vaccine that was launched in the United States in 2000. It included purified capsular polysaccharides of seven serotypes of S. pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F), each of which was individually conjugated to a T-cell-epitope-containing, nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin known as CRM197 to produce seven separate conjugates. To obtain approval, a large field efficacy study was conducted that demonstrated the vaccine’s efficacy in infants. Efficacy correlated with serological immune endpoints, as measured by IgG titers (a measurement of concentration), and a seroconversion threshold (or reference antibody concentration) of protection was defined. Prevnar is credited with tremendous medical and commercial success, having dramatically reduced circulating disease in children. However, after a number of years of widespread use, IPD incidence caused by strains not contained in the vaccine started to opportunistically rise, a phenomenon called serotype replacement, which led to the need for a broader-spectrum version of the vaccine.
In the race to develop a broader-spectrum PCV than Prevnar, two vaccines were successfully developed: Synflorix, a 10-valent PCV from GlaxoSmithKline, and Prevnar 13, a 13-valent PCV from Wyeth (subsequently acquired by Pfizer). Based on its broader coverage of then-emerging strains, Prevnar 13 was adopted as the standard of care in the United States and Europe. Synflorix continues to be used primarily in emerging countries.
Prevnar 13 contains the seven serotypes originally included in Prevnar plus six more serotypes of S. pneumoniae (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A) and was approved and launched in the United States in 2010. Each polysaccharide is conjugated to CRM197 to produce 13 individual conjugates, which are mixed into a final vaccine formulation and then adsorbed to alum. In 2010, Prevnar 13 obtained FDA approval for the prevention of IPD in infants based on non-inferior IgG antibody responses relative to Prevnar, using the surrogate immune endpoints established by the prior Prevnar field efficacy study. While Prevnar 13 failed to achieve non-inferiority on two of the common seven strains relative to Prevnar, it was granted approval across all 13 strains. Upon receipt of the ACIP preferred recommendation, Prevnar 13 replaced Prevnar in the infant market as the standard of care. This also created a “catch-up” population for those children previously vaccinated with Prevnar to provide protection against the incremental serotypes covered by Prevnar 13.
Prevnar 13 has also received accelerated approval for the prevention of IPD and pneumonia in adults in the United States based on non-inferior opsonophagocytosis activity, or OPA, responses as compared to Pneumovax 23. To fulfill a post-marketing commitment, a large-scale field efficacy study of adults in the Netherlands was completed in 2013, which showed protection against community-acquired pneumonia and concordance between OPA and protection from community-acquired pneumonia. Thus, OPA was established as a validated surrogate immune endpoint in adults to support future regulatory approvals. Prevnar 13 subsequently received an ACIP preferred recommendation for adults 65 years and older, and the standard of care was amended to first vaccinate with Prevnar 13, and then after a waiting period, Pneumovax 23. This dual vaccine regimen provides some protection against the circulating strains over and above Prevnar 13 but we believe creates coverage gaps and patient compliance and convenience challenges.

Prevnar 13 quickly became the highest selling product in the global vaccine market. However, at the time of ACIP’s recommendation in 2014, it was determined that the recommendation would be revisited in four years to evaluate the impact of Prevnar 13 on pneumococcal disease burden in older adults. In June 2019, the ACIP downgraded its recommendation of Prevnar 13 for older adults, given the lack of disease caused by the incorporated strains, and instead began directing physicians and patients to decide whether to vaccinate on a case-by-case basis while still recommending universal vaccination with Pneumovax 23 due to its broader coverage.
  In an effort to develop even broader-spectrum PCVs than Prevnar 13, two vaccines were successfully developed for the adult population: Prevnar 20, a 20-valent PCV from Pfizer, and Vaxneuvance, a 15-valent PCV from Merck.
 Prevnar 20 contains the 13 serotypes included in Prevnar 13 plus seven more serotypes of S. pneumoniae (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) and was granted regulatory approval and launched in the United States in 2021 for the prevention of IPD in adults based on non-inferior OPA responses relative to Prevnar 13 without the need for a field efficacy study. While Prevnar 20 failed to achieve non-inferiority on serotype 8 relative to Pneumovax 23, it was still granted approval across all 20 strains.
 Vaxneuvance contains the 13 serotypes included in Prevnar 13 plus two more serotypes of S. pneumoniae (22F and 33F) and was granted regulatory approval and launched in the United States in 2021 for the prevention of IPD in adults based on non-inferior OPA responses relative to Prevnar 13 without the need for a field efficacy study.
 In October 2021, the ACIP voted to recommend universal vaccination for the use of either Prevnar 20 alone or Vaxneuvance with Pneumovax 23 for routine use in adults aged 65 years and older as well as for those between the ages of 19 and 64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors.
 Pfizer and Merck also are developing Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance, respectively, for infants.
 Drawbacks for Current PCVs
Routine immunization with PCVs has been effective in dramatically lowering the incidence of IPD in both adults and children in the United States and other industrialized nations. However, due to a phenomenon called serotype replacement, strains that are not covered by existing vaccines are increasing in prevalence. As published in 2020, over 71% of IPD incidence in 2017 for both children and adults was caused by strains beyond the 13 strains covered by Prevnar 13. Efforts to improve upon current standard of care vaccines center around expanding the valency of PCVs to address the strains driving residual pneumococcal disease. However, limitations due to conventional conjugation chemistry and carrier suppression have complicated those efforts, and notwithstanding the recent approvals of Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance, there remains a significant need for broader-spectrum PCVs, as evidenced by the fact that despite Prevnar 20’s broader coverage, the combination of Vaxneuvance and Pneumovax 23 remains universally recommended in adults, as an alternative to Prevnar 20 alone, given its broader-spectrum coverage.
While vaccination with current PCVs has been effective in dramatically lowering the incidence of IPD in both adults and children in the United States and other industrialized nations, current PCVs suffer from the following drawbacks.
Serotype Replacement
Current PCVs do not address circulating strains causing the majority of pneumococcal disease. Since its introduction, there has been a decrease in the incidence of disease attributable to the serotypes covered by Prevnar 13 but an increase in incidence attributable to the incremental 11 strains that now cause most residual disease. Such change is driven by the void created when serotypes are taken out of circulation after widespread vaccination, which is a phenomenon known as serotype replacement. As a result of such change, broader-spectrum PCVs are required to maintain protection against historically pathogenic strains while expanding coverage to address current circulating and emerging strains.

To date, the most comprehensive pneumococcal disease surveillance has been conducted by the CDC in the United States and by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, in the United Kingdom. As shown in Figure 3, IPD cases in adults in the United States initially declined after the introduction of Prevnar 13 but have since plateaued. As published in 2020, non-covered serotypes were responsible for over 71% of IPD incidence in 2017 for both children and adults. The rate of serotype replacement has been more pronounced in the United Kingdom. Figure 4 shows the approximate IPD incidence rates in the United Kingdom caused by the incremental 11 strains over and above those in Prevnar 13, which increased over the last three years of surveillance.

While these 11 strains are covered by Pneumovax 23, that vaccine only protects against blood-borne infections and not pneumonia, leaving patients vulnerable to infection. Although Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance address more disease-causing strains than Prevnar 13, we believe there remains a significant need for even broader-spectrum vaccines to address a greater number of currently circulating and emerging strains.
Carrier Suppression
Technical constraints inherent to conventional conjugation chemistry limit the coverage of current PCVs due to a phenomenon known as carrier suppression. In particular, traditional conjugation methods cannot control where conjugation of the polysaccharide occurs on the protein carrier. The protein carrier used in all versions of Prevnar is CRM197, a diphtheria toxin with a single point mutation rendering it non-toxic. The CRM197 protein contains 39 lysines, approximately 20% of which border relevant T-cell epitopes. Conventional conjugation chemistry randomly attaches the polysaccharide to any of the numerous lysines located on the protein carrier. When a polysaccharide is covalently bound to a protein carrier at a lysine residue that is co-resident with a T-cell epitope, it blocks the presentation of the T-cell epitope to the immune system, thus preventing the induction of a T-cell response. The masking of these critical epitopes prevents the conversion to a T-cell dependent immune response and negates the benefit of the protein carrier.
Meanwhile, the B-cell epitopes of both the protein carrier and the antigen are presented to the immune system, causing B-cells to the respective immunogens to compete with one another for the T-cell help engendered by unblocked T-cell epitopes. This competition for T-cell help diminishes the immune response to the polysaccharide antigen of interest, resulting in carrier suppression.
The result of carrier suppression is a decrease in the targeted immune response to the disease-specific polysaccharides, which intensifies with higher cumulative amounts of protein carrier. This phenomenon impedes the ability to expand coverage of current PCVs and has been shown consistently when broader-spectrum versions of conventional PCVs have been compared to lesser-valent versions. When Prevnar 13 was compared to Prevnar (Pfizer’s first generation 7-valent PCV) in a well-controlled Phase 3 study in infants, the IgG antibody responses

directed against the polysaccharides of interest for all seven of the common strains in each vaccine were lower for Prevnar 13 (Figure 5). In 2020, Pfizer presented results of a well-controlled Phase 3 study in adults, aged 60 and over, where they compared Prevnar 20 to Prevnar 13. In that study, the OPA responses directed against the polysaccharides of interest for all thirteen of the common strains in each vaccine were lower for the 20-valent development candidate (Figure 6).

 Conventional Chemistry
The problem of carrier suppression is compounded by conventional conjugation chemistry used to make current PCVs, including Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance, which requires a higher amount of CRM197 protein carrier than polysaccharide antigen to complete the conjugation reaction, as well as long reaction times and harsh conditions that can damage the critical epitopes on the polysaccharide antigens. This results in a higher ratio of protein carrier to polysaccharide antigen in their monovalent conjugates (approximately 1.1 on average), as well as a much higher amount of cumulative protein carrier in the final formulation compared to the amount of any given polysaccharide antigen. For example, in the marketed Prevnar 13 formulation, there are 34 micrograms of the protein carrier, CRM197, relative to 2.2 micrograms of each polysaccharide (except serotype 6B at 4.4 micrograms), and in the marketed Prevnar 20 formulation, there are 51 micrograms of CRM197 relative to 2.2 micrograms of each polysaccharide (except serotype 6B at 4.4 micrograms). With substantially more protein carrier in the vaccine than polysaccharide antigen, the carrier suppression effect discussed above is exacerbated.
Our Solution
We are leveraging our cell-free protein synthesis platform to develop potentially superior conjugate vaccines for adult and pediatric indications. Our solution to the drawbacks with conventional conjugate vaccine techniques represents the first of three main applications of our platform.
Platform Application One: Creating Superior Conjugate Vaccines
Using our cell-free protein synthesis platform, we are developing superior, novel PCVs designed to have broader-spectrum coverage in an effort to address current and future residual disease in ways that conventional technologies cannot. We are able to design our investigational PCVs using site-specific conjugation in an effort to ensure optimal exposure of targeted immunogenic T-cell epitopes on protein carriers. This enables us to create broader-spectrum conjugate vaccine candidates using carrier-sparing conjugates designed to avoid carrier suppression while maintaining protective immunogenicity.
Synthesizing proteins outside of a living host cell provides us greater freedom to design and produce specific proteins of interest under optimized conditions. We separate the precise cellular machinery required for transcription, translation and energy production—the critical components for protein production—into an
12


Escherichia coli (E. coli)-derived extract. We can then optimally express a single protein carrier by adding the plasmid-DNA encoding that protein into the extract mixture.
Site-Specific Conjugation
Within a protein carrier, we can substitute non-native amino acids, or nnAAs, for native amino acids at specific sites. These inserted nnAAs serve as conjugation anchors that permit the attachment of antigens, including polysaccharides, at a specific site on a protein carrier to ensure optimal exposure of B-cell and/or T-cell epitopes to induce the desired immune response. This precise site-specific linkage is not possible using conventional conjugation chemistry with conventional carrier proteins and affords an advantage to our conjugate vaccine candidates. Figure 7 below depicts our method of inserting nnAAs into a protein carrier, where the DNA sequence has been modified to permit nnAA incorporation into the protein at pre-selected sites using a nnAA-RNA permitting transcription and translation of the protein in the ribosome to yield the protein carrier with nnAAs site-specifically incorporated, facilitating site-specific conjugation.
Figure 7.


Most conjugate vaccines available today use a non-disease-specific protein carrier, CRM197, in order to leverage T-cell epitopes to induce a T-cell dependent immune response. This traditional method produces a heterogeneous mixture of conjugates with blocked and unblocked T-cell epitopes in a large immunogenic cross-linked matrix structure. In contrast, the precision and flexibility of cell-free protein expression, together with our ability to insert nnAAs, allow us to construct our proprietary enhanced protein carrier, or eCRM, with pre-determined conjugation sites. Our method produces homogenous conjugates that provide for the consistent exposure of T-cell epitopes and likewise form a large, immunogenic cross-linked matrix structure. By precisely conjugating polysaccharides to eCRM in a way that provides for optimal exposure of T-cell epitopes to the immune system, we can heighten immunogenicity attainable with conjugate vaccines.
The figures below illustrate the site-specific conjugation process. Figure 8 shows site-specific conjugation of the polysaccharide to the protein carrier, avoiding the T-cell epitopes. Figure 9 shows the inter-strand cross-linked matrix, which is the structure of each monovalent conjugate included in the final vaccine.

Figure 8. | Figure 9. 
Precise, Site-Specific Conjugation Sites on Proprietary eCRM Protein Carrier | Final VAX-24 Conjugates inCustomary Matrix Form

    We believe consistent exposure of T-cell epitopes should translate to higher potency of the protein carrier on a weight-to-weight basis. To harness this potential potency advantage, we have elected to construct conjugates with a lower ratio of protein carrier to polysaccharide than conventional PCVs. We have observed in animal models that despite having approximately half as much protein on average in each monovalent conjugate, VAX-24 had comparable immunogenicity relative to Prevnar 13 on a strain-by-strain basis. As a result, we believe we can incorporate more monovalent conjugates to create an even more broad-spectrum vaccine with less protein carrier per conjugate in order to minimize carrier suppression.
Better Chemistry
We also employ a rapid and less harsh chemistry method called copper-free click chemistry to site-specifically conjugate the polysaccharides to eCRM. We believe this distinctive technique is a better controlled, more efficient and faster method of conjugation relative to conventional chemistry used to make traditional PCVs. The click chemistry conjugation reaction is designed to cause less damage to the critical immunogenic epitopes on the protein carrier or the target antigen.
Our PCV Franchise
We are developing broad-spectrum investigational PCVs designed to minimize carrier suppression.
VAX-24
Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is designed to improve upon the standard of care by covering the additional strains that are responsible for the majority of residual pneumococcal disease currently in circulation. We achieved preclinical proof of concept for VAX-24 in 2017 by demonstrating that VAX-24 has the potential to protect against the pneumococcal strains collectively covered by Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23, which at the time we conducted our preclinical studies represented the standard of care, and showed the durable, boostable immune response of a conjugate vaccine. The incremental 11 strains covered by VAX-24 and not covered by Prevnar 13 are responsible for the majority of circulating invasive pneumococcal disease in both the United States and European Union and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis.
VAX-24 includes 24 purified capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F), each of which is conjugated to eCRM to produce 24 monovalent conjugates. These conjugates are mixed into a final vaccine formulation and then adsorbed to alum.
As shown in Figure 10 below, there are critical differences between VAX-24 and other currently available PCVs relating to the protein carrier, particularly the use of site-specific conjugation and the milder reaction conditions. We achieve site-specific conjugation through the insertion of multiple nnAAs, which is not possible with the conventional chemistry used for making other PCVs. The click chemistry we use for site-specific conjugation

may also minimize damage to the critical immunogenic epitopes on the protein carrier and the polysaccharides through milder and shorter reactions, while other PCVs use conventional chemistries that involve harsher and longer reaction conditions.
Figure 10.



Furthermore, VAX-24, as tested in preclinical studies, nearly doubles the serotype spectrum of coverage of Prevnar 13, yet contains a similar amount of protein carrier. We believe the resulting decreased carrier burden per conjugate of VAX-24 is critical for avoiding carrier suppression and producing broader-spectrum pneumococcal vaccines without sacrificing immunogenicity.

Where appropriate, we capitalize on the efficiencies of well-established clinical, manufacturing and regulatory precedents by leveraging conventional methods for the development of VAX-24. For example, our polysaccharide antigens are primarily made using conventional fermentation and purification techniques and activated through conventional methods. They are also labeled through conventional amination methods prior to being conjugated to eCRM. In addition, we use the same critical quality attribute assays for molecular weight and free polysaccharide that have served as the physicochemical measures of conjugates and also serve as predictors of their immunogenicity in vivo. We also use conventional IgG and OPA serological assays to gauge the immunogenicity of our conjugates, which have served as surrogate immunological endpoints in clinical studies that enabled the approval of Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance.
We have also leveraged the same animal models that were utilized in the development of approved PCVs. In particular, our preclinical studies utilized a recognized rabbit model that Pfizer used in its development of Prevnar, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, that Merck used in its development of Vaxneuvance and that GlaxoSmithKline used in its development of Synflorix. To date, the rabbit model has shown consistent immunological responsiveness across all strains for which we have tested our conjugates and has differentiated conjugated versus unconjugated polysaccharide responses (i.e., T-cell dependent versus T-cell independent responses). We believe the demonstration of conjugate-like immune responses in rabbits that resulted in killing of bacteria via OPA and induction of IgG antibody responses are key development milestones and are critical readouts for the development of PCVs. The rabbit model has also provided evidence regarding VAX-24’s potential to generate a booster response.
We expect to pursue a well-characterized clinical development path for VAX-24, consistent with other PCV developers. We anticipate that we will be able to conduct smaller and shorter clinical trials that target immune endpoints (e.g., OPA and IgG responses) previously recognized by regulatory authorities. Pfizer applied this approach to the development of Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20 and Merck applied it to the development of Vaxneuvance.
We conducted a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in December 2019 to obtain feedback on our VAX-24 chemistry, manufacturing and controls plan, or CMC plan, as well as our non-clinical and clinical design plans to support our IND application. On January 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA had cleared our IND application for

VAX-24. On February 23, 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical proof-of-concept study in adults ages 18 to 64. We expect to announce Phase 1/2 topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from this study by the end of 2022.
 Preclinical Data
As a prerequisite for regulatory approval, we believe that any investigational PCV will have to be compared to the current standard of care, which is currently Prevnar 13 in infants, and either Prevnar 20 alone or Vaxneuvance followed by Pneumovax 23 in adults. In the case of VAX-24, we believe a successful comparison would be based on demonstrating the clinical non-inferiority of the immune response to the 20 common serotypes in Prevnar 13, and the incremental 4 common strains in Pneumovax 23. To obtain pre-clinical proof of concept on our way to the clinic, we evaluated VAX-24 compared to the then standard of care, Prevnar 13, and assessed the comparative immune responses of VAX-24 using the same rabbit model utilized by other PCV developers. We dosed rabbits in our pre-clinical studies with 0.11µg, as measured by the amount of polysaccharide in each conjugate, for each of the 24 conjugates in VAX-24, as well as 0.11µg for the thirteen conjugates in Prevnar 13 (except serotype 6B at 0.22µg) and compared both PCVs immunogenically to each other and to Pneumovax 23, where each of the 23 polysaccharides were dosed at 1.1µg. The doses are representative of body weight differences in humans versus rabbits and roughly correspond to the dose differential between PCVs and polysaccharide-only vaccines. In humans, Prevnar 13 is dosed at 2.2µg per conjugate (except serotype 6B at 4.4µg) or approximately one-tenth the dose of Pneumovax 23, where each polysaccharide is dosed at 25µg. The species of rabbits used were approximately five percent of the average weight of humans in North America, thus 0.11µg approximates to the 2.2µg dose for PCVs and the 1.1µg dose approximates to the 25µg dose for Pneumovax 23.
We have completed multiple pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies of VAX-24 compared to Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23 in rabbits. The endpoints of the studies were to measure, on a serotype-specific basis, IgG antibody responses, the surrogate endpoint for pediatrics, and OPA responses, the surrogate endpoint for adults. Initial proof of concept was obtained with research-grade raw materials and conjugates made at Vaxcyte prior to initiating technology transfer to Lonza and production scale-up. In mid-2019, conjugates were made at Vaxcyte at small-scale using optimized processes and procedures using Lonza-produced raw materials, including our proprietary eCRM carrier and all 24 polysaccharides that had already been tech transferred and scaled up. All 24 of the conjugates in VAX-24 met the critical quality attributes and the combination vaccine was administered in the rabbit model per Figures 11, 12, and 13. The chart in Figure 12 reflects the strains covered by each of VAX-24, Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23 in these experiments.
Figure 11.




As reflected in Figure 12 below, VAX-24 showed comparable or superior OPA responses at 1/10th the dose of Pneumovax 23 and comparable OPA responses to an equivalent dose of Prevnar 13 on a serotype-by-serotype basis:
Figure 12.

Similarly, as reflected in Figure 13 below, VAX-24 showed superior IgG antibody responses at 1/10th the dose of Pneumovax 23 and comparable IgG responses to an equivalent dose of Prevnar 13 on a serotype-by-serotype basis:
Figure 13.

A critical milestone in product development is the scale-up of manufacturing to provide sufficient material for clinical evaluation and potential commercial launch. After having completed the technology transfer of the optimized processes and procedures for the production of each of the 24 conjugates in VAX-24, the conjugates were produced at Lonza at an over fifteen-fold scale increase to the prior scale at Vaxcyte. Each of the conjugates in

VAX-24 made at Lonza met the critical quality attributes and the combination vaccine was administered in the rabbit model. The chart in Figure 14 reflects the strains covered by each of VAX-24 and Prevnar 13 in this experiment.
Figure 14.


The data shown below in Figure 15 confirms that the eCRM and polysaccharide raw materials and the conjugation processes for each of the conjugates in VAX-24 all were transferred to and scaled at Lonza, and the immunogenicity remained comparable to Prevnar 13 and was consistent with prior lots of VAX-24.

VAX-24 Clinical Development Plan
To accelerate our time to market, we intend to first pursue clinical proof of concept in the United States for adults and then pursue clinical development in the pediatric population. We believe the most expedient path to clinical proof of concept will be in the adult population where the standard of care involves the administration of a single dose and where an initial clinical trial could begin in the target population. We expect to initiate our pediatric development program in toddlers upon receipt of the Phase 2 topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data in adults 50 to 64 years of age and following submission and clearance of an IND application for this population. After completing such a toddler study, we would expect to commence clinical development in the infant population.
Adult Indication
Our first-in-human study is a randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding, controlled Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy adults. The Phase 1 portion of the study will enroll approximately 64 healthy adults aged 18 to 49 to assess the safety and tolerability of each of three VAX-24 doses and compared to PCV20. Participants will be randomized equally in four separate arms and will be evaluated for safety 8 and 29 days after dosing. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels compared to that of Prevnar 20 in approximately 800 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age. Participants will be randomized equally in four separate arms and approximately 28 days after participants are dosed, samples are collected to assess immunogenicity. Topline data will be based on the results as of this one-month assessment, as well as the safety and tolerability observations throughout this period. All participants in the Phase 1/2 study will be followed for a total of 6 months after dosing to assess safety and tolerability.
 To date, our preclinical immunogenicity data suggest that VAX-24 will contain a lower overall polysaccharide to protein ratio of conjugated drug substance as compared to Prevnar 20 and depending on the dose-ranging study, the dose may contain lower cumulative protein as well. We initiated the Phase 1/2 study in February 2022 and expect to announce Phase 1/2 topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data by the end of 2022.
We expect to use OPA titers as the primary immunogenicity endpoint for the VAX-24 program in adults. OPA is believed to be the primary protective mechanism against pneumococcal disease. In addition, we expect to measure IgG responses as a secondary endpoint, as such responses may serve as supportive evidence of immunogenicity for comparison. We also expect to use OPA titers and IgG concentrations as endpoints in our other planned adult studies of VAX-24. We currently believe that these endpoints, if met, will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of VAX-24 and do not anticipate the need for a clinical field efficacy trial. However, we have not yet obtained feedback from the FDA regarding our pivotal Phase 3 clinical development plans or the acceptability of our approach.
The FDA has previously approved pneumococcal vaccines upon the establishment of non-inferiority based on a head-to-head comparison using established surrogate immune endpoints in the target population. For adults, Prevnar 13 was approved based on the establishment of non-inferiority of OPA responses relative to Pneumovax 23, on a strain-by-strain basis, where non-inferiority was defined as greater than or equal to 0.50 of the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the OPA geometric mean titer ratio. Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance were approved based on the same non-inferiority criterion but compared with Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23. We have designed our Phase 1/2 study to have greater than or equal to 85% power on an individual serotype-basis taking into account the serotype with the highest variability in order to show a two-fold difference between treatment groups.
 Figure 16 is a schematic of the overall study design of our planned Phase 1/2 study:
Figure 16.


If our Phase 2 trial is completed successfully, we expect to conduct an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and subsequently conduct pivotal Phase 3 trials in the adult population for the purposes of evaluating

non-inferiority to Prevnar 20 for immunogenicity, generating a sufficient safety database in adults and establishing consistency of manufacturing through a lot-to-lot consistency study. The Phase 3 non-inferiority results would then be used to seek approval of VAX-24 in the adult population. This approach is similar to the approaches utilized by Pfizer to develop Prevnar 20 and Merck to develop Vaxneuvance, where the immunogenicity of the investigational PCVs was compared to the 13-valent Prevnar product (current standard of care at the time).
Based on Pfizer’s experience with Prevnar 13, we believe that VAX-24, if approved, would have the potential to serve as a “catch-up” or booster for those who have previously received Pneumovax 23 or a lower-valent PCV. We believe a study exploring serial vaccination with Prevnar 20 and/or Pneumovax 23 followed by VAX-24 at different intervals could generate valuable data supporting a recommendation for VAX-24 vaccination in previously vaccinated adults.
To add to the body of data in adults, we plan to conduct a separate Phase 2 study, in adults 65 and older, upon the successful completion of the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 study in adults ages 18 to 64. The topline data from this study are anticipated in the first half of 2023.
Pediatric Indication
We are also developing VAX-24 as a pediatric vaccine. If successful, we expect the data from the adult Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials will inform the VAX-24 dose(s) to be evaluated in pediatric populations. We plan to initially evaluate VAX-24 in an age de-escalation study. The adult Phase 2 trial will provide the safety and immunogenicity data required to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study in toddlers which will examine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy toddlers aged 12 to 15 months. A dose of VAX-24 or Prevnar 13 would be administered to the 12 to 15-month age group. For trials in the United States, toddlers would be expected to have been primed with a 3-dose primary infant series of Prevnar 13. Immune response data would reveal whether the boost achieved with VAX-24 is comparable to Prevnar 13 for the common serotypes, with the remaining 11 serotypes to be assessed for a single-dose primary immune response in the toddler age group.
If our Phase 1 trial in toddlers is completed successfully, we would expect to initiate a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VAX-24 administered as a three-dose primary series to infants at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. We would also expect to give these infants a booster dose at 12 to 15 months for a complete four-dose series. The decision to incorporate dose-finding as part of this trial would be made based on data from ongoing or completed adult trials and the preliminary immunogenicity data generated in toddlers.
We plan to collect both IgG and OPA data to evaluate whether the immune responses observed in infants following vaccination with VAX-24 are similar to those seen with other PCVs. If dose-finding is performed in infants, the data would inform on the dose levels for each of the conjugates in the final VAX-24 infant formulation. Consistent with the approval process for Prevnar 13 in infants, we do not anticipate that a clinical field efficacy trial will be required for VAX-24 in the pediatric population. We expect the clinical development of VAX-24 to follow the same approach utilized for Prevnar 13, where vaccine effectiveness against IPD was inferred from immunologic correlates. In contrast to the adult population, VAX-24 approval in the pediatric population is expected to be based on a non-inferiority comparison of IgG responses to Prevnar 13. However, we have not yet obtained feedback from the FDA regarding our clinical development plans or the acceptability of our approach.
If our Phase 2 trials are completed successfully, we expect to conduct pivotal Phase 3 trials in the pediatric population that focus on evaluating non-inferiority to Prevnar 13 for immunogenicity and seroconversion or antibody concentration threshold; assessing U.S. routine vaccination responses following concomitant administration with VAX-24; and generating a sufficient safety database in infants. The Phase 3 non-inferiority results would then be used to seek approval of VAX-24 in the pediatric population. This approach is similar to the approach utilized to develop Prevnar 13, where the immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 was compared to the original 7-valent Prevnar product (standard of care at the time).
 PCVs, as well as all other polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines, have historically had an excellent safety profile, especially in comparison to other vaccines such as rotavirus and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis.
VAX-XP
VAX-XP is a franchise extension of VAX-24 that, if approved, would expand strain coverage to at least 30 strains and demonstrate the scalable and modular nature of conjugate vaccines we can develop. VAX-XP includes all of the strains contained in VAX-24 plus incremental strains that were selected based on the epidemiological evidence demonstrating their role in circulating IPD and is designed to protect against these emerging strains and to help address antibiotic resistance. The serotypes in VAX-XP cover over 90% of the circulating pneumococcal disease in the United States, although we are not disclosing the specific incremental strains at this time.
We have completed multiple preclinical proof-of-concept studies for VAX-XP in rabbit models compared to Prevnar 13, as well as more than 30 polysaccharides adsorbed onto alum. IgG responses in rabbits were superior to polysaccharide alone plus alum and comparable with Prevnar 13 in the common 13 strains. We recently completed the process of transferring and scaling the conjugation processes at Lonza for each of the incremental conjugates contained in VAX-XP over and above those contained in VAX-24. The data shown below in Figure 17 was generated using those conjugates produced at larger scale at Lonza and confirm that the eCRM and polysaccharide raw materials and the conjugation processes for each of the conjugates in VAX-XP demonstrate immunogenicity comparable to Prevnar 13 and superior to polysaccharide alone, consistent with prior lots of VAX-XP.

 Note: VAX-XP includes all 24 strains in VAX-24 and 7 additional pneumococcal conjugates. Serotypes A-G potential additional serotypes to be targeted by Vaxcyte under the VAX-XP program.

Platform Application Two: Novel Conjugate Vaccine Opportunities
We are also developing novel conjugate vaccine candidates for other diseases for which there are no existing vaccines. By leveraging our platform, we have been able to generate novel protein carriers with site-specific incorporation of nnAAs designed to provide optimal exposure of both B-cell and T-cell epitopes on the carrier. Using these novel protein carriers, we can produce highly stable conjugate vaccine candidates through site-specific conjugation of antigens, including polysaccharides. Functionally, one significant advantage of using carriers may be the additional protective immunity that the protein itself can provide beyond the conjugated antigen itself.
Group A Strep Disease Background and Market Opportunity
Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes or Group A Strep) causes a wide spectrum of both acute and chronic clinical conditions that lead to considerable burden globally. Group A Strep, a pervasive disease that results

in 700 million cases of illness each year, is one of the leading infectious disease-related causes of death and disability worldwide. An estimated 500,000 deaths globally result from Group A Strep, which is in line with the impact seen from the Measles, Rotavirus and Pertussis. Among older adults (≥ 65 years) in the United States, rates of invasive disease and deaths caused by Group A Strep have more than doubled over the last decade. Some of the most serious consequences of Group A Strep include flesh eating disease (necrotizing fasciitis) and invasive diseases such as sepsis and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Approximately 30 million people are currently affected by RHD worldwide. Importantly, the majority of Group A Strep infections lead to pharyngitis, commonly known as strep throat, which is highly prevalent in school-age children. In the United States, an estimated 17% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions dispensed to children aged 3 to 9 years are for the treatment of suspected Group A Strep infections. Studies have indicated that antibiotic resistance to Group A Strep has significantly increased over the past decade, leading the CDC to categorize Group A Strep as a concerning threat. Additionally, the development of vaccines against Group A Strep has become a priority for the WHO amid recognition of the rising disease incidence globally, as well as the need to combat avoidable antibiotic consumption.
It has been established that the repeated natural infection of children with Group A Strep results in immune responses that are protective against subsequent Group A Strep infection. We believe this observation justifies the development of a rationally designed vaccine for Group A Strep that is focused on conserved antigens expressed by all strains of the bacteria.
VAX-A1
We have developed a conjugate vaccine candidate, VAX-A1, designed to confer broad protection against subtypes of Group A Strep by virtue of polyrhamnose, a conserved polysaccharide, conjugated to Group A Strep specific immunogenic protein carrier using our site-specific conjugation technology. The resulting conjugate is designed to ensure optimal exposure of both the B-cell and T-cell epitopes on the protein carrier to confer robust, boostable and durable protective immune responses. We believe this single conjugate could potentially cover all Group A Strep strains. The vaccine is a combination of this novel protein-polysaccharide conjugate along with two additional conserved surface proteins.
Our initial preclinical proof-of-concept study was published in the journal Infectious Microbes & Diseases in December 2020. In the study, a novel protein and polysaccharide conjugate of the Group A Strep polysaccharide was constructed for inclusion in a universal subunit vaccine against infections by the pathogen. The VAX-A1 vaccine candidate, based on SpyAD-conjugated to a modified polyrhamnose backbone (lacking N-acetyl glucosamine) and including SLO and C5a peptidase, demonstrated protection from subcutaneous and systemic challenge in mice, antibody binding and opsonophagocytic killing for multiple Group A Strep M Protein Gene, or emm, types and no evidence of cross-reactivity to human heart and brain tissue antigens (Figure 18), which is a key leading indicator of vaccine safety. The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at the Division of Host-Microbe Systems and Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California, San Diego.
Figure 18.




Our VAX-A1 vaccine development program currently is funded in part by a grant obtained from CARB-X, a global non-profit partnership dedicated to accelerating antibacterial innovation to tackle the rising global threat of drug-resistant bacteria. The award committed initial funding of up to $1.6 million. In July 2020, the initial funding amount was amended from $1.6 million to $2.7 million and, if options to extend are exercised by CARB-X, up to $15.1 million in total funding available upon achievement of development milestones through Phase 1 human clinical trials. In April 2021, we received approval for the next phase of CARB-X development and executed the cost-reimbursement sub-award agreement with the Trustees of Boston University in August 2021. Pursuant to the agreement, the award committed additional funding of $3.2 million for IND-enabling activities and total potential funding of up to $29.7 million (including the current $3.2 million award and the prior $2.7 million award) upon the achievement of future VAX-A1 development milestones. In January 2022, CARB-X revised the parameters for the contribution of CARB-X funding and implemented maximum funding levels for all grant recipients. As a result, our total funding available upon achievement of development milestones through Phase 1 human clinical trials was revised from $29.7 million to $13.9 million.

We nominated the final vaccine candidate for our VAX-A1 program in the first quarter of 2021 and initiated IND-enabling activities in the second half of 2021. Upon completion of the preclinical development program and IND-enabling activities for VAX-A1, we intend to conduct a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 study in adults at risk for contracting Group A Strep infections. The primary objectives of the initial clinical trial will be to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary exploratory endpoints will be to measure IgG immune response to the vaccine antigens and to evaluate the ability of the antibodies produced in response to vaccination to inhibit and prevent infections caused by Group A Strep.
Platform Application Three: Protein Vaccine Opportunities
We believe we can also develop novel protein vaccine candidates constructed using “tough-to-make” protein antigens uniquely able to be expressed using the platform. In particular, the lack of a cellular membrane in our platform allows for the exogenous addition of components to manipulate transcription, translation and folding by modification of reaction conditions. Furthermore, removal of the typical restriction to maintain cell viability also creates unique avenues for optimizing and promoting protein production for antigens that might be cytotoxic to a cell-based system or require non-physiological conditions for optimal protein folding. Thus, utilizing these advantages, we believe we can express and purify important protein targets to generate unique candidates that are beyond the scope of traditional production systems. Our therapeutic periodontitis vaccine candidate is the first example of a “tough-to-make” protein-based vaccine.
Periodontitis Disease Background and Market Opportunity
Periodontal disease is a highly complex, chronic oral inflammatory disease that leads to the destruction of the soft and hard tissues supporting the teeth. The subgingival niche (below the gum margin of teeth) is populated by a diverse polymicrobial plaque. It is increasingly understood that the shift from periodontal health to disease is associated with changes in the microbial composition of the subgingival plaque, including activities of bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). The development of precise approaches to control this keystone pathogen, such as a vaccine, could then positively impact the periodontal disease burden.
Those with periodontitis also have an increased risk for heart attack, stroke and other serious cardiovascular events. In addition to gum and tooth disease, periodontal inflammation and infection with P. gingivalis have been linked to atherosclerotic heart disease mediated by P. gingivalis residing in atherosclerotic plaque. While we are focused on the treatment of periodontal disease with this vaccine candidate, if P. gingivalis is found to be causative in other chronic disorders, our vaccine candidate could potentially be a highly effective treatment and allow disease intervention at a much earlier stage of the disease. For example, recent research has suggested the potential for a link between P. gingivalis and Alzheimer’s disease.
Neither the natural host immune response nor currently available treatments are curative for periodontal disease. Existing treatment includes highly aggressive and invasive procedures, including scaling and root planing and surgical intervention, coupled with antibiotic use. Despite these types of aggressive treatments, diseased sites frequently progress, leading to tooth loss. Thus, the development of an effective vaccine for periodontitis would be highly desirable.

In the United States alone, an estimated 65 million adults suffer from periodontal disease. Globally, severe periodontal disease afflicts 10% to 15% of the adult population, resulting in productivity losses estimated at nearly $54 billion in 2010.
VAX-PG
We are developing a novel protein vaccine candidate, VAX-PG, targeting P. gingivalis that incorporates protein antigens that we believe are uniquely enabled with our technology. Our initial goal is to develop a therapeutic vaccine to slow or stop disease progression; however, the results from clinical trials may inform the potential adoption of prophylactic immunization.
VAX-PG, which includes cell-free produced P. gingivalis virulence factors, including gingipains, were tested in a preclinical model that mimics periodontal disease. The results, which we believe demonstrate preclinical proof of concept, were published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology in February 2019. The vaccine elicited protein-specific IgG response following immunization and protected mice from P. gingivalis-elicited oral bone loss. Shown in Figure 19 is the objective bone loss of VAX-PG with alum, Monophospholipid A, or no adjuvant. Immunization with all formulations of VAX-PG provided significant protection against oral bone loss compared to the no vaccine oral challenged control group (p<0.01, ANOVA with Dunns multiple comparisons).

 CEJ = cement-enamel junction
 

Shown below in Figure 20 are pictures of representative mouse jaws from the experiment. As can be seen, the vaccinated mice had considerably less bone loss than the unvaccinated and challenged control animals.
Figure 20.

   
We expect to nominate the final vaccine candidate for our VAX-PG program by the end of 2022. Upon completion of the preclinical development program and IND-enabling activities for VAX-PG, we intend to conduct a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 study in adults with mild to moderate chronic periodontal disease. The primary objectives of the initial clinical trial will be to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary exploratory endpoints will be to measure IgG immune response to the vaccine antigens and to evaluate the ability of the antibodies produced in response to vaccination to inhibit the formation of the poly-microbial biofilm, which is characteristic of periodontal disease.
Manufacturing and Supply
We have designed and developed a proprietary, scalable and portable manufacturing process for VAX-24 that we believe can scale to address clinical and commercial vaccine supply needed to serve both adult and pediatric populations. We have completed process development. technology transfer to Lonza and Phase 1/2 manufacture for the critical components of the VAX-24 conjugates. In addition, we have also completed manufacture, testing and release of the 24 drug substance conjugates and the final drug product for the VAX-24 Phase 1/2 study in adults. As we have completed clinical manufacturing, we are now progressing to commercial supply discussions. We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities, but our strategic partnership with Lonza provides us with access to substantial resources to facilitate an independent supply path to the market. Lonza is a leading global contract manufacturer with deep domain expertise and experience in large and small-scale production of clinical, as well as commercial-stage products. We have entered into agreements with Lonza to secure capacity, technical expertise and resources to support the production of VAX-24 clinical material and processes that are intended to scale to commercial scale at Lonza or other commercial manufacturing sites and are progressing to commercial supply discussions with Lonza. We have also entered into agreements for eCRM and polysaccharide to support VAX-XP to IND. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with Sutro Biopharma to supply us with extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing preclinical and certain clinical supply of vaccine compositions, and in December 2019, we exercised our right to require Sutro Biopharma to establish a second supplier for extract and custom reagents to support our anticipated clinical and commercial needs. We have completed the manufacturing process and the delivery of the clinical material to support the Phase 1/2 clinical studies of VAX-24

in adults. The conjugates in VAX-24 are designed to serve as the foundation for our next-generation VAX-XP program.
Process
The manufacturing process for our VAX-24 vaccine candidate consists of four key components: a) our proprietary eCRM protein carrier; b) the 24 pneumococcal polysaccharides; c) the 24 conjugate drug substances and d) the mixture of these 24 drug substances into the final drug product.
eCRM
Our proprietary eCRM protein carrier is produced using our cell-free protein synthesis platform. eCRM, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, contains multiple copies of non-native para azido-methyl-phenylalanine, or pAMF, amino acid. The pAMF amino acids have a specific structure that enables eCRM to participate in the site-specific click chemistry conjugation reaction with activated pneumococcal polysaccharides.
The cell-free reaction is performed in a manner analogous to traditional fermentation but without the cells. The first step in the production of eCRM is the manufacture of critical raw materials, namely E. coli extracts and lysates that contain the cellular machinery required for in vitro DNA transcription and translation. The eCRM protein is then manufactured by combining these E. coli extracts and lysates with classic media components such as amino acids, minerals and salts, with the in vitro reaction driven by the addition of plasmid DNA coding for the eCRM protein’s amino acid sequence. This cell-free reaction takes place in a standard fermenter, followed by standard protein purification chromatographic and filtration processes. The manufacturing process has consistently yielded a product of the desired quality.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharides
Each of the 24 pneumococcal polysaccharides are individually isolated from S. pneumoniae bacterial strains. Each individual S. pneumoniae strain is cultured in a bioreactor using a single standardized fed-batch bioreactor process and a single standardized downstream purification process. Overall, this standardized upstream and downstream process is simple and streamlined, thereby reducing manufacturing cost of goods and providing an efficient path of progression for the program from process characterization and validation through to commercialization, if our vaccine candidates are approved.
Conjugate Drug Substances
Each of the 24 conjugate drug substances is manufactured individually, as monovalent conjugates, by conjugating each of the 24 activated pneumococcal polysaccharide strains, one at a time, to the eCRM carrier protein.
Click chemistry provides for a conjugation reaction that is quick, consistent and high-yielding, and which we optimized to be largely standardized across the various polysaccharides. Through statistical design of experiment, or DoE, studies, we have gained a significant understanding of which variables to adjust to maximize product quality and, accordingly, immunogenicity in rabbit models.
VAX-24 PCV Drug Product
All 24 conjugate drug substances are mixed, formulated with appropriate excipients and adsorbed onto alum. Clinical doses are filled in vials and stored refrigerated.
Achievements to Date
In support of our IND application submission, we completed all IND-enabling CMC deliverables. For the eCRM protein carrier, we transferred process technology to Lonza and completed the development and scale-up to clinical production scale. We completed both the engineering campaign and the GMP production campaign for

eCRM to provide material believed to be adequate to support our Phase 1/2 clinical study of VAX-24 in adults. For the polysaccharide antigens, we established research and GMP master cell banks for all 24 pneumococcal serotypes in VAX-24. We completed the development and GMP batches of all 24 polysaccharide antigens to enable production of GMP conjugates for VAX-24. For the 24 drug substances, we conducted extensive design-of-experiments, or DoE, studies to define and optimize conjugation process parameters based on, among other parameters, immunogenicity and stability, for all 24 serotypes and transferred this process technology to Lonza. Further, Lonza implemented the transferred processes, successfully producing all 24 conjugates at an over fifteen-fold scale-up to what was previously produced. These conjugates met the target critical quality attributes, were tested in preclinical studies and confirmed to show conjugate-like immunological responses comparable to Prevnar 13 and to the previous VAX-24 conjugates produced at smaller batches. We completed the manufacture, testing and release of the 24 GMP drug substance conjugates in VAX-24 at Lonza. For the VAX-24 drug product, we defined an optimized formulation, transferred and scaled the process, and completed manufacture, testing and release of the VAX-24 GMP drug product at three dose strengths to support the IND application submission and the Phase 1/2 clinical study in adults.
 Lonza Agreements
In October 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement, as amended, with Lonza, or the Lonza DMSA, pursuant to which Lonza is obligated to perform manufacturing process development and the manufacture of components for VAX-24, including the polysaccharide antigens, our proprietary eCRM protein carrier and conjugated drug substances.
In September 2017, we and Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments for any stage that commenced after December 31, 2019 or had not been completed by December 31, 2019 until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2020. In March 2020, Lonza agreed to defer the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or April 30, 2021. In April 2021, Lonza further agreed to defer 50% of the completion payments until the earlier of the completion of all IND-enabling activities or December 31, 2021.
 In June 2018, we entered into a letter agreement, or the Lonza Letter Agreement, with Lonza, pursuant to which we agreed to certain terms for potential future payments in shares of our common stock as partial satisfaction of future obligations to Lonza. This agreement states that the initial pre-IND cash payments would be subject to a specified dollar cap, or the “Initial Cash Cap.” After the Initial Cash Cap has been reached, we would have the option to make any further pre-IND payments owed to Lonza in cash, in shares of our common stock at then market prevailing prices, or a combination of both, at our election. The Initial Cash Cap had not been reached as of December 31, 2020. As such, no amount had been recorded with respect to the potential future payments above the Initial Cash Cap at December 31, 2020. In April 2021, we reached the Initial Cash Cap and notified Lonza that we would be exercising our option to issue approximately $10.0 million in shares of our common stock as payment for a portion of pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021. In June 2021, we issued 399,680 shares of our common stock to Lonza at a price of $25.02 per share to pay for $10.0 million of the pre-IND payments due April 30, 2021.
 In October 2018, we entered into a second development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, or the Lonza 2018 DMSA, and together with the Lonza DMSA, the Lonza Agreements, pursuant to which Lonza is obligated to perform services including manufacturing process development and the manufacture and supply of VAX-24 finished drug product.
Under the Lonza Agreements, we will pay Lonza agreed-upon fees for its performance of manufacturing services and reimburse Lonza for its out-of-pocket costs associated with purchasing raw materials, plus a customary handling fee. Under each Lonza Agreement, we will own all right, title and interest in and to any and all Intellectual Property (as defined in each Lonza Agreement) that Lonza and/or its affiliates, the External Laboratories (as defined in each Lonza Agreement) or other contractors or agents of Lonza develops, conceives, invents, first reduces to practice or makes, solely or jointly with us or others, in the performance of the Services (as defined in each Lonza Agreement), to the extent such Intellectual Property (the New Customer Intellectual Property) is a direct derivative of or improvement to collectively the Product, Customer Materials, Customer Information and/or Customer Background Intellectual Property (all as defined in each Lonza Agreement). Lonza shall own all right, title and interest in Intellectual Property that Lonza and/or its Affiliates, the External Laboratories or other contractors or

agents of Lonza, solely or jointly with Customer, develops, conceives, invents or first reduces to practice or makes in the course of performance of the Services to the extent such Intellectual Property (New General Application Intellectual Property) (i) is reasonably capable of being used/applied to other projects and/or products in Lonza's or any third party process or (ii) is an improvement of, or direct derivative of, any Lonza Background Intellectual Property. Additionally, under each Lonza Agreement, Lonza grants us a non-exclusive, world-wide, fully paid-up, irrevocable, transferable license under all New General Application Intellectual Property, with the right to grant sublicenses, to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell and import VAX-24. We also grant Lonza a non-exclusive right to use New Customer Intellectual Property during the term of the agreement solely for the purposes of fulling its obligations to us.
We have the right, at our cost, to receive a technology transfer under each Lonza Agreement or have an approved third-party manufacturer receive a technology transfer of any manufacturing process developed by Lonza. For any technology transfer that includes transfer of Lonza’s Background Intellectual Property or Lonza Confidential Information (each as defined in the applicable Lonza agreement), we will be obligated to pay Lonza reasonable royalties and/or licensing fees.
Unless earlier terminated, each Lonza Agreement will remain in place for a period of five years. Either party has the right to terminate each Lonza Agreement upon a six-month notice period, provided that Lonza may not exercise such right until a specified future date. Either party has the right to terminate each Lonza Agreement if the other party commits a material breach under the applicable agreement and does not cure such breach within a given time period, for specified bankruptcy events or if a party receives a notice from the other party or otherwise becomes aware that a debarment, suspension, exclusion, sanction or declaration of ineligibility action has been brought against the other party, and we may terminate each Lonza Agreement for an extended force majeure event.
Competition
Historically, the global vaccine market has been highly concentrated among a small number of multinational pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer Inc., Merck, GlaxoSmithKline plc and Sanofi S.A. together controlled approximately 75% of the global vaccine market. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of new entrants to the vaccines market, including multinational companies such as Johnson & Johnson, and emerging biopharmaceutical companies. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions are also working towards new solutions given the continuing global unmet medical need.
 Within the current pneumococcal vaccine market, Pfizer, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have historically dominated, with Pfizer’s Prevnar 13, Merck’s Pneumovax 23 and GlaxoSmithKline’s Synflorix totaling a combined $6.7 billion in global pneumococcal vaccine sales in 2021 (approximately 79%, 14% and 7%, of such sales for these three products, respectively). While Prevnar 13 covers fewer pneumococcal strains than Pneumovax 23, it delivers a stronger and more durable immune response than Pneumovax 23. The current standard of care is Prevnar 13 in infants and, subsequent to the FDA approvals of Prevnar 20 and Vaxneuvance in adults in 2021, either Prevnar 20 alone or Vaxneuvance followed by Pneumovax 23 in adults. If approved, we believe VAX-24 may obtain an ACIP preferred recommendation and potentially replace both incumbents for pneumococcal disease prevention in both adult and pediatric populations because of its broader coverage.
Existing vaccine makers, as well as new entrants, are competing to develop the next generation of pneumococcal vaccines. Pfizer's Prevnar 20 was approved by the FDA in June 2021 for use in adults and Merck's Vaxneuvance was approved in July 2021 for use in adults. Sanofi and SK Chemicals have partnered to develop a 21-valent PCV. Separately, Affinivax and Astellas have partnered to develop an affinity-bound pneumococcal vaccine that includes 24 pneumococcal serotypes. We believe success will ultimately be based on the combination of immunogenicity, the broadest coverage of serotypes, safety and tolerability. Convenience and pricing may also be factors. Both Pfizer and Merck are in Phase 3 development in infants, and Affinivax has completed a Phase 2 study in adults. These vaccines may obtain FDA approval and commercially launch before VAX-24. However, if approved, we believe VAX-24 should compare favorably to these PCV candidates as a 24-valent alternative, based on our unique site-specific conjugation and carrier-sparing technology. We also believe VAX-XP has the potential to compete favorably in the PCV market based on its further expanded spectrum.

The competitive landscape for vaccine development for Group A Strep was dormant for more than three decades. However, the FDA lifted a 30-year ban on Group A Strep vaccine clinical trials in 2005, and research has slowly started to resurface in academic institutions. However, we are not aware of other Group A Strep vaccines in clinical development that would cover all strains of the bacteria. Additionally, we are not aware of any other vaccines under clinical development to treat periodontitis. We believe the success of our vaccine candidates in these areas will be based on potential efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience and pricing. We are aware of some companies developing treatments for other diseases that target the same underlying pathogens that cause Group A Strep and periodontitis. For example, Cortexyme is developing an Alzheimer’s treatment that targets P. gingivalis.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize vaccines that are safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or with a more favorable label than VAX-24, VAX-XP or any other vaccine we may develop. Many of the companies against which we compete have significantly greater financial resources, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do.
Intellectual Property
We have developed, and are continuing to develop, a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio related to vaccine applications, including manufacturing, formulation and process applications as well as protection for our specific vaccine candidates.
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our vaccine candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and vaccine candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our vaccine candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining the patent application or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our vaccine candidates.
Our patent portfolio as of December 31, 2021 contains approximately one issued U.S. patent, four pending U.S. patent applications and three pending patent cooperation treaty applications that are solely owned by us, as well as certain foreign counterparts of a subset of these patent applications in foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa and countries within the European Patent Convention and the Eurasian Patent Organization. For our pneumococcal vaccines, these applications are directed to vaccine formulations, protein-antigen conjugates, methods of making protein-antigen conjugates and the promotion of immunogenicity using the protein-antigen conjugates and vaccines. For our Group A Strep vaccine, these patent applications are directed to vaccine formulations, protein-antigen conjugates, vaccines and components thereof, as well as processes for their manufacture. For our periodontitis vaccine, the patent and applications relate to vaccine formulations, protein antigens, and methods of using the vaccine. If issued, the 20-year term expiration dates of our patents will expire between 2037 and 2041, not including any extension of the patent term that may be available in certain jurisdictions. We continue to seek to maximize the scope of our patent protection for all our programs.
In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain and are seeking both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered.

We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and vaccine candidates. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future vaccine candidates. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining the physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Obtaining patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents that could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our vaccine candidates. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States or other jurisdictions that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO or similar proceedings in other jurisdictions to determine the priority of invention.
Sutro Biopharma Agreements
Sutro Biopharma is a clinical stage, publicly traded drug discovery, development and manufacturing company using precise protein engineering and rational design (enabled by Sutro Biopharma’s proprietary XpressCF platform technology) to advance next-generation oncology therapeutics. Following our corporate formation, Vaxcyte acquired an exclusive license to Sutro Biopharma’s proprietary cell-free protein synthesis platform, XpressCF, for the discovery, development and sale of vaccines for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases, excluding cancer vaccines. Under a related supply agreement with Sutro Biopharma, we have an exclusive relationship in our field to buy extract and certain custom reagents for use in manufacturing the vaccine compositions covered by the exclusive license, which we use to produce our protein carriers and certain of our antigens. Sutro Biopharma will receive a 4% royalty on aggregate worldwide net sales of our vaccine products marketed for human health and a 2% royalty on such net sales of vaccines marketed for animal health.
Amended and Restated License Agreement with Sutro Biopharma
We are party to a license agreement with Sutro Biopharma, or the Sutro Biopharma License Agreement, which was originally entered into in October 2015.
Under that agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under Sutro Biopharma’s patents and know-how relating to XpressCF to research, develop, use, sell, offer for sale, export, import and otherwise exploit vaccine compositions for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases, excluding cancer vaccines, such rights being sublicenseable, and to manufacture, or have manufactured by an approved contract manufacturing organization, such vaccine compositions from extracts supplied by Sutro Biopharma pursuant to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement (as described below).
In consideration of the rights granted under the Sutro Biopharma License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a 4% royalty on worldwide aggregate annual net sales of our vaccine products for human health and a 2% royalty on such net sales of vaccine products for animal health use. Such royalty rates are subject to specified reductions, including standard reductions for third-party payments and for expiration of relevant patent claims. We are also obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma any royalties due to Stanford University (the upstream licensor of Sutro Biopharma), to the extent the royalties payable by Sutro Biopharma to Stanford University are greater than the royalties payable by us to Sutro Biopharma. Royalties are payable on a vaccine composition-by-vaccine composition and country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering such vaccine composition in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such vaccine composition. The latest expiration date of a licensed Sutro Biopharma patent application, if issued, would be 2036, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. In addition,

we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a percentage of net sublicensing revenue received in the low teen percentages. In addition, in the event we sublicense our non-manufacturing rights under the Sutro Biopharma License Agreement before a specified date, we are obligated to pay Sutro Biopharma a percentage, in the low double-digits, of the sublicensing revenue we receive under such agreement.
The Sutro Biopharma License Agreement will remain in effect until terminated. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party’s material breach uncured within 60 days’ notice, by us at will with 60 days’ notice, or by Sutro Biopharma if we challenge Sutro Biopharma’s patents or if we undergo a change of control with a specified competitor of Sutro Biopharma.
In connection with our formation and the entry into the Sutro License, we issued to Sutro Biopharma 1,778,304 shares of common stock, valued at a price per share of $0.002 per share.
Supply Agreement with Sutro Biopharma
We are party to a supply agreement with Sutro Biopharma, or the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement, which is dated May 2018 and pursuant to which we purchase from Sutro Biopharma extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing the non-clinical and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical supply of vaccine compositions utilizing the technology licensed under the Sutro License at prices not to exceed a specified percentage above Sutro Biopharma’s fully burdened manufacturing cost.
The Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement will remain in effect until the later of July 31, 2021, or the date the parties enter into and commence activities under a separate agreement for the supply of extract and custom reagents for use in manufacturing vaccine compositions for Phase 3 and commercial purposes. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement to extend the term to July 31, 2022. The Sutro Biopharma Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party’s material breach uncured within 60 days’ notice, by us at will with 60 days’ notice, or by mutual agreement of the parties. In December 2019, we exercised our right to require Sutro Biopharma to establish a second supplier for extract and custom reagents to support our anticipated clinical and commercial needs.
University of California, San Diego License Agreement
We are party to a license agreement with the University of California, San Diego, or the UCSD License, dated February 2019 whereby we are the exclusive licensee of an issued U.S. patent and pending U.S. patent application related to a non-cross-reactive Group A Strep carbohydrate antigen and methods of producing the antigen. We licensed this technology for the development of our Group A Strep vaccine candidate.
Upon execution of the UCSD License, we made an upfront payment of $10,000, and each year during the term we are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee in the single digit thousands. We are also obligated to pay UCSD up to approximately $1 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for each licensed product under the agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay UCSD a fixed royalty on net sales of licensed products in the low single digits. Such royalty rate is subject standard reductions for third-party payments. Royalties are payable until expiration of the last licensed patent. Additionally, in the event we sublicense commercial rights under the UCSD License, we are obligated to pay UCSD a percentage of all sublicensing revenue received, excluding any earned royalties or reimbursements of research and development expenses, of 20% up to a maximum of $2.5 million.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently develop, manufacture and sell licensed products and to achieve specified research and clinical development milestone events. If we are unable to meet our diligence obligations and do not agree with UCSD to modify such obligations or do not cure such obligations, then UCSD may terminate the license or convert the license to non-exclusive.
The UCSD License will remain in effect until the expiration of the last licensed patent. The UCSD patent and patent application, if issued, would expire in 2032, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term

that may be available in the United States. The UCSD License may be terminated by us at will with 90 days’ notice or by UCSD for our breach uncured within 90 days’ notice or if we challenge the licensed patents.
Other Partners
In addition to those listed above, we seek to partner with various academic, governmental and public or private research institutions as needed to advance the discovery or development of our vaccine candidates.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products in the United States will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product is typically separate from the process for setting the price of such a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. As a result, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that the reimbursement rate will be adequate. Certain ACA marketplace and other private payor plans are required to include coverage for certain preventative services, including vaccinations recommended by the ACIP without cost share obligations (i.e., co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance) for plan members. Children through 18 years of age without other health insurance coverage may be eligible to receive such vaccinations free-of-charge through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program. For Medicare beneficiaries, vaccines may be covered under either the Part B program or Part D depending on several criteria, including the type of vaccine and the beneficiary’s coverage eligibility. If our vaccine candidates, once approved, are covered only under the Part D program, physicians may be less willing to use our products because of the claims adjudication costs and time related to the claims adjudication process and collection of co-payments associated with the Part D program.
 Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As such, one third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Further, coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacture, quality control, approval, post-approval monitoring and reporting, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new biological product must be licensed by the FDA through the approval of a BLA, before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act. We expect our products to be regulated by the FDA as biologics and to be reviewed by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
We anticipate our vaccine candidates will require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.

The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, formulation studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be active before human clinical trial commencement; 
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before a clinical trial is commenced; 
 •completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent,” which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the products identify, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 •FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license, which is the approval necessary to market a vaccine. 
 Before conducting studies in humans, laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate, must be conducted. Preclinical toxicology studies in animals must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations.
The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, known as CMC, and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND application will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lend themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND application on clinical hold because of safety concerns about the vaccine candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND application. The IND application sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Submission of an IND application therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
All clinical trials for new drugs and biologics must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection, exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be

submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA within specified timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the vaccine candidate. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative and monitor the trial until completed.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, and different trials may be initiated with the same vaccine candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations.
•Phase 1: Clinical trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients or healthy volunteers, as appropriate. The vaccine candidate is initially tested for safety and immunogenicity. 
 •Phase 2: The vaccine candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND application safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects or any clinically relevant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND application safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the vaccine candidate, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the vaccine candidate for a proposed indication or indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual program user fees for approved products, can be substantial but are subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for

products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLAs within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLAs within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. Priority review will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions regarding approval.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. In most cases, the FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before specific manufacturing or other changes may be made to the approved product. As a condition of approval, the FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates under development.

Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, distribution requirements, complying with individual electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, specific manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Biologic manufacturers, their subcontractors and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Discovery of previously unknown problems, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal or suspension of an approval or license, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, consent decrees or civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or inpatient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict the manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of the investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after

completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product will also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform specific tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to an official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of the manufacture of the lot and the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform specific confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of its vaccine candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A fast track designated vaccine candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its vaccine candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the vaccine candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical

evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a product as a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation.
Even if a drug or biologic qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact and implementation of the BPCIA are subject to significant uncertainty.
United States Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there has been and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of vaccine candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the profitable sale of vaccine candidates.
Among policymakers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (2) created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (3) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in specific government healthcare programs; (4) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (5) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; (6) created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and (7) established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs.
There have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, was signed into law and included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on specific individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the "individual mandate" was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is also unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. However, it is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on specific product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
United States Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security laws and regulations and transparency laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring civil False Claims Act qui tam actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.


The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates and covered subcontractors who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Similar state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we expect to be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our vaccine candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a vaccine candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP

and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period.
To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area, or EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and 
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in the various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. 
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA, or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Additional Regulation
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, bacteria and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be

completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
Privacy and Data Protection Laws
We are also or may become subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and the protection of health-related and other personal information. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act.
European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. The EU GDPR allows EU member states to make new laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
  See the section titled “Risks Related to Government Regulation” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject to and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Employees & Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 89 full-time employees, 19 of whom have Ph.D. degrees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
