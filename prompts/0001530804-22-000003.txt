Item 1.    Business
Overview
Tronox is the world’s leading vertically integrated manufacturer of TiO2 pigment. We operate titanium-bearing mineral sand mines and beneficiation and smelting operations in Australia, South Africa and Brazil to produce feedstock materials that can be processed into TiO2 for pigment, high purity titanium chemicals, including titanium tetrachloride, and ultrafine TiO2 used in certain specialty applications. It is our long-term strategic goal to be vertically integrated and consume all our feedstock materials in our 9 TiO2 pigment facilities located in the United States, Australia, Brazil, UK, France, the Netherlands, China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ("KSA"). We believe that vertical integration is the best way to achieve our ultimate goal of delivering low cost, high-quality pigment to our approximately 1,200 TiO2 customers throughout the world. The mining, beneficiation and smelting of titanium bearing mineral sands also creates meaningful quantities of zircon and pig iron, which we also supply to customers around the world.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our ability to compete effectively in the TiO2 industry is determined by many factors, including innovation, reliability, product quality, customer service and price. The business processes that allows us to maximize the benefit of our vertical integration and global footprint --- the so-called “hidden factory” --- needs to be optimized if we are to successfully meet the pricing and other competitive pressures that characterize our industry. One of the largest investment projects that we continued to pursue in 2021 to improve our global business processes is what we call “Project newTRON,” a multi-year IT-enabled transformation program that includes both operational and business transformation. We believe that Project newTRON will not only enable us to maintain our position as among the lowest cost producers of TiO but also substantially improve the reliability, customer service, cybersecurity and the IT resiliency of our operations.
In terms of strengthening vertical integration, we have two significant mining projects currently underway. Most significant is the development of a mine in Eastern Australia called Atlas Campaspe. Atlas Campaspe is intended to replace feedstock supply from our existing Snapper / Ginkgo mines in Eastern Australia which are expected to be mined until at least 2023. Our pre-mining feasibility work indicates that this mine is abundant in natural rutile and high-value zircon, and will be a significant source of high grade ilmenite suitable for direct use, synthetic rutile production, or slag processing. In addition, we are investing in expanding our Fairbreeze and Namakwa mines in South Africa. Like Atlas Campaspe, we believe these expansions are extremely attractive mine development projects, rich in ilmenite, rutile and zircon that are expected to replace existing mines which would otherwise deplete in 2024 and 2025. We have numerous other mine development projects in earlier stages of development in Western Australia and on the Eastern and Western Capes of South Africa, all of which are intended to maintain or expand our level of feedstock vertical integration. 
Our vertical integration strategy may also benefit from the 2022 start-up of a titanium slag smelter facility (the “Slagger”) located in The Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries in KSA. On May 9, 2018, we entered into an Option Agreement with Advanced Metals Industries Cluster Company Limited (“AMIC”) which is owned equally by Tasnee and Cristal. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, AMIC granted us an option (the “Option”) to acquire 90% of a special purpose vehicle (the “SPV”) which will hold AMIC’s ownership in the Slagger. The Option may be exercised if the Slagger achieves certain production criteria related to sustained quality and tonnage of slag produced (the “Option Criteria”). Likewise, AMIC may require us to acquire the Slagger on the same terms if the Option Criteria are satisfied (the “Put”). If the Option Criteria are met and Cristal exercises the Put or we exercise the Option, AMIC will also contribute $322 million of AMIC indebtedness (the “AMIC Debt”) to the SPV before we acquire a 90% ownership in it. In addition, pursuant to the Option Agreement, we agreed to lend AMIC up to $125 million for capital expenditures and operational expenses intended to facilitate the start-up of the Slagger (the “Tronox Loans”). As of December 31, 2021, we have loaned AMIC $125 million to facilitate the startup of the Slagger. If the Option Criteria are met and Cristal exercises the Put or we exercise the Option, AMIC will also contribute the Tronox Loans to the SPV before we acquire a 90% ownership in it.
On May 13, 2020, we amended the Option Agreement (the "First Amendment") with AMIC to address circumstances in which the Option Criteria fail to be satisfied. Pursuant to the First Amendment, if the Option Criteria are not satisfied, Tronox has the right to acquire 90% of the SPV in exchange for the forgiveness of the Tronox Loans in which case the AMIC Debt will be retained by AMIC and not contributed to the SPV. 
Additionally, on May 13, 2020, we amended a Technical Services Agreement (the “Amended TSA”) that we had entered with AMIC on March 15, 2018 to supplement certain technical services that we had originally agreed to provide. Under the Amended TSA, we agreed to provide technical advice and project management services including supervision and management of third-party consultants intended to increase the likelihood that the Option Criteria are satisfied. AMIC and its consultants remain responsible for engineering and construction of the Slagger. As compensation for these services, Tronox receives a monthly management fee of approximately $1 million, subject to certain success incentives if and when the Slagger achieves the Option Criteria. The term of the Amended TSA was extended in December 2021 until December 31, 2022.
Capital Allocation and Global Debt Refinancing 
During 2021, we repaid approximately $745 million in debt and are on course to achieve our previously announced $2.5 billion gross debt objective well ahead of our 2023 target. Our anticipated strong free cashflow not only enabled us to accelerate our debt reduction program, but also enabled us to announce in November 2021, the authorization by our Board of Directors of up to $300 million of repurchases of our ordinary shares. At the same time, we also announced the Board's intention to increase the annual dividend to $0.50 per share. 
Further, in March 2021, we consummated a debt refinancing transaction which lowered our annualized cash interest by approximately $30 million and extended our debt portfolio’s weighted average years to maturity by approximately 3 years. The refinancing consisted of: (a) $1.3 billion first lien loan agreement due in 2028; (b) $350 million cash flow revolving credit facility; and (c) $1.075 billion 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2029, the proceeds of which were used to redeem approximately $1.065 billion of our then outstanding senior notes.

Exxaro Exit Transaction 
In the first quarter of 2021, Exxaro Resources Limited (“Exxaro”) sold its entire share ownership in Tronox, totaling 21,975,315 ordinary shares, in an underwritten secondary offering. As part of its exit transaction and as contemplated under the 2012 merger agreements between Exxaro and Tronox, Exxaro exchanged its 26% shareholding in our South African operating subsidiaries for 7,246,035 ordinary shares which were also sold by Exxaro as part of the underwritten offering. As a result, we now own 100% of our South African operating subsidiaries. 
Our Principal Products 
TiO2
TiO2 Pigment 
TiO2 pigment is used in a wide range of products due to its ability to impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity. TiO2 pigment is used extensively in the manufacture of paint and other coatings, plastics and paper, and in a wide range of other applications. Moreover, it is a critical component of everyday consumer applications due to its superior ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently relative to alternative white pigments and extenders. TiO2 pigment is considered to be a quality of life product. At present, it is our belief that there is no effective substitute for TiO2 pigment because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated as cost effectively. 
Ultrafine Specialty TiO2
We use the sulfate process at our manufacturing facility in Thann, France to produce ultrafine TiO2 products. We market ultrafine TiO2 products under the CristalActiv® trademark. Ultrafine TiO2 has highly catalytic properties due to the relatively high surface area of each TiO2 molecule. The principal use of ultrafine TiO2 products is in NOx emission control products utilized in stationary, mobile and marine applications. 
In 2021, we generated $2.8 billion in revenue from sales of TiO2.
Zircon
Zircon (ZrSiO4) is a co-product of mining mineral sands deposits for titanium feedstock. Zircon is primarily used as an additive in ceramic glazes, which makes the ceramic glaze more water, chemical and abrasion resistant. It is also used for the production of zirconium metal and zirconium chemicals, in refractories, as molding sand in foundries, and for TV screen glass, where it adds its structural stability at high temperatures and resistance to abrasive and corrosive conditions. Zircon typically represents a relatively low proportion of the in-situ heavy mineral sands deposits we mine, but has a relatively high value compared to other heavy mineral products. Refractories containing zircon are expensive and are only used in demanding, high-wear and corrosive applications in the glass, steel and cement industries. Foundry applications use zircon when casting articles of high quality and value where accurate sizing is crucial, such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and other high-end applications. 
In 2021, we generated $478 million in revenue from sales of zircon.
Feedstock and Other Products
High Purity Pig Iron
During the process of smelting ilmenite at our smelters to increase the concentration of titanium and produce titanium slag, high purity pig iron is produced as a co-product. High purity pig iron is used as a raw material in foundries for the production of high-quality ductile iron castings. Ductile iron is used extensively throughout the world for the production of safety critical automotive parts, such as engine blocks, brake calipers and steering knuckles in cars and trucks. 
Feedstock
Most TiO2 products are derived from three naturally occurring minerals which are commonly referred to as heavy minerals or mineral sands: ilmenite, leucoxene and rutile. Ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, as well as titanium slag and synthetic rutile which are processed from ilmenite, are the primary feedstock materials that we use for the production of TiO2 pigment. Titanium slag is produced by smelting ilmenite in an electric arc furnace to separate titanium-oxide from the iron and other impurities. Synthetic rutile is produced by reducing ilmenite in a rotary kiln, followed by leaching under various conditions to remove the metallic iron from the reduced ilmenite grains. The purpose of both processes is to increase the titanium concentration of the ilmenite. There is substantial overlap amongst each of the aforementioned with the primary differentiating factor being the level of titanium content.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For instance, rutile has the highest titanium dioxide content of approximately 94% to 96%, while ilmenite has the lowest of approximately 45% to 65%. As a result of expiration of external feedstock agreements entered into in connection with the regulatory approval of our Cristal transaction and our continued pursuit of our vertical integration strategy, we do not expect to actively sell feedstock going forward. 
Titanium Tetrachloride
We sell titanium tetrachloride (“TiCl4”) from our facilities in Thann, France and Yanbu, KSA. At our Thann facility in France, we produce TiCl4 dedicated for sale to customers for use mainly in the production of various types of pigments and catalyst products. At our Yanbu facility, we produce excess TiCl4 which we sell directly to a joint venture between Advanced Metal Industries Cluster and Toho Titanium Metal Co. Ltd. ("ATTM") for use at a titanium sponge plant facility that is adjacent to our Yanbu facility.
In 2021, we generated $301 million in revenue from the sale of high purity pig iron, feedstock, titanium tetrachloride and other products. This amount also includes revenue generated from the 8120 paper laminate grade to Venator Materials plc ("Venator"). In 2019, as part of the Cristal transaction and in order to obtain approval by regulators in the European Union, we sold the 8120 paper laminate grade to Venator and entered into a three-year transitional supply agreement which will terminate in April 2022. Revenue from 8120 paper laminate grade sales to Venator are included within Feedstock and Other products until the expiration date of the supply agreement with Venator.
The demand for certain of our products during a given year is subject to seasonal fluctuations. See “Risk Factors – 
Risks Relating to our Business - The markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns”.
Mining and Beneficiation of Mineral Sands Deposits 
Our current operational mining and beneficiation of mineral sands deposits are comprised of the following:
•KwaZulu-Natal (“KZN”) Sands operations located on the eastern coast of South Africa consisting of the Fairbreeze mine, a concentration plant, a mineral separation plant and two smelting furnaces that produce titanium slag;
•Our Namakwa Sands operations located on the western coast of South Africa consisting of the Namakwa mine, two concentration plants, a mineral separation plant, as well as two smelting furnaces that produce titanium slag; 
•Our Northern Operations complex in Western Australia consisting of the Cooljarloo dredge mine and floating heavy mineral concentration plant and the Chandala metallurgical site which includes a mineral separation plant and a synthetic rutile plant that produces synthetic rutile;
•Our Eastern Australia operations consisting of the Ginkgo and Snapper mines, a floating heavy mineral concentration plant at the Ginkgo site, and a mineral separation plant; 
•Our Perth Basin operations in Western Australia consisting of the Wonnerup mine and a mineral separation plant; and
•Our Paraiba, Brazil mining operations ceased during 2020 in line with our life of mine plan; however, we believe there is enough feedstock to supply the Brazil pigment plant through 2023. 
Zircon is often, but not always, found in mineral sands deposits containing ilmenite. It is extracted, alongside ilmenite and rutile, as part of the initial mineral sands beneficiation process. 
The mining of mineral sands deposits is conducted either “wet,” by dredging or hydraulic water jets, or “dry,” by using earth-moving equipment to excavate and transport the sands. The type of mining operation we deploy is dependent upon the characteristics of the ore body. Dredge mining is generally the favored method of mining mineral sands, provided that the ground conditions are suitable, water is readily available and the deposit is low in slime content. Dry mining techniques are generally preferred in situations involving hard ground, discontinuous ore bodies, small tonnage, high slimes contents and/or very high grades.
Regardless of the type of mining technique, the first step in the beneficiation process after the mineral sands have been mined is to utilize wet concentrator plants to produce a high grade of heavy mineral concentrate (typically approximately 90% to 98% heavy mineral content). Screened ore is first de-slimed, a process by which slimes are separated from larger particles of minerals, and then processed through a series of spiral separators that use gravity to separate the heavy mineral sands from lighter materials, such as quartz. Residue from the concentration process is pumped back into either the open pits or slimes dams for rehabilitation and water recovery. 
After producing heavy mineral concentrate in our wet concentrator plants, we separate the non-magnetic (zircon and rutile) and magnetic (ilmenite) fractions utilizing a variety of techniques. Through the separation process, we produce zircon which is sold directly to customers and rutile and leuxocene which can immediately be used as feedstock material to make TiO2 pigment or sold to the titanium metal, welding and other industries.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Ilmenite is generally further refined for use in our TiO2 pigment manufacturing processes. Depending on the characteristics of the ilmenite we use two fundamental processes to refine ilmenite. Both processes involve the removal of iron and other non-titanium material.
•Titanium slag is made by smelting ilmenite in an electric arc furnace to separate titanium-oxide from the iron and other impurities. The result is two products: “slag” which contains 86% to 89% titanium dioxide and is considered a TiO2 feedstock material, and high purity pig iron which is ready for sale to end-use customers. 
•Synthetic rutile is made by reducing ilmenite in a rotary kiln, followed by leaching under various conditions to remove the iron from the reduced ilmenite grains. Activated carbon is a byproduct of this process. Our synthetic rutile has a titanium dioxide content of approximately 89% to 92% and is also considered a TiO2 feedstock material.
Our current mining and beneficiation operations have an annual production capacity of approximately 832,000 metric tons (“MT”) of titanium feedstock, which is comprised of 182,000 MT of rutile and leucoxene, 240,000 MT of synthetic rutile and 410,000 MT of titanium slag. We currently have the capability to produce approximately 297,000 MT of zircon and 250,000 MT of pig iron.
Competitive Conditions of Mining and Feedstock Production
Globally, there are a large number of mining companies that mine mineral sand deposits containing ilmenite, as well as zircon. However, there is a smaller number of mining companies that are also involved in upgrading the underlying ilmenite to produce feedstock typically utilized by TiO2 producers. 
Pigment producers procure a range of types of feedstocks from multiple feedstock producers to create varying blends of feedstock materials that maximize the efficiency and economic returns of their unique production technique under conditions applicable at the time of production. Pigment producers frequently switch the relative amount of each feedstock they procure based on a number of factors including: the relative cost of feedstocks, feedstock logistics costs, the cost of, and availability of, chemicals used to process feedstocks, as well as waste management costs. Hence, there is a high degree of substitutability between and among titanium feedstocks.
Production of TiO2 Pigment
TiO2 pigment is produced using a combination of processes involving the manufacture of base pigment particles through either the chloride or sulfate process followed by surface treatment, drying and milling (collectively known as finishing). Currently, approximately 87% of our TiO2 pigment production capacity is produced using the chloride process and approximately 13% of our TiO2 production capacity is produced using the sulfate process. 
In the chloride process, feedstock (slag, synthetic rutile, natural rutile or ilmenite ores) are reacted with chlorine (the chlorination step) and carbon to form TiCl4 in a continuous fluid bed reactor. Purification of TiCl4 to remove impurities is accomplished using selective condensation and distillation processes. The purified TiCl4 is then oxidized in a vapor phase form to produce raw pigment particles and chlorine gas. The latter is recycled back to the chlorination step for reuse. Raw pigment is then typically slurried with water and dispersants prior to entering the finishing step. Due to the nature of the production process, the final pigment product is not sensitive to the feedstocks used to create it, as substantially all substances other than TiO2 are removed during the process. The chloride process currently accounts for substantially all of the industry-wide TiO2 production capacity in North America, and approximately 43% of industry-wide capacity globally.
In the sulfate process, ilmenite and/or slag are dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid. After removing impurities, dissolved titanium is hydrolyzed and separated from the remaining sulfuric acid. The titanium hydrolysate is subsequently calcined in a rotary kiln to produce a raw TiO2. The product is then further finished in a similar way to TiO2 produced through the chloride process.
Commercial production of TiO2 pigment results in one of two different crystal forms: rutile, which is manufactured using either the chloride process or the sulfate process, or anatase, which is only produced using the sulfate process. Rutile TiO2 is preferred over anatase TiO2 for many of the largest end-use applications, such as coatings and plastics, because its higher refractive index imparts better hiding power at lower quantities than the anatase crystal form and it is more suitable for outdoor use because it is more durable. Rutile TiO2 can be produced using either the chloride process or the sulfate process.
The primary raw materials used in the production of chloride TiO2 pigment include titanium feedstock, chlorine and coke. As discussed above, we believe we are unique in the degree to which we produce our own high-grade titanium feedstock. Other chemicals used in the production of TiO2 are purchased from various companies under short and long-term supply contracts. In

the past, we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we enter into the near term, to meet our requirements over the next several years.
Marketing of TiO2
We supply and market TiO2 under the brand name TIONA® and CristalActiv® to approximately 1,200 customers in approximately 120 countries, including market leaders in each of the key end-use markets for TiO2, and we have supplied each of our top ten customers with TiO2 for more than 10 years. In 2018, we launched a margin stabilization program which provides relative certainty over availability of product and price stability to customers who choose to participate. In early 2021, we initiated a long-term partnership strategy that we believe will strengthen the commitments from our customers across all regions and products. The long-term partnership strategy and margin stabilization programs are key parts of our TiO2 marketing and sales strategy, enabling us to focus on predictability and reliability of TiO2 delivery across the supply and demand cycle. 
The following sets forth the percentage of our TiO2 sales volume by end-use market for the year ended December 31, 2021:
In addition to price and product quality, we compete on the basis of technical support and customer service. We sell our products through both a direct sales force and third-party agents and distributors. Our direct sales, marketing and technical service organizations execute our sales and marketing strategy on a global basis. Due to the technical requirements of TiO2 applications, our technical service organization and direct sales offices are supported by a regional customer service staff located in each of our major geographic markets.
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on aligning ourselves with customers growing faster than the market and effective customer management through the development and maintenance of strong relationships. We develop customer relationships and manage customer contact across multiple contact points within the organization including our sales, technical service and marketing, research and development, and customer service teams. These primary points of contact are supplemented by direct contact with plant operations personnel, supply chain specialists, and senior management. We believe that multiple points of customer contact facilitate efficient problem solving, supply chain support, formula optimization and co-development of products.
Competitive Conditions of TiO2 Pigment
The global market in which our TiO2 pigment business operates is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality and service. We face competition from both chloride process pigment producers and sulfate process pigment producers. Moreover, because transportation costs are minor relative to the cost of our product, there is also competition between products produced in one region versus products produced in another region.
7


TABLE OF CONTENTS

We face competition from global competitors with headquarters in Europe, the United States and China, including Chemours, LB Group, Venator, Kronos Worldwide Inc., and INEOS. In addition, we compete with numerous regional producers particularly in Eastern Europe and China.
Research and Development 
We have research and development facilities that aim to develop new products, service our products, and focus on applied research and development of both new and existing processes. We utilize a third party for research and development support with respect to our mineral sands business located in South Africa and Australia. The majority of scientists supporting our TiO2 pigment product development and testing are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA and Stallingborough, UK, while the majority of scientists supporting our TiO2 ultrafine specialty business are located in Thann, France. 
New process developments are focused on increased throughput, efficiency gains and general processing-related improvements for our customers. Ongoing development of process technology contributes to cost reduction, enhanced production flexibility, increased capacity, and improved consistency of product quality. In 2021, our product development and commercialization efforts successfully produced a new coatings product at our Bahia TiO2 pigment plant as well as expanded the number of product grades produced at our Yanbu site. We also advanced product development for the plastics industry which is expected to result in increased growth in that segment commencing in 2022. In addition, our specialty chemicals and materials development efforts have been focused on producing products that we believe will benefit the environment.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Protection of our proprietary intellectual property is important to our business. At December 31, 2021, we held 108 patents and 5 patent applications in the U.S., and approximately 656 in foreign counterparts, including both issued patents and pending patent applications. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging through 2037. Additionally, we have 9 trademark registrations in the U.S. and 2 trademark applications in the U.S., as well as 272 trademark counterpart registrations and applications in foreign jurisdictions.
We also rely upon our unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets. The substantial majority of our patents and trade secrets relate to our chloride products, surface treatments, chlorination expertise, and oxidation process technology, and this proprietary chloride production technology is an important part of our overall technology position. However, much of the fundamental intellectual property associated with both chloride and sulfate pigment production is no longer subject to patent protection. At Namakwa Sands, we rely on intellectual property for our smelting technology, which was granted to us in perpetuity by Anglo American South Africa Limited for use on a worldwide basis, pursuant to a non-exclusive license. 
While certain of our patents relating to our products and production processes are important to our long-term success, more important is the operational knowledge we possess. We also use and rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. We conduct research activities and protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures. We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell, and have developed value in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks. See “Risk Factors—If our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property, our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, third parties may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights which could result in costly litigation."
Human Capital
Tronox employs approximately 6,500 people across six continents, and we believe it is our rich diversity and exceptional operational and technical expertise that, combined with our vertical integration model, position Tronox as the world's leading vertically integrated manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigment. Recognizing the importance of our human capital, we have made People, Culture and Capabilities one of our five strategic pillars, and placed a priority around developing leaders who will help us effectively (i) acquire, develop and nurture our talent, and (ii) foster a culture that embodies the values that are important to us, starting with safety and operating our business responsibly.
People
Because we operate both titanium ore mines and titanium dioxide pigment plants, and because our operations span the world, we require specialty skills in mining and TiO2 pigment manufacturing. We also need people who are willing to learn skills across both mining and chemicals operations and who can help us extract value from our integrated model. The below map sets forth the approximate number of employees as of December 31, 2021, in each of the global regions in which we operate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Accordingly, we place a high priority on knowledge transfer (including by relocating skilled leaders across countries and between mining and TiO2 pigment operations, by staffing high-potential employees in regions on global projects, and by enabling collaboration in global centers of excellence), and we place a high priority on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion. We are committed to creating an organization where leaders encourage a diverse workforce, where people feel valued and respected, have access to opportunities, and in which a variety of different voices are encouraged and heard. For instance, during 2021, we implemented a Diversity and Inclusion steering committee and developed a Diversity and Inclusion strategy consisting of three mission drivers: Workforce Reflective of our Communities, Foster an Inclusive Culture, and Develop our Diverse Talent. Moreover, in 2021, we launched a Women in Leadership Program consisting of female leaders across our company. 
We also place an uncompromising focus on operating safe, reliable, and responsible facilities, and we measure our progress with both safety metrics and leading indicators. We believe every employee and contractor has a responsibility for safety, and we proactively identify and manage risk, conduct ourselves responsibly, exercise good judgement, and take accountability for our actions. In 2021, our employees worked more than 12 million hours with 22 recordable injuries and no fatalities from our operations, and our contractors worked more than 8 million hours with 20 recordable injuries and no fatalities from our operations. For the tenth year in a row our aggregate employee plus contractor total recordable injury rate was lower than the prior year.
As we continue to navigate the dynamic COVID-19 environment, we continue to take swift actions in response to the pandemic to protect our employees, Tronox carefully monitored the impacts to our operations. We were able to operate globally without material disruption. We put prudent and proportionate measures in place, such as restricted employee travel, remote working, staggered shifts, wellness checkpoints at our entrances, visitor restrictions and more robust sanitation, and disinfecting procedures. 
Culture
We aim to create an organizational culture where employees unleash their full value through living our values, and fostering a high-performance culture. We apply an "outward mindset" by which we mean that each employee should be highly aware of the organization's goals and how his or her individual actions affect the entire organization. 
Nearly all of our employees have been through training and development courses which instill the principles of working with an outward mindset. The consistent training and reinforcement of the importance of acting with an outward mindset has enabled us to transform our culture. We believe this cultural transformation is reflected in our results, starting with safety: our people truly care for one another, and not only other employees, but also our contractors, visitors and communities. Shaped by an outward mindset, our people have embraced our global diversity and are naturally inclusive. 
Today, we are a collaborative group of people who naturally want to be helpful to others, and we adjust our own efforts to make our colleagues’ work easier, however we can. 
Building on the foundation of applying an outward mindset, we have adopted a set of core values that describes our expectations of one another, starting with safety. Every performance review starts with a self-assessment and manager’s assessment of our consistency in living our values. Employees are encouraged – and provided a toolkit – to develop in the values where they are weak, and to help coach others in the values where they are strong.

Capabilities
Developing the operating and technical skills of our people, and the leadership competencies of our leaders, is an essential component of our business strategy.
At the beginning of 2020 we assessed the competencies of our senior leaders on ten dimensions, and then identified a competency on which they would focus their development during the year. Leaders were encouraged to access targeted executive education courses that aligned with their development from a new online program we offered. During 2021, in addition to our senior leaders, our managers were also assessed on their leadership competencies and a competency was identified for development in 2022.
In addition to our focus on leadership development, we continued to leverage and enhance our employees learning through the following initiatives:
•Offered online education to all employees via a broad based global learning platform, providing leadership development, business skills and information technology; and
•Created development plans for prioritized technical areas based on gaps identified from a comprehensive skills assessment.
In addition, our employees are further guided by our code of conduct and business ethics and we conduct annual global training to help them fully understand and comply with our code of conduct.
We also have a rigorous succession planning process with respect to key positions throughout the organization. We believe such process allows us to proactively develop the talent of the future and allows us to move with speed and agility when leadership changes are required, as was demonstrated in the recent appointment of our co-CEOs and the election of our Chairman of the Board of Directors. As part of the succession planning process, high potential leaders are identified and development plans are completed for each candidate. 
Sustainability 
Our business requires an unwavering focus on sustainable operating practices, and our commitment to sustainability supports our overall vision and strategy to be the world’s leading vertically integrated TiO2 producer. As such, we integrate sustainability into every aspect of our business—from our culture and our strategy to our operating practices. We believe sustainable operations enable us to better control costs and manage our environmental footprint. In addition, we enhanced oversight of ESG by reorganizing the Board committee structure to make the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee with a restated committee charter that requires management to regularly report on key ESG initiatives. Sustainability also encompasses providing our employees with a safe, diverse workplace and offering them opportunities to grow and develop. Ultimately, safe, environmentally sustainable operations demonstrates our respect for our communities and supports our continued privilege to operate.
During 2021, we received a Platinum Rating by EcoVadis in recognition of our sustainability efforts. This Platinum Rating places us in the Top 1% of the 85,000 companies evaluated around the world by EcoVadis on their sustainability performance, and the Top 2% in the Basic Chemicals Manufacturing sector. The EcoVadis assessment focuses on four themes: the environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. In 2021, we achieved a 10-point increase in all categories, and a 20-point increase in the environmental category compared to our score in 2020.

Environmental, Health and Safety Authorizations
Mining
Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, but particularly South Africa and Australia. These regulations include those relating to mine rehabilitation, liability provision, water management, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and occupational health and safety. The various legislation and regulations are subject to a number of internal and external audits. We believe our mineral sands operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with existing health, safety and environmental legislation and regulations.
Regulation of the Mining Industry in South Africa
The South African mining regulatory regime is comprehensive and requires regular reporting to applicable government departments. A failure to, among other things, comply with any such reporting requirements or the conditions of any mining license could result in extended mandatory shutdown periods, license and/or mining right suspensions or revocations all of which could impact our business. 
In South Africa, the primary legislative enactments with which our mines are required to comply are the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (“MPRDA”) which governs the acquisition and retention of prospecting and mining rights. In addition, the Mine Health and Safety Act governs the manner in which mining must be conducted from a health and safety perspective, while the National Environmental Management Act (and its subsidiary legislation) provides the underlying framework with respect to environmental rules and regulation for which our operations must comply. For additional details regarding other South African legislative enactments that govern our mining licenses please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Regulation of the Mining Industry in Australia 
Each Australian state and territory has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and mining of minerals. Our key exploration and mining operations are regulated by the Mining Act 1978 (WA), the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) and their related regulations.
In Western Australia, State Agreements are contracts between the State and the proponents of major resources projects within Western Australia, and are intended to foster resource development and related infrastructure investments. These agreements are approved and ratified by the Parliament of Western Australia. The State Agreement relevant to the development of certain of our Western Australian operations is the agreement authorized by the Mineral Sands (Cooljarloo) Mining and Processing Agreement Act 1988 (WA). This agreement concluded in March 2020 and Tronox's rights and obligations are now covered by the Western Australian Mining Act.
Regulation of Finished Product Manufacturing
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Governmental authorities regulate the generation and treatment of waste and air emissions at our operations and facilities. At many of our operations, we also comply with worldwide, voluntary standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), a nongovernmental organization that promotes the development of standards and serves as a bridging organization for quality and environmental standards, such as ISO 9002 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental management.
Chemical Registration
As a chemical manufacturer with global operations, we are subject to a wide array of regulations regarding the import, export, labelling, use, storage and disposal of our products. We are obliged to comply with the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation in Europe, as well as a growing list of analogous regimes in other parts of the world, including China, South Korea and Taiwan. Manufacturers and importers of chemical substances must register information regarding the properties of their existing chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). REACH regulations require chemical substances which are newly imported or manufactured in the EU to be registered before being placed on the market, assessed for human health or environmental risk and for registrations to be updated periodically such as when new information

emerges relevant to human health or environmental risks associated with the production or use of the substance. In 2020, the European Commission adopted a regulation classifying certain forms of TiO2 with a particular aerodynamic diameter as a Category 2 carcinogen by inhalation. This regulation came into effect in October 2021. For additional information on this topic, see section entitled "Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Legal and Regulatory Environment - Our TiO2 products are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may impede or inhibit widespread usage of TiO2 and / or diminish the Company's ability to sustain or grow its business or may add significant costs of doing business."
Greenhouse Gas Regulation
Globally, our operations are subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”). We currently report and manage GHG emissions as required by law for sites located in jurisdictions requiring such managing and reporting of GHGs, primarily the European Union and Australia. For additional information on this topic, see section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to our Legal and Regulatory Environment - ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation.”
