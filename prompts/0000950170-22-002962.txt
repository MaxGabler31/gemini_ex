Company Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates to address serious diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. Our approach is to develop drug candidates based on mechanisms of action that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials. Our most advanced drug candidates are under development for the treatment of NASH using clinically-validated and complementary mechanisms of action to drive meaningful clinical benefits for patients. In our NASH programs, these mechanisms have demonstrated significant improvements on histological and non-invasive markers of the disease, though no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. In addition, by developing combination therapies, we are aiming to expand the reach of our single-agent drug candidates through improved response rates, better tolerability and improved compliance as compared to monotherapy regimens. We also have an oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist in pre-clinical development that may target metabolic diseases such as obesity as well as NASH. Beyond NASH, we plan to explore other indications with high unmet need using our pipeline drug candidates.
 Our most advanced program is TERN-101, a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple clinical trials. In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events (AEs) across treatment groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus, or itching. Multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were also evaluated, including changes in liver fibro-inflammation measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) corrected T1 (cT1), liver fat content by MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), pharmacodynamic parameters, and serum NASH biomarkers. We believe TERN-101 is the first FXR agonist product candidate to show significant improvements in cT1, an imaging marker of liver inflammation and fibrosis linked to clinical outcomes, in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial. In light of the positive results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.
 Our second clinical stage program, TERN-201, is a highly selective inhibitor of Vascular Adhesion Protein-1 (VAP-1). We expect to announce top-line data from Part 1 of our Phase 1b AVIATION trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in March 2022. We initiated Part 2 of our AVIATION trial in the first quarter of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. We are also evaluating the potential to co-administer TERN-201 in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment.
Our third clinical stage program is TERN-501, a Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta (THR-β) agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In the single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. Significant effects on sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial of another THR-β agonist. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.


We are also developing an oral small-molecule GLP-1R agonist. Synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for diabetes and obesity, which are conditions that often accompany NASH. We designated a development candidate for our GLP-1R program as TERN-601 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We plan to engage in IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in 2023.
NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, that affects up to 20 million people in the United States, and up to 5% of the global population, and for which there is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, lifetime costs of treating and managing NASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved therapies. NASH is a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, NASH patients often exhibit elevated levels of glucose and atherogenic lipids, are overweight or obese and accumulate excessive lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH can lead to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and increased risk for hepatic carcinoma and liver-related mortality.
Obesity is caused by weight gain resulting from an energy imbalance in the body driven by a greater consumption of calories than those expended. Declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization over 20 years ago, obesity has continued to rise significantly around the world. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, a third of U.S. adults 20 years of age and older are obese. Obesity has been shown to increase the risks of many diseases and conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, arthritis, sleep apnea and some cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon). According to a recent study, obesity was associated with an estimated $260 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the United States. GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have been shown to address insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, represent an emerging class of therapies used to achieve weight loss. Consensus estimates forecast worldwide sales of GLP-1 therapeutics and its combinations to exceed $16 billion in 2021 and grow to over $30 billion by 2026.
 Our Pipeline Programs
Our most advanced wholly owned, single-agent drug candidates are under development for the treatment of NASH using complementary mechanisms of action to drive meaningful clinical benefits for patients. We also have a wholly owned drug candidate in pre-clinical development that may target metabolic diseases such as obesity as well as NASH. In addition to our single-agent drug candidates, our wholly owned pipeline includes combination therapy candidates that are intended to address each of the distinct pathogenic disease processes of NASH, while improving the overall metabolic profile of patients. Beyond NASH and obesity, we plan to explore other indications with high unmet need using our wholly owned drug candidates. In addition to our wholly owned drug candidates, we have an allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor with an active IND in China, which is being developed in the greater China region by our development partner.
 

Pipeline Candidates for NASH and Metabolic Diseases:
•TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor, or FXR, agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These safety and tolerability issues have been observed in clinical trials for other FXR agonists and have generally been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across treatment groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus. We believe TERN-101 is the first FXR agonist product candidate to show significant improvements in cT1, an imaging marker of liver inflammation and fibrosis linked to clinical outcomes, in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial. In light of the positive results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023. We received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA. 
 •TERN-201 is a highly-selective inhibitor of Vascular Adhesion Protein-1, or VAP-1, that has demonstrated sustained target engagement in clinical trials without the off-target liabilities associated with other VAP-1 inhibitors in development. VAP-1 facilitates the deceleration, binding, and transmigration of leukocytes from the bloodstream into the liver and produces reactive oxygen species that promote liver inflammation and fibrosis. VAP-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of NASH patients in response to local lipotoxicity and liver injury. In a Phase 2a clinical trial of another developer’s VAP-1 inhibitor in NASH patients, 12 weeks of administration demonstrated significant, dose-dependent improvements in NASH biomarkers, providing clinical proof of concept for VAP-1 inhibition in NASH. In our Phase 1a first-in-human (SAD/MAD) clinical trial in 61 healthy subjects, TERN-201 was shown to fully suppress plasma VAP-1 activity at all of the doses we evaluated. TERN-201 was selected for development over other discovery candidates because it is highly specific for VAP-1 inhibition and has minimal potential for off-target effects. We expect to announce top-line data from Part 1 of our Phase 1b AVIATION Trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in March 2022. We initiated Part 2 of our AVIATION trial in the first quarter of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. We are also evaluating the potential to co-administer TERN-201 in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-201 for the treatment of NASH in August 2020. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA. 


•TERN-501 is a Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta, or THR-β, agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. Agonism of THR-β increases fatty acid metabolism via mitochondrial oxidation and affects cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. As a result, THR-β stimulation has the ability to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve serum lipid parameters including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. TERN-501 has high liver distribution and is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity and other off-target effects associated with non-selective THR stimulation. Finally, TERN-501 has been designed to be metabolically stable and is therefore expected to have little pharmacokinetic variability and a low clinical dose, making it an attractive candidate for use in fixed-dose combinations for NASH treatment. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol. In the SAD and MAD cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. Significant effects on SHBG, a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.
 •TERN-601 is our small-molecule Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor, or GLP-1R, agonist program that is intended to be orally administered for NASH and metabolic diseases such as obesity. Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents and children and is often defined by having an elevated body mass index (BMI). Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. GLP-1 offers multiple benefits including increased insulin secretion to the pancreas, reduced glucagon secretion in the liver, slowed gastric emptying into the gut, increased sense of satiety in the brain and reduced inflammation. Synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH. However, approved synthetic GLP-1 peptides may require higher doses and frequent subcutaneous injections. This injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use in NASH patients, particularly if efficacious oral NASH treatments become available. Our GLP-1R program has identified several potentially suitable small-molecule scaffolds. We have optimized these series of compounds and identified structures that we believe are suitable for oral administration as a single-agent or in combination with other drug candidates within our pipeline. We designated a development candidate for our GLP-1R program as TERN-601 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We plan to engage in IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in 2023.
 Combinations for NASH:
 Several prior clinical trials evaluating single-agent therapies for NASH have shown only moderate histological improvements and exhibited tolerability issues with some of these agents at high doses. We believe that developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are well-positioned to develop multiple combination therapies for NASH with our extensive experience in combination drug development and the ability to leverage our pipeline of wholly owned single-agents that we believe are suitable for orally administered combination development.

We believe that therapies targeting steatosis (TERN-101 and TERN-501), inflammation (TERN-101 and TERN-201) and fibrosis (TERN-101 and TERN-201) in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical outcomes. Clinical trials of GLP-1 agonists (TERN-601) in NASH patients have shown that a greater proportion of patients achieved NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and experienced improvement of other metabolic outcomes such as weight loss and glycemic control as compared to placebo.
 We expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial evaluating a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023. We are also assessing the potential utility of combinations of TERN-201 with assets inside and outside of our pipeline. Given the strength of our internal resources and capabilities, we have the flexibility to independently advance our combination therapies without the need for a co-development partner at this time.
Other Pipeline Candidates
 TRN-000632 is a potent, allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket that is in development for chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML. We out-licensed TRN-000632 to Hansoh Pharmaceuticals for development in the greater China region, while retaining all rights worldwide outside of greater China. TRN-000632 is referred to by Hansoh Pharmaceuticals as HS-10382. In January 2022, the National Medical Products Administration of the People’s Republic of China granted a clinical trial notice (equivalent to an IND in the United States) for TRN-000632 tablets in CML. We intend to explore strategic and partnership options for the development and commercialization of TRN-000632 outside of greater China.
 Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop and commercialize differentiated monotherapies and combination therapies for serious diseases such as NASH and obesity. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:
•Develop improved drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action. We are developing a portfolio of small-molecule drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action for the treatment of serious diseases such as NASH and obesity. The mechanisms of action targeted by the current drug candidates in our pipeline portfolio are the same mechanisms of action targeted by other drug candidates that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials. However, these clinical trials have also highlighted an opportunity for us to meaningfully improve the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies utilizing these mechanisms. Based on this premise, we are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in a high proportion of patients in the target indication as either single-agent or combination therapies. 
 •Leverage non-invasive biomarkers to rapidly advance our single-agent drug candidates. We are advancing our single-agent drug candidates through clinical proof-of-concept trials on an expedited basis by using relevant non-invasive biomarkers in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to efficiently confirm and benchmark target engagement or efficacy without the need for liver biopsies. We are looking to pioneer the use of non-invasive technologies (NIT) as potential novel surrogate endpoints for NASH, and are pursuing multiple avenues to achieve this outcome in collaboration with the broader NASH community. We believe this approach may enable us to accelerate enrollment in our clinical trials and achieve significantly shorter development timelines. 


•Advance our portfolio of combination therapy candidates for the treatment of NASH. In addition to developing our single-agent drug candidates, we are evaluating and developing fixed-dose combination therapies to address the multiple disease processes of NASH, while improving the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. The outcomes of our monotherapy biomarker-based clinical trials will further inform our decision to pursue the utility of our drug candidates as monotherapies or in fixed-dose-combinations that we believe have synergistic therapeutic effect and well-balanced safety profiles. We have identified and are advancing our first combination therapy candidate for NASH, involving a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501, and expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023. We are also evaluating the potential to co-administer TERN-201, a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent, in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment. 
 •Advance our earlier stage program and expand applications for our existing drug candidates. We have identified a GLP-1R small-molecule agonist, designated TERN-601, with the potential to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, NASH and other metabolic diseases. Our TERN-601 program is targeting the development of a product for once-daily oral administration to overcome the limitations of existing GLP-1 agonists and enable widespread use in patients with obesity, NASH and other diseases. We plan to engage in IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in 2023. Beyond obesity and NASH, our goal is to maximize the commercial potential of our existing drug candidates by exploring additional indications supported by their underlying biology and mechanism. We will maintain a focused and disciplined strategy in evaluating potential follow-on indications that may merit further advancement. 
 •Independently develop and commercialize our drug candidates in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize the value and benefit to patients. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those drug candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on drug candidates, such as TRN-000632, that we believe have promising utility in disease areas, patient populations or geographies that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. 
 Background on NASH
NASH is a severe form of NAFLD, a common liver disease characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver (steatosis). When hepatic steatosis results in liver inflammation and, in many cases, fibrosis, it results in NASH, a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, many NASH patients exhibit broader concomitant metabolic issues such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity and excess lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH leads to cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease, with the associated risks for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. NASH was recently identified as the second leading etiologic indication for liver transplantation in the United States, and it is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the coming years.
NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, affecting 80 to 100 million individuals. Among persons with NAFLD, approximately 20% will progress to NASH, which is currently estimated to affect 20 million adults in the United States. Progression of liver fibrosis ultimately leads to cirrhosis in an estimated 20% of patients with NASH. With an aging population and the markedly increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia/metabolic syndrome worldwide, NAFLD and NASH have increased greatly in prevalence, posing a significant healthcare challenge. Currently, no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, lifetime costs of treating and managing NASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved therapies.

Etiology of NASH
NAFLD and NASH are classified as progressive metabolic diseases, often correlated with chronic excess caloric intake, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Physiologically, hepatocytes in the liver can act as a repository for excess energy stored by the body. As humans consume disproportionate amounts of calories relative to those burned on a consistent basis, the body becomes overweight, and organs, including the liver, become burdened by fatty tissue. With the liver acting as the hub for excess energy and energy conversion, an imbalance develops with more delivery of fats and triglycerides to the liver, an increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis, and impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation and removal of liver fat, resulting in NAFLD.
Within the steatotic liver, fat deposits can create lipotoxic effects to the surrounding liver tissue, resulting in hepatocyte stress and injury. Local increases in reactive oxygenation species can induce hepatocytes to undergo cell death and create an inflammatory response within the organ. VAP-1 is over expressed in affected areas of the liver, serving as an attachment point for white blood cells and triggering their recruitment from the bloodstream into the liver. These white blood cells are stimulated by local lipotoxic effects and the presence of reactive oxygenation species, producing cytokines which further exacerbate local inflammatory cascades.
Inflammatory cascades in the liver activate hepatic stellate cells to excrete extracellular matrix resulting in liver fibrosis. Over time, fibrosis progresses, increasingly replacing diseased and normal liver tissue with scar tissue. Eventually, most of the liver is replaced by fibrotic tissue, which histologically is categorized as cirrhosis. While some cirrhotic patients have enough functional liver tissue to maintain hepatic activity, over time, the liver fails, resulting in decompensated liver disease and the need for liver transplantation to avoid liver related death. Furthermore, cirrhosis is a key risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.
NASH is currently diagnosed by histological findings on liver biopsy. In clinical trials, recommended scoring systems assess (i) liver fibrosis and (ii) steatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD Activity Score, or NAS, a composite score that grades the degree of three non-fibrotic histologic features of NASH: steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation. Efficacious responses to treatment in NASH clinical trials are usually considered to be either an improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of the NAS, or an improvement of the NAS without worsening of fibrosis.
Increasingly, non-invasive blood and imaging tests are being used in clinical practice to diagnose NASH. MRI-derived biomarkers proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and iron-corrected T1 mapping (cT1) are gaining traction as emerging alternatives to biopsy for NASH. cT1 measures free-water content in liver tissue, which has shown a strong correlation with inflammation and fibrosis histology. An estimated difference of 88 milliseconds in cT1 relaxation time has been related to a two-point difference in overall NAS. While MRI-PDFF and cT1 both correlate with NAS, only cT1 correlates with fibrosis. Further, liver cT1 has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. As data from these non-invasive assessments continue to accumulate—for initial diagnosis of NASH, monitoring of disease progression over time, and monitoring response to treatment—these approaches may replace liver biopsy, both in clinical practice and clinical trials. In its December 2018 draft NASH guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to include non-invasive biomarkers in clinical studies of experimental NASH treatments in order to accelerate development and supplant liver biopsy. More recently, at The Liver Meeting in November 2021, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) issued practice guidelines recommending blood and imaging-based non-invasive assessments to determine fibrosis staging prior to considering a liver biopsy. To accelerate the usage of NITs as surrogate endpoints for NASH, we joined the steering committee of the NAIL-NIT Consortium, a multi-stakeholder effort to link non-invasive testing directly to outcomes. NAIL-NIT’s preliminary planned activities include a prospective six-year study of NASH patients and, separately, a retrospective analysis of NASH patient cases to establish the best utilization of the growing array of non-invasive testing methods in the treatment, diagnosis and monitoring of NASH patients.

Treatment of NASH
There currently are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of NASH, and available treatment options are limited to control of metabolic dysfunction, including weight loss, as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes. However, many patients are unable to achieve or maintain significant weight loss or comply long-term with the dietary and lifestyle changes required to reverse NASH. In order to optimally treat NASH and reduce the risk of liver cancer and liver-related mortality, the three distinct disease processes may each need to be addressed–steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, we believe an ideal NASH therapy will also aim to improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients such as improvements in glycemic control, atherogenic lipid improvement, weight loss, and reduction of lipotoxic fat. Single agents focusing on specific mechanisms contributing to one of these three processes, each involving multiple pathways, have demonstrated only modest results to date. As such, combination therapies have the potential to better address the multitude of desired properties for the treatment of NASH.
 The following table summarizes some of the treatment approaches for NASH currently in clinical development, together with limitations observed and Terns’ differentiated approach. Among the small-molecule programs with validated mechanisms, we believe FXR agonism, VAP-1 inhibition, THR-β agonism, and GLP-1 agonism have great potential, not only as targets for single-agent therapy, but also as key components in combination therapies.

Our Clinical Stage Programs in NASH
 We are developing a portfolio of small-molecules that address the multiple hepatic disease processes of NASH in order to drive meaningful clinical benefits. Our most advanced program, TERN-101, is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple clinical trials. We announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT clinical trial of TERN-101 in NASH in June 2021. Our second clinical stage program, TERN-201, is a highly selective inhibitor of VAP-1, which directly addresses hepatic inflammation. We expect to announce top-line data from Part 1 of our Phase 1b AVIATION trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in March 2022. We initiated Part 2 of our AVIATION trial in the first quarter of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. Our third clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol. We are also pursuing two combination therapy programs to address the multiple disease processes of NASH and expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial evaluating a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns associated with other drugs in development.
TERN-101—a liver-distributed FXR agonist
Drug candidate summary
TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement; likely due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These tolerability issues have generally been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials as well as later phase studies of other FXR agonists in development and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation.
In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events, or AEs, across treatment groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event including pruritus. Multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were also evaluated, including changes in liver fibro-inflammation measured by MRI corrected T1, or cT1, liver fat content by MRI proton density fat fraction, or MRI-PDFF, pharmacodynamic parameters, and serum NASH biomarkers. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.
FXR agonists may address NASH in different liver cell types
FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. In the hepatocyte, FXR activation induces small heterodimer partner, or SHP, a key metabolic regulator. The upregulation of SHP by FXR reduces the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1C, or SREBP1C, a master regulator of triglyceride synthesis. FXR-mediated inhibition of SREBP1C and subsequent reduction in triglyceride levels could result in reduced hepatic steatosis. FXR also plays a role in modulating hepatic inflammation. Activation of FXR in the hepatocyte represses nuclear factor-kB, or NF-kB, via induction of SHP, thereby reducing hepatic inflammation. FXR activation is also directly associated with reduction in hepatic inflammation in Kupffer cells. In hepatic stellate cells, FXR activation reduces fibrogenic markers such collagen type 1 alpha 1, or Col1a1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, or TIMP1. Inhibition of Col1a1 and TIMP1 reduces collagen synthesis and increases the degradation of the extracellular matrix, or ECM, thereby reducing liver fibrosis.


A liver-distributed FXR agonist has the potential to address NASH
by acting on the three key disease processes and cell types
    
Clinical validation of FXR agonists
FXR agonism has been investigated in large-scale clinical trials and has shown clinically relevant improvements in NASH. In these clinical trials, FXR agonists have shown significant histological NASH improvements in fibrosis, as well as improvement in markers of liver function.
Limitations of other FXR agonists: pruritus and adverse lipid changes
Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These tolerability issues have been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials as well as later phase studies for other FXR agonists as shown in the table below and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. However, our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 was the first 12 week controlled clinical trial of an FXR agonist to demonstrate no discontinuations due to any adverse event, including pruritus. An FXR agonist that can demonstrate improved liver health with minimal adverse effects would have great potential benefits for NASH patients.

 We believe the liabilities from the other FXR agonists may be due to their activation of FXR outside the liver, particularly in the intestine. FXR activation in intestinal enterocytes results in the secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 19, or FGF19, which has been associated with increased serum low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol in published studies. Pruritus has been observed in clinical studies of other FXR agonists known to activate intestinal FXR. On the other hand, the use of bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine or colesevelam) or ileal bile acid transporter, or IBAT, inhibitors has been demonstrated in several clinical studies to reduce plasma LDL, cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia and also to mitigate pruritus in patients with cholestatic liver disease, potentially through prevention of FXR activation. Therefore, we believe that an FXR agonist with sustained activity in the liver, but only minimal or transient intestinal or other extrahepatic FXR activity, would likely not be associated with pruritus or adverse lipid changes.
Our solution: TERN-101, a liver-distributed FXR agonist
We believe TERN-101 has been well-tolerated in completed clinical trials to date because of its high liver distribution, thereby minimizing activation of intestinal pathways that may be associated with pruritus and adverse lipid changes. The figure on the left below demonstrates in a preclinical model that administration of TERN-101 results in significantly higher distribution to the liver compared to other FXR agonists. The figure on the right below demonstrates that administration of TERN-101 is also associated with much higher activation of liver-related FXR gene expression, in contrast to intestinally-directed FXR agonists that have greater FXR gene activation in the intestine than in the liver. Studies have demonstrated that there is minimal overlap between liver and intestine FXR binding sites, indicating potentially a high degree of tissue-specific FXR function.

TERN-101 preferentially distributes to liver and induces liver-specific genes

The information from the figure above (right) represents preclinical data derived from a mouse study model of SHP gene expression conducted by Terns after 7 days of dosing with TERN-101 (10 mg/kg), OCA (30 mg/kg) and tropifexor (0.3 mg/kg). SHP functions to inhibit bile acid synthesis.
 TERN-101 administration demonstrates sustained FXR activation in the liver
The liver-distributed profile of TERN-101 has been demonstrated in a Phase 1 clinical trial of the pharmacodynamics of TERN-101 in 36 human subjects. Sustained liver FXR activation in human subjects was demonstrated by dose-dependent decreases in 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, or C4, concentrations that are among the most potent demonstrated with an FXR agonist to date. A decrease in C4 is a surrogate marker for FXR activation in the liver. In contrast to sustained liver FXR activation, repeated administration of TERN-101 over seven days resulted in only a transient increase of FGF19, suggesting transient intestinal FXR activation while the drug is being absorbed. Data from other FXR agonists in development demonstrate a much more sustained increase in FGF19 that persists through repeat administrations, which may indicate that sustained intestinal FXR activation is associated with their underlying tolerability issues.

TERN-101 induces sustained suppression of C4 but only transient increases of FGF19
   Figure: Change in C4 relative to baseline (Day 1) on Day 7. FGF19 figure represents the mean FGF19 plasma concentration on Day 7.
Phase 2 clinical development of TERN-101
In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. Based on these positive results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of TERN-101 co-administered with our thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.
 The LIFT Study is a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 100 patients with phenotypic or biopsy-diagnosed NASH, identified either by prior biopsy or clinical diagnosis (liver stiffness measured by transient elastography of 7.6—25 kPa and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) > 300). Clinical trial participants received once-daily oral administration of placebo or TERN-101 tablet doses of 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events. Multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were also evaluated including changes in liver fibro-inflammation measured by cT1, liver fat content by MRI-PDFF, pharmacodynamic parameters, and serum NASH biomarkers.
TERN-101 Phase 2a LIFT trial design
     
TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across treatment groups. All treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus.

(1)COVID-19 pneumonia
 (2)Urinary tract infection
 All pruritus-related AEs were mild or moderate. The patient incidence of pruritus was generally balanced across TERN-101 treatment groups. Most pruritus AEs were mild and resolved during continued TERN-101 treatment.
 
* CTCAE: common terminology criteria for adverse events
 In the Phase 1 study in healthy subjects, administration of TERN-101 resulted in sustained C4 suppression but only transient effects on FGF19 induction, possibly reflecting higher levels of FXR target engagement in the liver compared to intestine. Data from the Phase 2a LIFT Study were consistent with the prior study and showed statistically significant suppression of trough C4 levels in the 10 mg and 15 mg groups but only transient increases in FGF19.
 No change in LDL cholesterol was observed in patients in the 5 mg and 10 mg TERN-101 arms as compared to placebo. Statistically significant LDL changes were observed only in the 15 mg arm. Significant decreases in HDL cholesterol were observed in all TERN-101 dose groups at Week 4 and Week 8 but returned toward baseline in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups without differences from placebo at Week 12. Decreases in HDL were significantly different from placebo for the 15 mg group at all observed timepoints through Week 12.


   p-value: * < 0.05, **<0.01
 Multiple efficacy biomarkers of NASH, including cT1 and MRI-PDFF, were evaluated in the LIFT Study. Mean changes in cT1 at Week 12 were -0.8 msec for placebo, -38.0 msec (p=0.033) for the 5 mg arm, -57.7 msec (p=0.002) for the 10 mg arm, and -74.0 msec (p<0.001) for the 15 mg arm. Improvements of at least 80 msec in cT1 were observed in a significant proportion of patients in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups at Week 12 as compared to placebo. Significant decreases in cT1 were also observed at Week 6 for all dose groups. cT1 is a magnetic resonance-based imaging test measuring free-water content in liver tissue, which has shown a strong correlation with inflammation and fibrosis histology and clinical outcomes in patients with liver disease. Mean relative changes in MRI-PDFF were -8.4% (placebo), -15.1% (5 mg), -19.7% (10 mg), and -12.9% (15 mg) at Week 12. Mean relative changes in MRI-PDFF were significant at Week 6 for the 10 mg and 15 mg dose groups compared to placebo, although these changes were not statistically significant at Week 12. MRI-PDFF is an imaging marker that measures liver fat content. No discernable trends were observed in initial analyses of the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score, CK-18 and Pro-C3.
 Prior to the LIFT Study, we evaluated TERN-101 across four completed Phase 1 clinical trials in 136 subjects, including 119 subjects in whom TERN-101 was administered. In the Phase 1 trials, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with no confirmed dose-related tolerability signals. AEs tended to be mild to moderate, with no dose-related increases in AEs. In all four Phase 1 clinical trials of TERN-101, none of the 119 subjects who received TERN-101 reported pruritus, and the serum lipid profiles among TERN-101 recipients were similar to placebo recipients even at high doses.
 TERN-201 – a highly selective VAP-1 inhibitor
Drug candidate summary
TERN-201 is a highly selective, irreversible, covalent inhibitor of VAP-1. In our Phase 1a first-in-human (SAD/MAD) clinical trial across 61 healthy subjects, TERN-201 was shown to fully suppress plasma VAP-1 activity at all of the doses that we evaluated and VAP-1 suppression was evident up to days after a single dose. In preclinical studies, TERN-201 reduced fibrosis in a model of liver injury in a dose-dependent manner, with inflammation and fibrosis significantly reduced after treatment. TERN-201 exhibits high selectivity for VAP-1 and enhanced liver distribution. Importantly, TERN-201 does not inhibit human MAO-A and MAO-B, thereby avoiding risks associated with MAO inhibition. We believe the sustained activity of TERN-201, with its VAP-1 selectivity and anticipated low therapeutic dose, make it suitable for coadministration with therapies directed at steatosis and other metabolic processes involved in NASH. We expect to announce top-line data from Part 1 of our Phase 1b AVIATION trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in March 2022. We initiated Part 2 of our AVIATION trial in the first quarter of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-201 for the treatment of NASH in August 2020. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.

Overview of VAP-1 biology in NASH
As liver damage accumulates in NAFLD and NASH patients, VAP-1 becomes increasingly expressed on the endothelium of blood vessels within the liver. Through its function as an adhesion molecule, VAP-1 facilitates the deceleration, binding and transmigration of white blood cells (leukocytes) from the blood stream into the liver. VAP-1 ligands on white blood cells include Siglec-9 and Siglec-10, which may stimulate VAP-1 enzymatic activity leading to production of aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygenation species (ROS). White blood cells respond to local liver tissue damage releasing cytokines and other factors that may further exacerbate liver inflammation. Together, the cytokine cascades resulting from white blood cell liver penetration and local ROS-mediated oxidative stress and tissue damage, result in fibrosis through the activation of hepatic stellate cells to produce collagen. The following graphic illustrates this process.
VAP-1 recruits white blood cells to the liver and increases inflammation and fibrosis
   Clinical validation of VAP-1 inhibition in NASH
VAP-1 inhibition has the potential to address the inflammatory process in NASH patients. Preclinical data have demonstrated that VAP-1 inhibition improves liver histology and serum biomarkers. VAP-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of NASH patients in response to local lipotoxicity and liver injury. Increased levels of soluble VAP-1 in the plasma is also associated with the presence of NASH, and with increasing liver fibrosis. In a Phase 2a clinical trial, administration of a different VAP-1 inhibitor over 12 weeks in NASH patients demonstrated significant, dose dependent decreases from baseline in AST, GGT, CK-18 and ALT, markers of liver injury and inflammation and cell death compared to placebo. Improvements in these markers provide clinical proof-of-concept for VAP-1 inhibition as a treatment approach in NASH.
Limitations of other VAP-1 inhibitors in development
A clinical trial of another VAP-1 inhibitor in NASH patients demonstrated improvements in markers of liver injury, inflammation and cell death. However, other VAP-1 inhibitors currently in development for NASH are associated MAO inhibition due to their lack of specificity for binding VAP-1. Drugs that inhibit MAO create the risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis when administered with commonly prescribed serotonergic drugs and with tyramine-containing foods. Therefore, we believe a VAP-1 inhibitor with improved selectivity for VAP-1 inhibition that lacks the potential to inhibit MAO-A or MAO-B could provide meaningful clinical benefit to NASH patients in reducing inflammation and liver fibrosis without risks related to MAO inhibition.

Our solution for VAP-1 inhibition: TERN-201
TERN-201 was selected over other discovery candidates because it is highly specific for VAP-1 inhibition and has minimal potential to inhibit MAO-A or MAO-B at clinically relevant concentrations. Preclinical studies showed that TERN-201 was greater than 7000-fold more selective for VAP-1 than for MAO-A or MAO-B. In clinical studies, TERN-201 has shown strong VAP-1 inhibition at all doses studied, and plasma TERN-201 concentrations, or Cmax, after 7 days of dosing were more than 300 times lower than the IC50 concentrations for MAO-A and MAO–B inhibition at the highest dose level studied. The graph below illustrates the selectivity of TERN-201 for VAP-1 inhibition over MAO inhibition shown in preclinical studies.

Clinical development of TERN-201
We are conducting an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients, known as the AVIATION trial. The AVIATION trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in approximately 60 patients who have presumed non-cirrhotic NASH based on clinical characteristics or prior biopsy and a baseline cT1 reading of greater than 800 ms. The AVIATION trial is evaluating TERN-201 in two parts – Part 1 is evaluating a 10 mg dose of TERN-101 against placebo and Part 2 is evaluating a 20 mg dose of TERN-201 against placebo. The primary endpoint of this trial is the assessment of the safety and tolerability of TERN-201. Other endpoints include the assessment of pharmacokinetic measures as well as the evaluation of cT1, CK-18, ALT and plasma VAP-1 activity. We expect to announce top-line data from Part 1 of our Phase 1b AVIATION trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in March 2022. We initiated Part 2 of our AVIATION trial in the first quarter of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. Following this clinical trial, we will consider subsequent trials of TERN-201 as monotherapy or potentially in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment.


Prior to initiating our AVIATION trial, we completed a first-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial (SAD/MAD) of TERN-201 which assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, in 61 healthy subjects. Single oral TERN-201 doses of 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg and repeat doses of 1 mg and 4 mg (once-daily for 7 days) and 10 mg (once-daily for 14 days) were administered. In the trial, TERN-201 target engagement was assessed by measuring decreases from baseline in the semi-carbazide sensitive amine oxidase, or SSAO, activity which results from VAP-1 enzymatic activity, and by changes from baseline in methylamine, a biomarker that increases in concentration in the blood as its metabolism by VAP-1 is inhibited.
TERN-201 demonstrated robust and sustained VAP-1 target engagement. Near complete inhibition of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity was observed at four hours post-dose on Day One in all single and multiple dose groups. There was evidence of dose dependent sustained decreases in VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity for one week after completion of single and repeat dosing due to covalent binding of TERN-201 to VAP-1 and the rate of regeneration of VAP-1 over several days after completion of TERN-201 dosing. Near complete suppression of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity persisted to 7 days after completion of a single TERN-201 dose of 10 mg and repeat doses of 4 mg and 10 mg. Changes from baseline in methylamine were also dose dependent, with the greatest increases from baseline observed in the TERN-201 10 mg dose group in both single and multiple dose cohorts.
TERN-201 demonstrates near complete inhibition of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity in single ascending dose Phase 1 trial
     
In the Phase 1 SAD/MAD clinical trial, TERN-201 administered for up to 14 days was generally well-tolerated with no tolerability signals based on AEs, safety laboratory testing and electrocardiogram monitoring. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that TERN-201 is not extensively metabolized and is unlikely to inhibit or induce major drug metabolism pathways or MAOs; therefore, it has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. This profile as well as its pharmaceutical properties and anticipated low therapeutic dose make it a very attractive candidate for co-formulation with other drugs as part of a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination treatment for NASH.
TERN-501 – a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution
Drug candidate summary
TERN-501 is a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution, characteristics that are intended to improve safety and efficacy in NASH patients. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-β stimulation has been identified as a target for NASH on the basis of its potential to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve serum lipid parameters in NASH patients. For any THR agonist, a key concern is toxicity from excess systemic THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity through THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 has high metabolic stability and a low projected clinical dose, which we believe makes it an attractive candidate for fixed-dose combination co-formulations. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-501 for the treatment of NASH in June 2021. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.
 THR-β agonists for NASH
Thyroid hormone plays a central role in regulating metabolism, through its actions in multiple tissues, including fat, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver. THR-α and THR-β are nuclear receptors widely expressed in the body, but the two different isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissue types. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-α is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and bone. Selective agonism of THR -β in the liver has been identified as a target for NASH and validated in clinical trials on the basis of its potential to improve hepatic steatosis and lipid profiles in NASH patients.
Clinical validation of THR-β agonism
Data from other NASH clinical studies validate the potential of THR-β agonism as a NASH treatment (the data from other NASH clinical studies described in this paragraph are from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Phase 2 Study of MGL-3196 and Viking Therapeutics, Inc.’s Phase 2 Study of VK2809). In these clinical studies, two different THR-β agonists showed significant reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF, as well as reduction in lipid levels in serum, which may offer additional benefits to NASH patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular comorbidities. One of these clinical trials correlated reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF with histological responses including NAS reduction, NASH resolution and fibrosis resolution. In addition, this same clinical trial showed increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement, are correlated with significant reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAS reduction. These types of histological responses may be suitable for accelerated approval under current draft guidance from the FDA titled “Noncirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry.”

THR-β regulates key aspects of energy metabolism (e.g., fatty acid & lipid synthesis, liver fat removal through fatty acid oxidation)

 Limitations of THR-β targeting
For THR agonists, a key safety concern is the potential for adverse effects from off-target thyroid hormone receptor stimulation that may stem from either lack of selectivity for THR-β or high variations in pharmacokinetics due to the lack of metabolic stability. Selectivity for THR-β over THR-α is key to modulating the metabolic activities in the liver without triggering the unwanted effects of THR-α activation outside of the liver. Stimulation of THR-α can adversely affect the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system through increases in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle wasting, and reduced bone mineral density. Therefore, the identification of a selective THR-β agonist particularly with enhanced liver distribution, would have the potential to improve hepatic steatosis and serum lipid profiles while potentially avoiding adverse effects of THR-α activation. However, the use of a liver-targeted pro-drug approach to overcome THR selectivity has not completely avoided cardiac adverse events in clinical trials.
In addition to THR-β selectivity, metabolic stability and predictable pharmacokinetics are important considerations in the development of thyroid hormone activators. In a Phase 2 clinical trial of another selective THR-β agonist, lack of metabolic stability resulted in significant inter-patient variability in drug exposure that required PK monitoring and dose adjustments. Dose adjustments in widespread clinical practice present potential challenges in terms of patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, highly variable pharmacokinetics and unpredictable drug concentrations would hinder the potential for combination treatment in NASH patients.

Our solution for THR-β agonism: high THR-β-selectivity and improved metabolic stability
TERN-501 was selected over other discovery candidates because of its high selectivity for THR-β over THR-α, its improved metabolic stability and its enhanced liver-distribution, all of which are characteristics that are intended to improve efficacy and safety in NASH patients. TERN-501 has a similar structural backbone to other THR-β agonists in late stage development that are selective for THR-β. Furthermore, the TERN-501 chemical structure incorporates certain changes designed to enhance metabolic and pharmacokinetic stability, thereby limiting the need for individualized dose adjustments implemented in studies with other THR-β agonists. In a head-to-head comparison, TERN-501 has shown a 23-fold selectivity for THR-β over THR-α stimulation in a cell-free assay, which is higher than the selectivity for two other THR agonists currently in development. TERN-501 is not a pro-drug and does not rely on a metabolic process to make it pharmacologically active. The following chart illustrates the selectivity of TERN-501 as compared to a reference drug and the active metabolite of a pro-drug in clinical development for NASH.
TERN-501 demonstrates higher selectivity for THR-β over THR-α
   Non-clinical tissue distribution studies show that TERN-501 demonstrates enhanced liver distribution relative to plasma and other organs. From non-clinical studies, TERN-501 is projected to have a predictable human PK profile due to its improved metabolic stability. Due to its metabolic stability, we believe that TERN-501 is unlikely to require PK monitoring and individualized clinical dose adjustment in NASH patients, as was done in a certain clinical trial of another THR-β agonist in development that lacks metabolic stability and has variable PK in humans. As a result, TERN-501 may not have the potential challenges associated with monitoring and dose adjustment in clinical practice, including patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Further, TERN-501 is projected to have a low clinically efficacious dose range which, along with its metabolic stability, makes it attractive for long-term NASH treatment and for co-formulation as part of a fixed-dose combination.
Clinical development of TERN-501
In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol. Following the Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.


The Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 included SAD, MAD and drug-drug interaction, or DDI, cohorts evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TERN-501. Healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol were randomized to placebo (n=2) or TERN-501 (n=6) in each cohort. Volunteers randomized to TERN-501 received single doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg of TERN-501 in the SAD portion of the study or multiple doses of 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg of TERN-501 once daily for 14 days in the MAD portion of the study. In the DDI portion of the study, volunteers received open label TERN-501 co-administered with TERN-101, our liver-distributed FXR agonist also in development for the treatment of NASH.
 In the SAD and MAD cohorts, single and multiple doses of TERN-501 were generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. There were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-501 groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Thyroid function test results were consistent with THR-β agonists currently in clinical development, and there were no findings of clinical hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. There were no differences between placebo and any TERN-501 dose group in liver function abnormalities or mean change from baseline in liver transaminases at Day 15 in the MAD cohorts.
TERN-501 demonstrated a predictable pharmacokinetic profile with low variability: study drug plasma exposures were linear and approximately dose-proportional with no overlap between dose strengths. There was no significant accumulation of drug over 14 days of dosing. TERN-501 plasma half-life was greater than 13 hours in all single and repeat dose cohorts, supporting once-daily dosing. The overall PK profile indicates TERN-501 is well-suited for co-formulation with other small-molecule NASH agents as an oral, once-daily fixed dose combination.
 Significant effects on sex hormone binding globulin, or SHBG, a key PD marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. As further described in the table below, SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent, and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial.
 In addition, significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids including LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, or Apo-B, comparable to or greater than those observed in Phase 1 studies of other THR-β agonists being studied in late-stage clinical trials. All TERN-501 dose groups demonstrated significant decreases in LDL cholesterol compared to placebo during the dosing period. The maximum mean LDL cholesterol decreases over the treatment period were -13%, -22%, -28% and -27% for 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg doses, respectively, compared to placebo (-8%).
 The PD results from these MAD cohorts are summarized below:
 
 | TERN-501 MAD (QD)Mean % Change from Baseline to Day 15
 | Placebo (N=8) | 1 mg(N=6) | 3 mg (N=6) | 6 mg (N=6) | 10 mg (N=6)
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (%) | -6% | 17% | 57%* | 135%* | 165%* 
Low Density Lipoprotein - cholesterol (%) | -4% | -16% | -17% | -19% | -20%* 
Triglycerides (%) | -13% | -18% | -21% | -20% | -36%* 
Apolipoprotein-B (%) | -5% | -14% | -18%* | -23%* | -27%* 

 Note: Day 15 represents 24 hours following the last dose of TERN-501
 * p-value vs. placebo: <0.05


In the SAD cohorts, single doses of TERN-501 up to 60 mg resulted in significant and dose-dependent reductions in Apo-B and LDL cholesterol and significant increases in SHBG relative to placebo. In the DDI cohort, the combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 was well-tolerated. Preliminary PK results support the co-administration of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment.
 NASH Combination Therapy Programs
Several prior clinical trials evaluating single-agent therapies for NASH have shown only moderate histological improvements and exhibited tolerability issues with some of these agents at high doses. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are well-positioned to develop multiple combination therapies for NASH with our extensive experience in combination drug development and the ability to leverage from within our pipeline of wholly owned single-agents that we believe are attractive candidates for combination development. We are focused on developing combination therapies with clinically-validated mechanisms of action to address the multifaceted nature of NASH, while improving the overall metabolic profile of patients. We believe that therapies targeting steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical outcomes. Given the strength of our internal resources and capabilities, we have the flexibility to independently advance our combination therapies without the need for a co-development partner at this time.
 Preclinical data for combination therapies
We believe that a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 has the potential for improved therapeutic benefit for NASH patients. As a liver-distributed FXR agonist, TERN-101 is expected to have effects on multiple facets of NASH, including potential improvements in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. TERN-501 is a THR-β agonist that is expected to potently and rapidly reduce hepatic steatosis and normalize plasma lipid parameters through the modulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those modulated by liver FXR activation. A combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 would therefore be expected to significantly reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in NASH patients through their complementary effects without the need to use maximal dose levels of either agent. The combination may also result in a positive serum lipid profile since TERN-501 is expected to reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in NASH patients where FXR agonists have generally not demonstrated potentially therapeutic decreases in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides.
As seen in the charts below, the combination of the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501 showed robust efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of NASH by profoundly reducing steatosis and significantly improving fibrosis, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and ALT. The combination treatment of TERN-101 and TERN-501 also resulted in the expression of more than 800 additional distinct genes as compared to either agent alone, supporting our hypothesis that additional biological processes are activated by combination treatment. Together these results suggest that the combination of the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501 may provide additional benefits for NASH patients than either treatment alone.

Combination of TERN-101 + TERN-501 demonstrates improvements in liver histology and serum biomarkers in an in vivo NASH mouse model
   Figure: Data from a NASH mouse model. TERN-101 dose 3 mg/kg; TERN-501 dose 1 mg/kg. Liver steatosis (upper left), inflammation (upper middle) and fibrosis (upper right) were quantified by histological analysis for degree of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis. Serum was collected at termination and analyzed for triglycerides, or TG (lower left), total cholesterol, or TC, (lower middle) and a biomarker of liver damage, alanine aminotransferase, or ALT (lower right). Data for individual animals (dots) and mean (dashed line) are presented; **p <0.01, ***p <0.001, ****p <0.
We are also evaluating the potential to combine our VAP-1 inhibitor, TERN-201, with a metabolically active NASH treatment. We believe the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, sustained target engagement, VAP-1 selectivity and anticipated low therapeutic dose of TERN-201 make it suitable for co-administration with therapies directed at steatosis and other metabolic processes involved in NASH. For example, the combination of our FXR agonist TERN-101 and TERN-201 demonstrated histological improvements in inflammation and GGT, a biomarker of hepatic oxidative stress, in an in vivo rodent model of NASH.

Clinical development plan for NASH combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501
Our approach for developing a differentiated NASH combination regimen is to discover and develop promising drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action, advance them first as monotherapies to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and subsequently conduct Phase 1b or 2a trials to assess safety in NASH patients and potentially efficacious dose ranges using known non-invasive biomarkers of efficacy for these mechanisms of action. Subsequently, we intend to proceed to Phase 2a studies with the coadministration of two or more complimentary mechanisms of action—such as the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501—to assess the potential for combinations to generate additive or synergistic effects on these same non-invasive biomarkers relative to monotherapy and inform dose selection for later phase studies of the agents in combination. We then plan to proceed to longer duration Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials that can evaluate our individual monotherapies as well as promising combinations within the same trials to confirm treatment effects using surrogate endpoints. We believe this approach maximizes the chance of achieving higher NASH response rates compared to treatment approaches that rely exclusively on single-agent therapeutics and creates efficiencies through the evaluation of our individual monotherapies and combination treatments, allowing us to proceed to marketing authorization applications for those single-agent drug candidates and combination therapies that offer the clearest advantages to patients. 
Background on Obesity
 Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents and children and is often defined by having an elevated body mass index (BMI). Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity.
Obesity is major health epidemic that has been declared a disease by the American Medical Association and affects populations worldwide. The Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) estimates that nearly 93 million Americans struggle with obesity, and it is predicted to increase to 120 million Americans within the next five years. In addition, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates that 42 percent of adults over the age of 20 years old are obese.
 According to the OAC, there are over 40 medical conditions associated with obesity. The most prevalent obesity-related diseases include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, gallbladder disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, some forms of cancer, sleep apnea or respiratory problems and a variety of other conditions. According to the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy, the aggregate medical cost due to obesity among adults in the United States was $260.0 billion in 2016. A prior study examining the future health care costs attributable to obesity projected these annual expenditures to double every decade to approximately $780 billion by 2030, representing 14% of total United States health care costs. As a result, public and private stakeholders worldwide are taking steps to address obesity.
 Despite the rising obesity rate, increased public awareness of the obesity epidemic and significant pharmacoeconomic costs associated with obesity, there remains an unmet need for safe and effective pharmacological interventions. While nearly half of Americans meet the criteria for medical obesity pharmacotherapy, only 2% of adults receive medications for weight loss. Barriers to adequately prescribing weight loss medications may include inadequate training to prescribing such medications, misconceptions that excess body weight is due to lack of willpower, or that obesity is not a disease that should be treated with medications and surgery, even when indicated. We believe that the obesity epidemic continues to be a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and rising health care costs in the United States and represents an underserved therapeutic category for obesity patients.
 
Treatment for Obesity
 Treatments for obesity include lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), pharmaceutical therapies, surgery and device implantation. Modifications to diet and exercise are the preferred initial treatment for obesity. However, demands of sustained lifestyle modification for long periods of time tends to lead to attrition, often resulting in regained weight. When lifestyle modification alone has failed, pharmaceutical therapies are generally recommended.

The global pharmaceutical market for obesity was approximately $1 billion in 2020. With the recent launch of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity in 2021, the obesity market is expected to grow beyond $5 billion by 2025. Longer term estimates forecast the worldwide obesity market to exceed $27 billion by 2031, with the anticipated launches of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor dual agonist, and other novel injectable compounds. Several older approved agents, including amphetamine-like compounds such as naltrexone-bupropion and phentermine-topiramate, are indicated for short-term administration and not expected to contribute significantly to the obesity market.
 
TERN-601 - a pre-clinical oral GLP-1 for obesity and NASH
 
Drug Candidate Summary
 TERN-601 is an oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. Internal discovery of TERN-601 was driven by computational interaction mapping, chemical synthesis and in vitro characterization of approximately 100 GLP-1R agonist compounds. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we nominated TERN-601 as our GLP-1R agonist development candidate for obesity and NASH. We plan to engage in IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in 2023.
 
GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity and NASH
GLP-1R agonists are intended to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, NAFLD, NASH and other metabolic indications. Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. The natural endogenous ligand GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent-manner following food ingestion. GLP-1 has also been shown to reduce glucagon secretion in the liver, slow gastric emptying in the gut, create a sense of satiety in the brain, reduce inflammation and improve cardiac function. As a result, synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH.
 
Clinical validation of GLP-1 receptor agonists
 The recently approved once-weekly injection of semaglutide for chronic weight management demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 15% at 68 weeks when used with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity. Study participants also experienced improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Semaglutide also had positive effects on LDL and total cholesterol levels, although benefits were limited primarily to triglyceride reductions.
 Activation of the GLP-1 pathway has shown to be effective in driving NASH resolution in recent studies. In a 72-week Phase 2 trial of once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide, 320 biopsy-confirmed NASH patients were randomized to receive 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg semaglutide or placebo. The percentage of patients achieving NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was 40%, 36% and 59% in the 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, and 0.4 mg group, respectively, compared to 17% in the placebo group. The mean percentage weight loss was 13% in the 0.4 mg group compared to 1% in the placebo group. The Phase 2 trial showed treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients achieving NASH resolution compared to placebo. A meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of NAFLD or NASH was published in Metabolites in 2021. The systemic review assessed 11 placebo- or active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials that used GLP-1 receptor agonists including liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide or semaglutide for the treatment of NAFLD or NASH. Compared to placebo or reference therapy, treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists for a median of 26 weeks was associated with significant reductions in the absolute percentage of liver fat content on magnetic resonance-based techniques (pooled weighted mean difference: −3.9%) and serum liver enzyme levels, as well as with greater histological resolution of NASH without worsening of liver fibrosis (pooled random-effects odds ratio 4.1). Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists remain a promising treatment option for NAFLD or NASH warranting further investigation.


The development landscape for GLP-1 compounds is varied, including single agonists, multi-agonists, an agonist-antagonist combination, and can be generally grouped by route of administration. Injectable candidates under development may target GLP-1 and glucagon (ALT-801, BI 456906, cotadutide, and efinopegdutide), GLP-1 and GIP (tirzepatide), GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism (AMG 133) or GLP, GIP and glucagon (LY3437943), amongst others. Oral development candidates singly targeting GLP-1 and include LY3502970, danuglipron, PF-07081532 and semaglutide tablets, amongst others.
 
Limitations of GLP-1 receptor agonists
 Approved agents are synthetic peptides and potentially require higher doses administered by frequent subcutaneous injections for the potential treatment of obesity and NASH. The injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use in obesity and NASH patients, particularly if efficacious oral treatments become available. Although an oral GLP-1 peptide formulation is available for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it requires high doses, is associated with adverse effects and lacks NASH efficacy data. A non-peptidic small-molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonist may offer advantages over currently available peptide GLP-1R agonists that have been studied for the treatment of obesity and NASH.
 
Our solution for GLP-1 receptor agonists
 Our GLP-1R program has identified several potentially suitable small-molecule scaffolds. We have optimized these series of compounds and identified structures that are suitable for oral administration, once-daily dosing, and combination or coformulation with other NASH drug candidates within our pipeline. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we nominated a development candidate for our GLP-1R program, designated as TERN-601, and plan to engage in IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in 2023.
 Other Pipeline Candidate(s)
 TRN-000632 is a potent, allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket that is in development for chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML. In October 2021, Novartis’ asciminib became the first FDA-approved CML treatment that works by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket. However, in the Phase 3 CML trial of asciminib, over half of patients experienced Grade 3 or greater adverse events, with approximately one third of patients experiencing AEs leading to dose interruption or adjustment. The main efficacy outcome measure, major molecular response (MMR) after 24 weeks of treatment, was achieved in 25.5% of asciminib patients. Based on preclinical studies, we believe TRN-000632 may have superior anti-tumor activity and improved PK properties when compared to asciminib. We out-licensed TRN-000632 to Hansoh Pharmaceuticals for development in the greater China region, while retaining all rights worldwide outside of greater China. TRN-000632 is referred to by Hansoh Pharmaceuticals as HS-10382. In January 2022, the National Medical Products Administration of the People’s Republic of China granted a clinical trial notice (equivalent to an IND in the United States) for TRN-000632 in CML. We intend to explore strategic and partnership options for the development and commercialization of TRN-000632 outside of Greater China.
 Manufacturing and supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our drug candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers for manufacturing all our drug candidates for preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties.
If any of our drug candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of those drugs. Development and commercial quantities of any drugs that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval.

Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to establish a targeted commercial infrastructure in key geographies at the appropriate time prior to regulatory approval of our single-agent drugs and fixed-dose combination therapies. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships.
In addition, we will opportunistically explore commercialization partnerships in territories outside the United States. As our drug candidates progress through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of our target markets, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our commercialization strategies.
Competition
 The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We believe that our pipeline, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face potential worldwide competition from many different sources, including large multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, and smaller or earlier stage biotechnology companies. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. Given the high incidence of NASH and obesity, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver metabolic diseases, including NASH and obesity, will increase.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Although we believe our drug and combination therapy candidate programs possess appealing attributes, we cannot guarantee that our products will achieve regulatory or market success. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do, or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our drug candidate or any future drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used, and less costly, or have a better tolerability profile than our drugs. These competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. Should we not be able to compete with the aforementioned companies or others, it may hinder our ability to bring our product to market as planned.
Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. For our patent portfolio for pipeline drug candidates, we seek to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary know-how that may be important to the development of our business.

As of February 4, 2022, our owned and exclusively licensed patent portfolio includes:
•For TERN-101, our FXR agonist, we own six patent families and exclusively license from Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, two patent families, which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-101, its formulations, and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain liver, metabolic and other diseases and conditions. The composition-of-matter patent family currently includes one issued U.S. patent and over 20 granted foreign patents. The issued U.S. patent in the composition-of-matter patent family is projected to expire, inclusive of patent term adjustment, in 2029, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. Corresponding foreign patents are generally projected to expire in 2028, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.

The composition-of-matter patent family includes three issued U.S. patents, issued patents in China and the EPO, and 18 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EPO, India, Japan and Korea. The patents in this patent family and any patents issuing from patent applications therein are projected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. For more information regarding this exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, please see “—Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements.” 
 •For TERN-501, our THR-β agonist, we own four patent families which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-501 and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain liver, metabolic, and other diseases and conditions. The composition-of-matter patent family includes two issued U.S. patents and 22 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EPO, India, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in the composition-of-matter patent family are generally projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available. 
 •We own three patent families covering a number of GLP-1R agonists, including TERN-601. Any patents that may issue from applications in these patent families are generally projected to expire in 2041 and 2042, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available.
 •For TRN-000632, our small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, we own one patent family directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TRN-000632 and its methods of use in the treatment of leukemia and other diseases and conditions. The patent family includes one issued U.S. patent and 20 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EPO, India, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in the patent family are generally projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available. This patent family is subject to an exclusive option and license agreement for the greater China region with Hansoh (Shanghai) Healthtech Co., Ltd. and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Ltd., or collectively, Hansoh. For more information regarding this exclusive option and license agreement with Hansoh, please see “—Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements.”
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future drug candidates, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our drugs depends in large part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to, or licensed by, us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our drug candidates, discovery programs and processes. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our owned or licensed patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, in certain cases, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits such patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and the amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a product, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drugs receive FDA or analogous foreign approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drugs from the applicable authorities where patent term extension is available, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information of our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.
Moreover, third parties may still obtain this proprietary information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets and know how the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent or other intellectual property or other proprietary right would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or any of our drug candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements
TERN-101 License Agreement with Eli Lilly
In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, or the TERN-101 License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property rights, including patents applications filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions claiming the composition of the compound Eli Lilly has designated as LY2562175 and methods of using the same and certain know-how related to the manufacture of LY2562175 owned or controlled by Eli Lilly to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products containing LY2562175, or TERN-101 Products, for all uses and indications in humans. Eli Lilly also has the right, on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis, to negotiate an agreement governing the co-promotion of TERN-101 Products if we, or our sublicensees, decide to commercialize a TERN-101 Product in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.
Pursuant to the terms of the TERN-101 License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, apply for regulatory approval of and commercialize TERN-101 Products in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, Eli Lilly provided us, at its expense, certain support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials.
As consideration for the exclusive license, we are required to pay Eli Lilly up to an aggregate of $56 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events for TERN-101 Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under the TERN-101 License Agreement.
We are also required to pay tiered royalties calculated on a calendar year basis, ranging from mid-single digit to mid teen percentages, on annual net sales of TERN-101 Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on certain generic competition to a TERN-101 Product and amounts paid to any third party under a necessary license to such third party’s patent rights in order to develop, manufacture, commercialize or use a TERN-101 Product. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country, TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights infringed by the sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such TERN-101 Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country.
Any intellectual property or inventions developed solely by either party in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the TERN-101 License Agreement shall be owned solely by that party, and any jointly-developed intellectual property or inventions shall be jointly owned (although no joint development activities are anticipated). We have the sole responsibility to prosecute and maintain and the first right (but no obligation) to defend and enforce certain patents licensed under the TERN-101 License Agreement, including any patents that are solely and directly related to LY2562175 or TERN-101 Products.
The TERN-101 License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the TERN-101 Products on a country-by-country basis. Upon expiration of the TERN-101 License Agreement, the license granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual and non-exclusive. Either we or Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if we, our affiliates or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents.
TERN-201 License Agreement with Eli Lilly
In March 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, or the TERN-201 License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property rights, including patents applications filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions claiming the composition of the compound Eli Lilly has designated as LY3379274, and methods of using the same and certain know-how related to the manufacture of LY3379274 owned or controlled by Eli Lilly to develop, manufacture, and commercialize therapeutic products containing LY3379274, or TERN-201 Products, for all uses and indications in humans. Eli Lilly has a right of first negotiation to negotiate an agreement covering the commercialization of any TERN-201 Product before we negotiate the same with a third party. Eli Lilly also has the right, on a country-by-country and TERN-201 Product-by- TERN-201 Product basis, to negotiate an agreement governing the co-promotion of TERN-201 Products if we, or our sublicensees, decide to commercialize a TERN-201 Product in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.
Pursuant to the terms of the TERN-201 License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, apply for regulatory approval of and commercialize TERN-201 Products in the People’s Republic of China, the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In addition, Eli Lilly provided us, at its expense, certain support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials.
As initial consideration for the license under the TERN-201 License Agreement, we paid Eli Lilly a non-refundable, upfront payment of $4 million. As additional consideration for the exclusive license, we are required to pay Eli Lilly up to an aggregate of $104 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestone events for TERN-201 Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under the TERN-201 License Agreement.
We are also required to pay tiered royalties, ranging from mid-single digit to mid-teen percentages, on annual net sales of TERN-201 Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on certain generic competition to a TERN-201 Product and amounts paid to any third party under a necessary license to such third party’s patent rights in order to develop, manufacture, commercialize or use a TERN-201 Product. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country, TERN-201 Product-by-TERN-201 Product basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights infringed by the sale of such TERN-201 Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such TERN-201 Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such TERN-201 Product in such country.
Any intellectual property or inventions developed solely by either party in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the TERN-201 License Agreement shall be owned solely by that party, and any jointly-developed intellectual property or inventions shall be jointly owned (although no joint development activities are anticipated). We have the sole responsibility to prosecute and maintain and the first right (but no obligation) to defend and enforce certain patents licensed under the TERN-201 License Agreement, including any patents that are solely and directly related to LY3379274 or TERN-201 Products.
The TERN-201 License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the TERN-201 Products on a country-by-country basis. Upon expiration of the TERN-201 License Agreement, the license granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual and non-exclusive. Either we or Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country and TERN-201 Product-by-TERN-201 Product basis upon 180 days prior written notice. Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement if we, our affiliates or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents.
THR-β Agonist Assignment Agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd.
In June 2019, we entered into an assignment agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd., or Vintagence, pursuant to which Vintagence assigned to us certain worldwide intellectual property rights and know-how directed to THR-β agonists. In particular, we have been assigned all rights, title and interest in and to a Chinese patent application and any patents or patent applications resulting or derived therefrom in any country, know-how, and potentially certain other patents or patent applications relating to our THR-β program. We are also entitled to license the rights granted to us under the assignment agreement to our affiliates, licensees or contractors. We will be responsible for all regulatory activities, including the obtaining of regulatory approvals for a product. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on the assigned intellectual property in each of several major market territories.
During the term of the assignment agreement, Vintagence and its affiliates may not develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound covered by any of the assigned patent rights. In the event Vintagence develops a THR-β agonist not covered by the assigned patent rights, we will have the first right (but no obligation) to negotiate an assignment or license to exclusively develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit such agonist worldwide.
As initial consideration for the assignment, we paid Vintagence an upfront payment of CNY 5 million ($0.7 million). As additional consideration, we are required to pay Vintagence up to an aggregate of CNY 205 million (approximately $32 million) upon the achievement of specified developmental, clinical and regulatory milestone events with respect to products covered by the agreement.
We have the sole responsibility and decision-making authority to prosecute the assigned patents. However, if we decline to pay the prosecution costs for any assigned patent, Vintagence shall have the right to prosecute such assigned patent. If Vintagence takes over prosecution of such assigned patent, we must assign such assigned patent back to Vintagence. We also have the first right (but no obligation) to enforce the assigned patents and know-how. If we do not take any steps to enforce any of the assigned patents or know-how against any infringing third party, Vintagence has the right to take any actions necessary to abate such infringement.
 The assignment agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until we have paid all milestone payments. We may terminate the assignment agreement in its entirety or on a covered product-by-covered product and country-by-country basis without cause with 60 days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the assignment agreement for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 90 days or for the other party’s bankruptcy, insolvency or similar arrangement for the benefit of creditors. If we terminate the assignment agreement without cause or if Vintagence terminates the assignment agreement for our uncured material breach, we must transfer the assigned intellectual property back to Vintagence.
TRN-000632 Exclusive Option and License Agreement with Hansoh Pharmaceuticals
In July 2020, we, along with our subsidiaries, CaspianTern LLC and Terns, Inc., entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Hansoh pursuant to which we granted an exclusive option to Hansoh to obtain an exclusive, sub-licensable and royalty-bearing license under certain patent and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us, including patents claiming the composition of TRN-000632, our small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, and methods of using the same, to research, develop, manufacture, use, distribute, sell and otherwise exploit therapeutic products containing TRN-000632, or Hansoh Products, for all prophylactic, palliative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses in human diseases and disorders in the field of oncology in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, or the Hansoh Territory. In November 2021, Hansoh exercised its option to in-license TRN-000632 in accordance with the terms of the exclusive option and license agreement. We retain co-exclusive rights under certain know-how licensed to Hansoh and all rights under the patent rights outside of the field of oncology and Hansoh Territory. At our request, the parties will enter into a manufacturing and technology transfer agreement under which Hansoh will provide technical assistance and support related to the manufacture of Hansoh Products containing TRN-000632 as the sole active ingredient, at our cost. Pursuant to the terms of the option and license agreement, Hansoh must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a Hansoh Product in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh may not exploit any other product in the Hansoh Territory with the same primary mechanism of action as the Hansoh Products.

As consideration for the exclusive option, we received an upfront, refundable payment of $1 million, which became non-refundable upon Hansoh’s exercise of its option in November 2021. Under the license, Hansoh has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $67.0 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the Hansoh Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under this option and license agreement. Hansoh must also pay us royalties of a mid-single digit percentage on net sales of all Hansoh Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on generic competition to the Hansoh Products and royalties paid to any third party under a license to such third party’s rights necessary to commercialize a Hansoh Product. The royalty term will terminate on a Hansoh Product-by-Hansoh Product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such Hansoh Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such Hansoh Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Hansoh Product in such country.
Intellectual property developed out of the activities under this option and license agreement, and that is necessary or useful to exploit TRN-000632 or Hansoh Products, solely developed by one party shall be owned by that party, and jointly-developed intellectual property shall be jointly-owned. Hansoh will have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patent rights in the Hansoh Territory.
The option and license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Hansoh Products in the Hansoh Territory. Upon expiration of the option and license agreement, the license under our know-how granted to Hansoh shall be considered fully paid-up, perpetual and co-exclusive. Either we or Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Hansoh may also terminate the option and license agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain change of control events. If Hansoh terminates the option and license agreement upon such change of control events, we must negotiate with Hansoh the terms of an assignment of our entire right, title and interest in and to TRN-000632 and the Hansoh Products, including all intellectual property rights therein, in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh shall provide us the fair market value of such assignment.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Among others, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our drug and combination therapy candidates. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.


The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; 
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.

After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may contain limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may also designate a product candidate as a “Breakthrough Therapy” if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA for a product candidate is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.

In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our drug and combination therapy candidates as appropriate.
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or untitled letters; 
 •clinical holds on clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 


•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, “dear doctor” letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.

The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Foreign Government Regulation
Our product candidates will be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by jurisdictions outside of the United States, and, in particular, the European Union, or EU, which may include, for instance, applicable clinical trial, marketing authorization and post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign jurisdictions. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Regulations Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products in the EU
Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
  Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.

While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorization
 In order to market our future product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:
•“centralized MAs,” which are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicinal products, and (iv) medicinal products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for any products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which the granting of a MA would be in the interest of public health in the EU; and 
 •“national MAs,” which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Adaptive pathways
 The EMA has adaptive pathways programs which allow for early and progressive patient access to a medicine. The adaptive pathways concept is an approach to medicines approval that aims to improve patients’ access to medicines which have potential to address unmet medical needs. To achieve this goal, several approaches are envisaged: identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable; making more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data; and involving health technology assessment bodies early in development to increase the chance that medicines will be recommended for payment and ultimately covered by national healthcare systems. The adaptive pathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large clinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; compassionate use; the conditional approval mechanism (for medicines addressing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases or rare diseases); patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of real-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine.
The adaptive pathways program does not change the standards for the evaluation of benefits and risks or the requirement to demonstrate a positive benefit-risk balance to obtain MA.
PRIME scheme
 In July 2016, the EMA launched the PRIME scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the Committee for Medicinal Product candidates for Human Use before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify product candidates for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
Data and marketing exclusivity
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, or reference medicinal products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.


Post-approval requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 Failure to comply with the aforementioned EU and member state laws may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Government Drug Price Reporting
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B drug pricing program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule program, and other governmental drug pricing programs require participating manufacturers to report certain product and pricing data to the government. Pricing calculations vary among products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. Manufacturers may be held liable for errors associated with submission of data under these programs, including potential civil monetary penalties per item of falsely reported or misrepresented drug pricing information. Such failure also could be grounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Further, a growing number of states have enacted drug price transparency laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information to certain state agencies and other parties. Many of these laws provide for civil monetary penalties and other enforcement mechanisms if manufacturers are found to have violated requirements.
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the ACA has been challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times since its enactment. While the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2030 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020 through July 1, 2021 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30, 2022). Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Build Back Better Act, if enacted, would introduce substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, and the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D. If the Build Back Better Act is not enacted, similar or other drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation.
 In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Employees and Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 41 employees, all of whom were full-time, all of whom are engaged in research and development activities, operations, or finance and administration. 14 of our employees hold doctorate degrees (Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D.). None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Our key human capital management objectives include, among others: (i) attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) providing opportunities for learning, development, career growth, and movement within our company; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional, and financial health of team members; (v) obtaining team member feedback; (vi) maintaining and enhancing our culture and mission; and (vii) communicating with our board of directors on a routine basis on key topics. We have implemented and continue to develop many programs designed to achieve these priorities.
