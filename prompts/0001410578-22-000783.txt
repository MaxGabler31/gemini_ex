ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Organizational Development
Petros was organized as a Delaware corporation on May 14, 2020 for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 17, 2020 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Petros, Neurotrope, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Neurotrope”), PM Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 1”), PN Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 2”), and Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Metuchen”). The Merger Agreement provided for (1) the merger of Merger Sub 1, with and into Metuchen, with Metuchen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Metuchen Merger”) and (2) the merger of Merger Sub 2 with and into Neurotrope, with Neurotrope surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Neurotrope Merger” and together with the Metuchen Merger, the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, Metuchen and Neurotrope became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Petros, and Petros became a publicly traded corporation on December 1, 2020.
On December 7, 2020, Neurotrope completed the spin-off of certain assets, whereby (i) any cash in excess of $20,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, and all of the operating assets and liabilities of Neurotrope not retained by Neurotrope in connection with the Mergers were contributed to Synaptogenix, Inc. (formerly known as Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neurotrope prior to the spin-off), a Delaware corporation (“Synaptogenix”) and (ii) holders of record of Neurotrope common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, Neurotrope preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share and certain warrants as of November 30, 2020 received a pro rata distribution of common stock of Synaptogenix, resulting in a separate, independent publicly traded company.
Business Model and Primary Marketed Products
Petros is a pharmaceutical company focused on men’s health therapeutics with a full range of commercial capabilities including sales, marketing, regulatory and medical affairs, finance, trade relations, pharmacovigilance, market access relations, manufacturing, and distribution.
Petros consists of wholly owned subsidiaries, Metuchen, Neurotrope, Timm Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Timm Medical”), and Pos-T-Vac, LLC (“PTV”). We are engaged in the commercialization and development of Stendra®, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved PDE-5 inhibitor prescription medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which we have licensed from Vivus, Inc. (“Vivus”). Petros also markets its own line of ED products in the form of vacuum erection device products through its subsidiaries, Timm Medical and PTV. In addition to ED products, we have acquired an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize H100™, a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease.
Stendra®
Stendra® is an FDA approved PDE-5 inhibitor prescription medication for the treatment of ED and is the only patent-protected PDE-5 inhibitor on the market. As a distinct molecule with high in-vitro affinity and selectivity for penile tissue (clinical significance of this in-vitro selectivity profile is unknown), Stendra® offers the ED therapeutic landscape a valuable addition as an oral ED therapy that may be taken once daily as early as approximately 15 minutes prior to sexual engagement, with or without food when using the 100mg or 200mg dosing (does not apply to 50mg dosing) , subject to certain contraindications and limitations common among PDE-5 inhibitors. For example, Stendra® is contraindicated for, and may cause hypotension when used by, individuals who take medicines called “nitrates,” alpha-blockers, or other antihypertensives or who have consumed a substantial amount of alcohol (e.g., more than three glasses of wine or three shots of whiskey).

On September 30, 2016, we acquired from Vivus all of the rights to license, develop, market, sell, and distribute the drug avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) in the United States, Canada, South America, and India, including all assets related to, or necessary for, the exercise of such rights, such as licenses, trademarks, and intellectual property rights. The drug avanafil was initially developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”) and MTPC licensed the rights to avanafil to Vivus in December 2000 (the “MPTC License”). Stendra® (avanafil) was approved by the FDA in April 2012. Petros seeks to make Stendra® the first oral ED prescription therapy available as a (nonprescription) over-the-counter (“OTC”) option in the United States (referred to as an “Rx-to-OTC switch”). To that end, Petros has conducted two label comprehension studies (which are non-clinical consumer studies intended to assess whether consumers understand key elements of an OTC drug label, namely instructions for use, contraindications, in-use warnings, and precautions), announcing the completion of Phase I and Phase II in July and December 2021, respectively. Petros also announced the initiation of two “self-selection” studies in January 2022—one of which includes participants from the general population and the other is specific to nitrate-medicine users (a patient group of particular interest to the FDA). In these self-selection studies, individuals who are interested in utilizing an OTC ED product are recruited to review the draft OTC labeling for Stendra® and determine whether the product is, or is not, appropriate for them to use without the intervention of a healthcare professional. Petros intends to share data from these studies with the FDA in a pre-IND meeting that Petros hopes to have during the first half of 2022 but which has not-yet been scheduled.
Vacuum Erection Devices (“VEDs”)
Petros also markets its own line of medical devices intended for ED treatment through its subsidiaries, Timm Medical and PTV, including the VED systems marketed as the “Osbon ErecAid” and “PosTVac.”. We plan to continue to grow the VED business both domestically and internationally. Petros believes that its potential domestic growth will come through the expansion of its distribution partner network, which currently includes national distributors such as SunMed and Vitalit and internationally through distributors such as Heize (Germany), Mediplus (UK), Euromedical (Spain), as well as a growing number of regional small-business distributors specialized in the urology landscape. Additionally, Petros intends to continue to leverage existing relationships with key clinician decision makers, offering direct purchase agreements for Centers of Excellence in prostate cancer and sexual health rehabilitation. This will allow for increased local purchase availability for consumers. We believe that potential international growth will come through additional work with existing customers to expand our current base of business while also working to unlock new international territories. In addition to expanding the distribution network, Petros is pursuing better use of the historical clinical data available regarding VEDs.
H100™
In addition to its ED products, Petros is committed to identifying and developing other pharmaceuticals to advance men’s health. In March 2020, we acquired an exclusive global license (the “Hybrid License”) to H100™ from Hybrid Medical LLC (“Hybrid”). H100™ is a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease. Peyronie’s disease is a condition that occurs upon penile tissue disruption often caused by sexual activity or injury, healing into collagen-based scars that may ultimately harden and cause penile deformity. Peyronie’s disease may affect millions of men around the world, and there is no approved non-invasive treatment option. Based on current approved therapies, if approved, as of this date H100™ would become the first and only clinically approved topical non-invasive formulation for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease.
On September 24, 2020, the Company and Hybrid entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which the term of the Hybrid License was extended for an additional six months to March 24, 2021. In consideration for the extension, the Company paid Hybrid $50,000 in October 2020 and an additional $100,000 in December 2020. On March 31, 2021, the Company and Hybrid, entered into a second letter agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to extend the Second Period (as defined in the Hybrid License) for an additional six (6) months to September 24, 2021. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay Hybrid a one-time, non-creditable and non-refundable payment of $200,000, which was paid within seven calendar days of entering into the agreement. On September 24, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement in which the Company exercised its right not to terminate the Hybrid License even though orphan drug status had not yet been granted by the FDA. Along with this election, the Company paid Hybrid $150,000 on October 1, 2021, $200,000 on October 31, 2021, $200,000 on December 1, 2021, and $200,000 on December 23, 2021.
Petros has established its foundation for growth and, with the addition of H100™ to the product portfolio and other pipeline opportunities for additional products, Petros believes that it can build an industry leading men’s health pharmaceutical company. Petros has no other product candidates and no other definitive license agreements at this time. However, Petros is engaged in discussions with viable, late-stage therapeutic assets addressing male hormone replacement therapy, male infertility, BPH and prostate cancer, but has not entered into any binding agreements with respect thereto.

Manufacturing and Supply
Petros currently only has facilities to assemble its VED products, and therefore must rely on qualified third-party contract manufactures with appropriate facilities and equipment to contract manufacture commercial quantities of its products. If, for any reason, Petros’ contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, it may be required to replace them. Although Petros believes there are a number of potential replacements, it may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.
Petros obtains from third parties the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture its products, including the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in its products. Until recently, Petros has relied on Vivus to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) necessary for the manufacture of Stendra® pursuant to a commercial supply agreement executed on September 30, 2016 (the “Vivus Supply Agreement”), which required Petros to purchase certain minimum quantities of Stendra® in each year of the Vivus Supply Agreement term. The Vivus Supply Agreement was terminated by Petros effective September 30, 2021. On January 18, 2022, Petros (through its wholly-owned subsidiary) and Vivus entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Vivus Settlement Agreement”) related to the minimum purchase requirements under the Vivus Supply Agreement in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and certain reimbursement rights asserted by a third-party retailer in connection with quantities of the Company’s Stendra® product that were delivered to the third-party retailer and later returned. In connection with the Vivus Settlement Agreement, Petros retained approximately $7.3 million of API inventory (representing the 2018 and 2019 minimum purchase requirements) out of approximately $12.4 million due under the Vivus Supply Agreement, in conjunction with forgiveness of approximately $4.25 million of current liabilities relating to returned goods and minimum purchase commitments. In exchange for the API and reduction of current liabilities, Petros executed an interest-bearing promissory note in favor of Vivus in the principal amount of $10,201,758 (the “Note”). The parties also entered into a Security Agreement to secure Petros’ obligations under the promissory note. The Company will record the impact of this transaction, including the expected gain in the first quarter of 2022.
In addition to the payments to be made in accordance with the Note, the Company further agreed in the Vivus Settlement Agreement to (i) grant to Vivus a right of first refusal to provide certain types of debt and convertible equity (but not preferred equity) financing issued by or to Metuchen (including any subsidiaries and intermediaries) until the Note is paid in full, and (ii) undertake to make certain regulatory submissions to effectuate Vivus’ ability to exercise its rights under the License Agreement. On January 18, 2022, the Company made a prepayment of the obligations under the Note in the amount of $900,000, and a payment of $1,542,904 with respect to a purchase order entered into in 2021 to Vivus. In consideration of these payments and upon the Company’s satisfaction of certain regulatory submissions Vivus released 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Company’s existing open purchase order (the “Open Purchase Order”) being held by Vivus, which represents approximately a six-month supply of inventory. Under the Vivus Settlement Agreement Vivus also agreed to release the remaining 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Open Purchase Order upon the Company’s satisfaction of the remaining regulatory submission requirements (not to exceed 180 days from the date of the Vivus Settlement Agreement). The Vivus Settlement Agreement stipulated that Vivus is the sole owner of all API unless or until such time as certain quantities of API are shipped to the Company upon the fulfillment of the aforementioned payment conditions.
Following the termination of the Vivus Supply Agreement, Petros, through its subsidiary Metuchen, entered into a Technology Transfer Service Agreement on January 20, 2022, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., part of Thermo Fisher Scientific (“Patheon”), pursuant to which the Company and Patheon agreed to collaborate as strategic partners for commercial production of Stendra® tablets at Patheon’s facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. Under the Agreement, Patheon or one of its affiliates will provide pharmaceutical development and technology transfer services in order to establish and validate its ability to manufacture supply of the Company’s Stendra® product. Any commercial sale of product manufactured during the performance of the Agreement must be subject to a subsequent commercial manufacturing services agreement (with associated quality agreement) between the parties before it can be offered for commercial sale.
Petros is required to identify the supplier of all the raw materials for all FDA-approved products that it acquires from others. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, Petros would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA and depending on the supplier, provide the FDA with notice or receive FDA approval for the supplier, which would likely delay or interrupt manufacturing of the affected product.

Distribution and Marketing
Petros has distribution agreements with the three largest pharmaceutical distributors (McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”), Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”), and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”)), as well as a direct purchase program for designated retail dispensing pharmacies within large urology group practices, enabling us to provide Stendra® to customers through most retail pharmacies in the United States. Petros currently depends on McKesson to service these pharmaceutical distribution agreements. McKesson, on an exclusive basis, provides distribution of Stendra® to its own retail pharmacies and handles Petros’ distribution to Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen.
In addition to established nationwide distribution mechanisms, Petros also collaborates with several commercial insurance entities with contracted access to Stendra® and enduring capabilities to expand these commercial insurance relationships for future assets. Although commercial insurance collaboration and contracts remain an important factor in patient access and affordability, Medicare and Medicaid remain largely out of scope for Stendra® and most sexual dysfunction therapies. As with many sexual dysfunction therapeutics, Medicare and Medicaid do not normally contract or reimburse for these therapies unless concomitantly indicated for other ailments beyond sexual dysfunction considered medically necessary. Nevertheless, commercial insurance access remains competitive and widely available for Stendra®.
Petros relies on a variety of channels to market and sell its products, including:

● | employee and third-party contracted sales representatives who promote Stendra® directly to high-volume physician prescribers of ED therapies and target physicians at trade associations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | online digital strategies, including search engine optimization and targeted advertisements, target physicians and consumers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | targeting of managed care organizations to deliver value-based contracts and improve placement for Stendra® on approved drug lists;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | collaboration with specialty pharmacies that provide personalized service to physicians and patients, including discreet shipping to patients’ homes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | direct marketing of our medical devices to urology offices domestically and internationally.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
We generate a significant amount of sales from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, five customers accounted for approximately 89% of our consolidated gross sales, and five collectively accounted for approximately 98% of Stendra® gross sales. For further information refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
According to data provided by IQVIA, the oral ED market (specifically the PDE-5 inhibitor class) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years especially, with a 26% increase in prescriptions (filled in pharmacies) in 2020 vs. 2019, and with 2021 increasing in oral ED prescriptions by 20% over 2020. As generic options have become available, they have led the growth in prescription volume with an enduring presence of branded prescription volume, indicating durable brand loyalty and value. Stendra® remains the only patent protected brand among the PDE-5 inhibitor class. According to Arizton Advisory and Intelligence Erectile Dysfunction Market Reports, the trajectory of growth in this class is projected to continue to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 8% through 2023. We expect that North America will remain the lead market in this growth due to its established healthcare landscape and the prominence of comorbid conditions associated with ED.
Employees
Our Board of Directors oversees our employee relations programs as it views building our culture – from employee development and retention to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives – as key to driving long-term value for our business and helping to mitigate risks.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 full time employees, all of whom were based inside the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Government Regulation
Pharmaceutical products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our pharmaceutical products.
Regulation in the United States
Drug Development and Approval Process
To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, sponsors must, among other requirements, submit extensive data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling and packaging. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and sponsors may encounter significant difficulties or costs in their efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude them from marketing their developed drug candidates.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves some or all of the following key steps:

● | completion of nonclinical studies, such as laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, performed in compliance with FDA regulations for good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a NDA to the FDA along with payment of the application user fee and FDA acceptance of that NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) in order to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possible inspection of selected clinical study sites to confirm compliance with GCP requirements and data integrity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, if applicable, which must occur prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
After a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Preclinical tests intended for submission to the FDA to support the safety of a product candidate must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. A drug sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which is a prerequisite to initiating clinical testing on human subjects in the United States.
Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will include one or more clinical protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects.
The clinical investigation of an investigational new drug is divided into three phases that typically are conducted sequentially but may overlap or be combined. The three phases are as follows:

● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes initial clinical trials introducing an investigational new drug into humans and may be conducted in subjects with the target disease or healthy volunteers. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication or indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of subjects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are typically large trials performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug candidate has been obtained. They are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product marketing approval. Phase 3 trials usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.

6



Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product or therapeutic candidate. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, via a clinical hold, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board (“IRB”) is responsible for ensuring that human subjects in clinical studies are protected from inappropriate study risks. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The IRB also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or if the investigational new drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new drug candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of “Phase 4” clinical trials. Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA Submission Under 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2)
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for prescription drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.

7



Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from receipt in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a drug that is not a new molecular entity, and six months from the receipt date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. As a result, the NDA review process can be very lengthy. Most innovative drug products (other than biological products) obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, commonly referred to as a traditional (or full) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature and/or the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product and to support the reliance on the applicable published literature or referenced product, which is referred to as “bridging.” The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, if such approval is supported by study data. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product’s label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs it receives, whether submitted under Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2), to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of independent experts for a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving the NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements and to assure the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money, and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
The FDA also may require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or “REMS,” if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor must include a proposed REMS within its NDA submission.

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities where the drug product or its API will be produced and the clinical trial sites, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or, in some cases, a complete response letter (“CRL”) that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the agency. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor (e.g., requiring labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). After receiving a CRL, an applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. FDA will issue a letter within 30 days of an NDA resubmission acknowledging receipt and informing the applicant as follows. For resubmissions deemed to be complete responses to all deficiencies identified in the CRL, such letter will contain FDA’s designation of the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 (based on the nature of information received therein) and the corresponding due date by which it will take action (2 months for Class 1 resubmissions and 6 months for Class 2. If FDA does not find the resubmission to be a complete response to all CRL deficiencies, the FDA will inform the applicant, and the FDA’s “review clock” will not start until a complete response is received.
Even if a drug product receives NDA approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages and/or subject to limitations, specific labeling requirements, and/or other conditions that must be met to lawfully market the product in the United States, any or all of which could restrict the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, and/or precautions be included in the product’s labeling. The FDA may also impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Stendra® was approved via a traditional NDA in April 2012 for prescription-only use in treating ED. The approved NDA contains numerous contraindications, warnings, and risks, as well as instruction regarding when to seek help from a healthcare professional, among other things. In connection with our OTC strategy, we have over three years invested in the program and several key studies completed, our next steps include a pre-IND with FDA. Petros has, and intends to continue to, self-fund their OTC initiative.
Petros also currently plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for H100™ for treatment of Peyronie’s disease, which will allow Petros to rely, in part, on published scientific literature and/or the FDA’s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of certain approved drug products. If the FDA disagrees with the appropriateness of reliance on a reference listed drug or published literature or if Petros is not otherwise able to bridge to the reference listed drug or published literature, it may need to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies, which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays or to the termination of the development program. If Petros is unable to obtain approval for H100™ through the 505(b)(2) NDA process, it may be required to pursue the traditional NDA process, which is more expensive and time consuming.
Post-Approval Requirements for Prescription Drugs
Following approval of a new drug product, the sponsor and the product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, and promotion and advertising requirements.
Promotional communications must be carefully crafted to ensure compliance with all applicable FDA regulations pertaining to prescription-drug marketing and labeling. In particular, prescription-drug advertisements must generally (1) not be false or misleading, (2) present a “fair balance” of information describing both the risks and benefits associated with the drug, (3) include facts that are “material” to the product’s advertised uses, and (4) include a “brief summary” that mentions every risk described in the product’s labeling. Further, where the intended use of a prescription drug differs from the intended use approved by FDA, as listed in the product’s approved NDA, FDA has asserted that the product is an unapproved “new drug” and taken enforcement action against sponsors for introducing such unapproved new drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the FDCA. This prohibited practice is also called “off-label” promotion. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, sponsors may not legally market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

9



To market an approved drug product for a new indication (i.e., beyond and/or differing from that set forth in the approved NDA), the sponsor must submit a new NDA (or NDA supplement under the traditional pathway (505(b)(1)) or the 505(b)(2) pathway where the circumstances allow), which, in many cases, will require the completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. There is no guarantee that FDA will approve an NDA seeking an expansion of an approved drug’s labeling and/or indications for use more quickly than an NDA involving a novel product (i.e., that has never been approved for any indication) or ever. Relatedly, if the sponsor (or a contractor, partner, or other affiliated party) makes any post-market modifications to an approved drug or the production thereof, including changes in labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, among other things, it may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement.
In addition, FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved drug product. Accordingly, both sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort on systems relating to production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance, and to ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FDCA.
The FDA may withdraw its approval for a drug product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or unexpected problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS.
Petros and/or its present or future suppliers, contract manufacturers, and/or other affiliates involved in one or more of its U.S. commercialization activities may not be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements. For example, Petros may believe that its manufacturing operations (including that of its contractors, as applicable) are fully compliant with cGMPs or that all promotional communications disseminated by or on behalf of Petros are consistent with FDA’s prescription-drug marketing requirements, but the FDA may determine otherwise. Petros could be subject to a number of adverse enforcement actions and/or penalties in connection with any failure(s) to comply with the FDCA and/or its implementing regulations, including, but not limited to, the following:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of approved products, market withdrawal, recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters, public warnings, consumer advisories, “dear doctor” letters, and other similar publications or issuances;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | seizure, detention, import alerts;
--+-----------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.

FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, unless exempt. A Class III product is a product which has a new intended use or uses advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Petros’ current medical devices are classified Class II medical devices.
When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either: a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, and for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the United States. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained.
The FDA classifies Petros’ VEDs as Class II external penile rigidity devices, which, as of 2004, are exempt from the 510(k)-notification process, as long as all detailed special controls FDA has established for this product category are met. Petros’ VEDs, on the other hand, were introduced into the U.S. market pursuant to the 510(k) notification process before the FDA established the 510(k) exemption for external penile rigidity devices that meet applicable special controls. Accordingly, Petros’ VEDs may be lawfully marketed in accordance with their respective 510(k) summaries, rather than the special controls currently in-place for external penile rigidity devices marketed without 510(k) clearance. However, to the extent any modifications are made or the VEDs are marketed beyond the scope of their respective 510(k) summaries, they must comply with the applicable special controls.
Post-Market Requirements for Medical Devices
Numerous post-market regulatory requirements apply to medical devices, including, but not limited to:

● | the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared or PMA-approved devices that could affect safety or effectiveness;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to deaths or serious injuries or malfunctioned in ways that would likely cause or contribute to deaths or serious injuries if the malfunctions were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require the manufacturers to report to the FDA corrections and removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the devices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The manufacturing of Petros’ VEDs must comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Further, Petros’ records and manufacturing processes (and/or the records and manufacturing processes of the subsidiaries through which the VEDs are marketed) are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Any failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, the VED-manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of the VEDs.
Regulation of Third-Party Contract Manufacturers
Third-party contract manufacturers that Petros relies on to manufacture commercial quantities of its products are also subject to cGMPs and/or the FDA’s QSR regulations, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies perform ongoing periodic unannounced inspections to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs/QSR and other applicable government regulations. Prior to approving a marketing application, manufacturers will also need to validate their manufacturing process. The FDA will also inspect the proposed manufacturing facilities to confirm that they can produce products meeting the FDA’s regulatory standards.
Intellectual Property
Petros relies on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Petros’ rights to market, distribute and sell avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) are granted under a License and Commercialization Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Vivus entered into on September 30, 2016, which is a sublicense under Vivus’ license agreement with the owner of the Stendra® patent, MTPC (the “MTPC License”). The MTPC License contains certain termination rights that would allow MTPC to terminate the agreement if Vivus were to breach any of the terms of the MTPC License or become insolvent or bankrupt. In the event that MTPC terminates the MTPC License with Vivus because of any contractual breach, Petros has step-in rights with MTPC, which would allow Petros to continue to sell Stendra®. In March 2020, we acquired the Hybrid License for the development and commercialization of H100™. H100™ is a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease. The Hybrid License relates to three US patents and two European patents directed to the formulation and use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. U.S. Patent 9,333,242 contains claims directed to a transdermal gel composition containing the unique formulation of H100™. U.S. Patent 9,238,059 contains claims directed to a method for inhibiting or treating Peyronie’s disease, comprising topically administering to a portion of penile dermis of a human with Peyronie’s disease an effective amount of a gel composition containing the formulation of H100™. Additionally, U.S. Patent 10,471,131 contains further formulation claims and method of treatment claims directed to the use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. There are two corresponding European Patents (EP3269372B and EP2804606B) that have similar corresponding issued claims. The Hybrid License terminates upon the expiration of the latest patent noted above.
Upon entering the Hybrid License, we paid an initial license fee of $100,000 and additional payments of $250,000, and we will pay to Hybrid additional annual milestone payments of $125,000, $150,000 and $200,000 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the entry into the Hybrid License, and $250,000 annual milestone payments for each year thereafter. We are also required to make a $1,000,000 payment upon the first commercial sale and are required to make additional payments on a sliding scale of percentages of net sales in the low single digits. Annual anniversary payments will not be required after commercialization. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments between 3-6% of any net sales. We also expect to incur approximately $14 million of research and development expenses relating to H100™ over the estimated four to six-year period of clinical development prior to FDA approval, including approximately $10 million for clinical trials and $4 million of other expenses.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors when evaluating Petros. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Petros’ Capital Requirements and Financing
Petros has incurred significant losses and may continue to experience losses in the future.
Petros had a net loss of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a net loss of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, Petros used funds in operations of approximately $11.9 million and had an accumulated deficit of $70.7 million. While Petros had available cash of $23.8 million at December 31, 2021, it cannot predict if it will achieve profitability soon or at all. Petros expects to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on, among other things:

● | sales and marketing;
--+---------------------


● | investments in hiring key personnel;
--+-------------------------------------


● | possible development, regulatory approval and commercialization of H100™ for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease and our OTC strategies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Petros may not generate sufficient revenue to offset such costs to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. Petros expects to continue to invest in its operations and product and business development to maintain and grow its current market position and to meet its expanded reporting and compliance obligations as a public company.
Petros expects its operating losses to continue in the near term in order to carry out its strategic objectives. Petros considers historical operating results, capital resources and financial position, and current projections and estimates as part of its plan to fund operations over a reasonable period of time. Petros believes that based on these factors, along with our projections for 2022, that the available cash on hand is sufficient to fund its operations through at least March, 31, 2023, however for periods after March 31, 2023, the Company may need to raise additional funds or curtail certain discretionary expenditures in order to maintain an appropriate level of cash to fund our operations.
We expect to require additional capital in the future in order to develop our products, fund operations, and otherwise implement our business strategy. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, it may be difficult to effectively realize our long-term strategic goals and objectives.
We will require additional financing to further develop and market our products, fund operations, and otherwise implement our business strategy. Our current cash resources will not be sufficient to fund these activities. We are exploring additional ways to raise capital, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise capital. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies.

13



Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our stockholders’ ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.
The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
Petros’ consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets.
Petros’ intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face risks for impairment and charges related to such assets, which may be significant. If we are unable to meet our revenue projections we will have an impairment to our intangible assets.
Risks Related to Petros’ Business, Industry and Operations
The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Petros’ operations, and the operations of its partners, suppliers and logistics providers, could significantly disrupt its operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions.
Petros’ business could be adversely impacted by the effects of the coronavirus or other epidemics. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and the risks to the international community. The WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and since that time many of the previously imposed restrictions and other measures which were instituted in response have been subsequently reduced or lifted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic, and its duration and extent continue to be dependent on various developments, such as the emergence of variants to the virus that may cause additional strains of COVID-19, the administration and ultimate effectiveness of vaccines, and the eventual timeline to achieve a sufficient level of herd immunity among the general population. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable future. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of any new variants, such as the Delta and the Omicron variants, will have on its financial results, and the Company may experience a material adverse impact on its sales, results of operations, and cash flows in fiscal 2022 and beyond.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a shift from in-person sales to online, telehealth-based sales. These online sales generally have lower gross margins than in-person sales, which has impacted our net revenues. Additionally, Petros expects that COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact the status and progress of our development programs, including any clinical and preclinical trials for H100™ or any other product candidates. Delays or other difficulties in completing clinical and preclinical trials could result in a longer period of time to obtain product regulatory approval, to commercialize our products, if approved, and realize any resulting revenue in the future.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the government and public health response continues to rapidly evolve. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has issued a number of new guidance documents. Additionally, in March 2020, the US Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which, for certain critical drugs, includes strengthened provisions regarding required FDA drug shortage reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing.

14



Petros is actively assessing and responding where possible to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts its business, including its operations, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus pandemic. The continued spread of the coronavirus globally could materially and adversely impact Petros’ business including without limitation, supply chain and manufacturing matters, employee health, workforce productivity, increased insurance premiums, limitations on travel, the availability of industry advisers and personnel, and other factors that will depend on future developments beyond its control, which may have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of, or a significant shortfall in demand from, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
We generate a significant amount of sales from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, five customers accounted for approximately 89% of our consolidated gross sales, and five main customers collectively accounted for approximately 98% of Stendra® gross sales. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues in future periods. However, these customers or any of our other customers may not continue to purchase our products at current levels, pricing, or at all, and our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the success of our competitors’ products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our largest customers. We have not entered into purchase agreements with any of these customers, and therefore, these customers are not subject to minimum purchase orders or have any contractual obligations to purchase our products. If we were to lose one of our key customers or have a key customer significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our revenues may be materially reduced, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and cash flows and projections.
Petros recorded net sales of approximately $4.6 million of Stendra® in 2021, which accounted for 59.0% of Petros’ total revenues in 2021.
The success of Petros’ business currently depends on the successful continued commercialization of its main product, Stendra®, which is marketed, distributed and sold under a license agreement from Vivus. Petros may not be successful in commercializing Stendra® beyond its current level. Additionally, if Stendra® were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection, changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures, supply shortages or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, there would be an adverse impact on Petros’ revenues, which could be significant.

15



Petros is subject to ongoing obligations under a settlement agreement relating to the termination of a commercial supply agreement with Vivus.
On January 18, 2022, Petros (through its wholly-owned subsidiary) and Vivus entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Vivus Settlement Agreement”) related to the minimum purchase requirements under the Vivus Supply Agreement in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and certain reimbursement rights asserted by a third-party retailer in connection with quantities of the Company’s Stendra® product that were delivered to the third-party retailer and later returned. In connection with the Vivus Settlement Agreement, Petros executed an interest-bearing promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of Vivus in the principal amount of $10,201,758. The parties also entered into a Security Agreement to secure Petros’ obligations under the Note. In addition to the payments to be made in accordance with the Note, the Company further agreed in the Vivus Settlement Agreement to (i) grant to Vivus a right of first refusal to provide certain types of debt and convertible equity (but not preferred equity) financing issued by or to Metuchen (including any subsidiaries and intermediaries) until the Note is paid in full, and (ii) undertake to make certain regulatory submissions to effectuate Vivus’ ability to exercise its rights under the License Agreement. On January 18, 2022, the Company made a prepayment of the obligations under the Note in the amount of $900,000 and a payment of $1,542,904 with respect to the purchase order made in 2021 to Vivus. In consideration of these payments and upon the Company’s satisfaction of certain regulatory submissions Vivus released 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Company’s existing open purchase order (the “Open Purchase Order”) being held by Vivus, which represents approximately a six-month supply of inventory. Under the Vivus Settlement Agreement Vivus also agreed to release the remaining 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Open Purchase Order upon the Company’s satisfaction of the remaining regulatory submission requirements (not to exceed 180 days from the date of the Vivus Settlement Agreement). If Petros fails to make any of the required payments under the Vivus Settlement Agreement or the Note, or if Petros fails to successfully execute the required regulatory submissions, it may be unable to obtain sufficient quantity of Stendra® API to meet market demand. The Company will record the impact of this transaction, including the expected gain in the first quarter of 2022.
Pursuant to the Vivus Settlement Agreement, the parties also executed an Amendment No. 1 to the License Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment provides that Vivus shall retain its co-exclusive right along with the Company to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit the Stendra® product in the territory covered by the License Agreement, provided that Vivus shall not exercise such right unless an Event of Default occurs under the Vivus Settlement Agreement, the Note, or the Security Agreement. The Amendment further provides that, upon such an Event of Default, the License Agreement will terminate and Vivus will have the right to use all regulatory documentation and submissions of Metuchen and other rights as may be necessary for Vivus to exercise its right to exploit the Stendra® product. The Amendment also acknowledges that Metuchen has assigned its rights under the License Agreement to Vivus as a “financing entity” and provides that such rights may be assigned in certain circumstances. If the Company fails to perform its obligations under the Vivus Settlement Agreement or the amended License Agreement, the Company may forfeit its rights under the License Agreement and be unable to exploit the Stendra® product.
We may experience delays or problems in the supply of Stendra® if Patheon experiences delays in or fails to establish and validate its ability to manufacture supply of the Company’s Stendra® product, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain sufficient quantity of Stendra® API to meet market demand.
Petros, through its subsidiary Metuchen, entered into a Technology Transfer Service Agreement on January 20, 2022, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., part of Thermo Fisher Scientific (“Patheon”), pursuant to which the Company and Patheon agreed to collaborate as strategic partners for commercial production of Stendra® tablets at Patheon’s facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. Under the Agreement, Patheon or one of its affiliates will provide pharmaceutical development and technology transfer services in order to establish and validate its ability to manufacture supply of the Company’s Stendra® product. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, the finished drug product and packaging in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. Because Patheon is manufacturing Stendra for the first time, Patheon may encounter difficulties in production, such as difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, compliance with strictly enforced United States, state and non-United States regulations, and disruptions or delays caused by man-made or natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics, or other business interruptions, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic.
If Patheon encounters these or any other manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties, this may delay or prevent it from providing the Company with sufficient quantity of Stendra® tablets to meet commercial demand. In addition, if Patheon fails or refuses to supply us with Stendra® API for any reason, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to engage a new supplier.

Petros relies on a combination of several different channels to promote its products to physicians and patients in the United States and internationally.
Petros currently relies on a variety of channels to market and sell its products, including:

Petros will continue to depend on these strategies, partners and distribution channels in order to promote and sell its products. Petros cannot assure you that these strategies will enable it to successfully market and sell its products. Failure to successfully market and sell its products would have a material adverse effect on Petros’ business, financial condition and results of operations.
Petros is substantially dependent on a limited number of commercial products. Any difficulties or delays in product manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales or marketing could affect Petros’ future results.
Petros’ ability to achieve its business objectives is directly dependent on its ability to get its products to market, and any delays or difficulties in manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales or marketing could have an adverse impact, including but not limited to the following types of events:

● | failure to predict market demand for, or to gain market acceptance of, approved products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in costly and disruptive enforcement actions, or otherwise require costly and disruptive corrective actions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays, unavailability, or undetected defects with respect to product manufacturing materials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network or comply with cGMPs or other regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to establishment and maintain of adequate health care coverage and reimbursement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to establish and maintain market demand and acceptance for Petros’ products through marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote these products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to adequately train sales and marketing personnel regarding regulatory compliance matters and any exposure that Petros may face due to noncompliance of such personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to establish and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors, and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | failure to maintain supply chain integrity against intentional and criminal acts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA may determine that Petros’ products or product candidates have undesirable side effects that could result in regulatory action, impede commercialization, or delay or prevent their regulatory approval.
Undesirable side effects caused by Petros’ products or product candidates could adversely and materially harm the business. Undesirable side effects could limit Petros’ ability to commercialize the products, could result in product liability suits, and could result in regulatory actions, such as, but not limited to withdrawal of the products from the market, withdrawal of marketing approvals, safety communications or warnings, revisions to product labeling to add warnings or other precautions, or prompt regulators to require that Petros implement risk mitigation steps, such as post-approval studies, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and/or other strategies. Undesirable side effects could impact the ability of the Petros to complete product development, may require that development be limited to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, could cause Petros, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), or other reviewing entities or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Undesirable side effects caused by or any unexpected characteristics for product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in product labeling, such as limitations on the indicated uses or populations for which the products may be marketed or distributed, a label with significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings, contraindications, and precautions, a label without statements necessary or desirable for successful commercialization, or may result in requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance, or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. Should any of the foregoing occur, Petros’ business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially harmed.
Petros relies on third parties for the supply of the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture its products.
Petros is dependent on third parties for the supply of the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture its products, including the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in its products. Petros is required to identify the supplier of all the raw materials for all FDA-approved products that it acquires from others. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, Petros would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA and, depending on the supplier, provide the FDA with notice or receive FDA approval for the supplier, which would likely delay or interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. Failure of suppliers to meet the applicable regulatory standards could also result in enforcement actions against such suppliers or Petros.
These third parties include foreign suppliers. Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA regulation, various import duties, foreign currency risk and other government clearances. Acts of governments outside and within the United States may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of Petros’ products. In addition, any changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the United States may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for research and development prior to the expiration of the applicable U.S. or foreign patents.
Shortages in or interruptions in the supply of raw materials could potentially delay Petros’ development programs or result in insufficient product quantities to meet commercial demand. Third-party manufacturers’ failure to obtain the raw materials necessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of products and product candidates may have a material adverse effect on Petros’ business.

18



Changes in product or product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.
Any changes to product or product candidate manufacturing or formulation may materially impact Petros’ business. For approved products, manufacturing changes may require reporting to and/or approval from the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA. Regulatory authorities may require substantial, time consuming, and costly manufacturing work as well as studies to support such changes. Any such changes may also not accomplish the intended outcome. Additionally, changes to product candidate manufacturing during product development may also adversely impact the development program. Changes could cause product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of future studies. Such changes may also require additional testing, studies, FDA notification, or FDA approval.
Petros may experience pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability, if achieved.
Federal and state health care programs are increasingly focused on the price of prescription drugs and medical devices, including the expanded use of mandatory rebates and discounts and measures that penalize or prohibit price increases over inflation rates. Public and private third-party payers also may not consider Stendra® or our other products to be medically necessary when prescribed for ED and may decline to cover it. Recent events have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs, especially in connection with price increases following companies’ acquisitions of the rights to certain drug products. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors recently issued subpoenas to a pharmaceutical company seeking information about its drug pricing practices, among other issues, and members of the U.S. Congress have sought information from certain pharmaceutical companies relating to post-acquisition drug-price increases. Petros’ revenue and future profitability, if achieved, could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit its ability to increase the prices of its products.
Pressure from social activist groups and future government regulations may also put downward pressure on the price of drugs, which could result in downward pressure on the prices of Petros’ products in the future.
Private third-party payers and other managed care entities, such as pharmacy benefit managers, continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and control the cost of drugs and medical devices.
Consolidation among managed care organizations (“MCOs”) has increased the negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payers. Private third-party payers increasingly employ formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. Failure to obtain or maintain timely adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products, or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing, could adversely impact revenue. Private third-party payers, including self-insured employers, often implement formularies with copayment tiers to encourage utilization of certain drugs and have also been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products Managed care also establishes formularies to control the cost of medical supplies. Payers may limit the number of drugs covered in the therapeutic class or sources in supply categories, cover only generic alternatives to drugs in the class, or impose restrictions on reimbursement of a particular drug or drugs in a class or a particular medical device.
Private third-party payers are also implementing new initiatives such as “copay accumulators” (policies that provide that the value of copay assistance does not count as out-of-pocket costs that are applied toward deductibles) that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturers and patients. This cost shifting has increased consumer interest and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. As the U.S. payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.

19



Products may face competition from generic drug products and other similar drug products.
If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic or similar versions of any of Petros’ products, the sales of Petros’ products could be adversely affected. If the Stendra® NDA is approved, the product may become the “reference listed drug” in the FDA’s Orange Book. Other applicants may then seek approval of generic versions of the product through submission of ANDAs in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic applicant would not need to conduct full clinical studies. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, conditions of use and labeling, among other commonalities, as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is available at the site of action at the same rate and to the same extent as the reference listed drug. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices, and are generally preferred by third party payers. As a result, the FDA, executive administrations and Congress have taken steps to encourage increased generic drug competition in the market in an effort to bring down drug costs. The recent change in administration and control of the U.S. Senate may result in initiatives to further such competition or downward pricing.
Following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product. Moreover, in addition to generic competition, Petros could face competition from other companies seeking approval of drug products that are similar to the Company’s drug products using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Such applicants may be able to rely on Petros’ products, other approved drug products or published literature to develop drug products that are similar to Petros’. The introduction of similar drug products could expose our products to increased competition.
Any ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicants would need to submit patent certification statements with their applications for patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. There are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the Orange Book. Petros may be unable to obtain patents covering its products that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. Patents not listed in the Orange Book would not receive the protections provided by the Hatch Waxman Act.
Moreover, if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files a paragraph IV challenge to any patents that Petros may list in the FDA’s Orange Book and the Company does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receiving notice of a paragraph IV certification, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant would not be subject to a 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights, however, would likely be complex in nature, may be expensive and time consuming, may divert management’s attention, and may result in unfavorable results.
Moreover, if any product candidate does not receive any anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity, that product candidate may face generic or 505(b)(2) product competition sooner than anticipated, which could materially and adversely impact Petros’ business. Finally, there are already generic versions of other ED drugs on the market against which the Petros drug product competes. As generic products, these products are priced below Petros, presenting the risk that patients and their physicians will opt for those products instead of the Petros brand product.
The business that Petros conducts outside the United States may be adversely affected by international risk and uncertainties.
Although Petros’ operations are based in the United States, it conducts certain business outside the U.S. and expects to continue to do so in the future. Currently, Petros possesses the rights to license, develop, market, sell and distribute Stendra® in Canada, South America, and India, and its VED products are also marketed internationally. The active pharmaceutical ingredient for Stendra® is produced in France and shipped to the United States in tablet form for packaging. One of the manufacturers of our medical devices is based in China, and Petros expects to expand contract manufacturing for certain of its products in Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa in the future. Any business that it conducts outside the United States will be subject to additional risks that may materially adversely affect its ability to conduct business in international markets, including:

● | the ability to receive any required regulatory authorizations to commercialize products internationally and the ability to comply with international regulatory requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain other countries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20




● | unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | economic weakness, including inflation or political instability, in particular foreign economies and markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | production shortages resulting from any events affecting a product candidate and/or finished drug product supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism or natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods and fires; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | failure to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.
Petros has concluded that there are material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, which, if not remediated, could materially adversely affect its ability to timely and accurately report its results of operations and financial condition. The accuracy of Petros’ financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure (including with respect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in Petros’ disclosures (including with respect to financial information), require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency, and expose it to legal or regulatory proceedings.
In connection with the audit of its December 31, 2021 financial statements, Petros’ management identified the following deficiencies, which it considers to be “material weaknesses,” which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably result in a material misstatement in the Company’s financial statements:

● | Petros currently has an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight controls and does not enforce the implementation of key controls reflected on its internal control process matrices. This restricts the Company’s ability to gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements in a timely manner, including timely and adequate review of schedules and analysis used in the financial close process and the documentation and review of the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles to significant non-routine transactions. The Company should evaluate their significant processes to ensure the key controls are being carried out as designed;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The size of Petros’ accounting and IT department makes it impracticable to achieve an appropriate segregation of duties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Petros does not have appropriate IT access related controls specifically:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Elevated privileges such as administrator access to financial systems are not always assigned to individuals who do not bear responsibility for performing financial reporting or posting financial transactions (for example IT personnel).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | There is no limit to the number of password attempts allowed before an account becomes locked out.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | There is no maximum length of days a password can be in use.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

The Company should implement mitigating controls that would prevent or detect (in a timely manner) unauthorized transactions that might result.

21



Petros’ remediation efforts are ongoing and it will continue its initiatives to implement and document policies, procedures, and internal controls. Remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening the internal control environment will require a substantial effort throughout 2022 and beyond, as necessary, and Petros will test the ongoing operating effectiveness of the new and existing controls in future periods. The material weaknesses cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Petros cannot guarantee that it will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses it identified or that its internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable it to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
Petros cannot guarantee that its management will be successful in identifying and retaining appropriate personnel; that newly engaged staff or outside consultants will be successful in identifying material weaknesses in the future; or that appropriate personnel will be identified and retained prior to these deficiencies resulting in material and adverse effects on Petros’ business.
Risks Related to Petros’ Personnel
Because Petros is a small pharmaceutical company with limited resources, it may be unable to attract qualified personnel.
Because of the specialized nature of its business, Petros’ ability to develop products and to compete with its current and future competitors largely depends upon its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial, marketing, consulting and scientific personnel. Petros faces intense competition for qualified employees and consultants from biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Attracting, retaining or replacing these personnel on acceptable terms may be difficult and time-consuming given the high demand in its industry for similar personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in this business sector, and we cannot assure you that Petros will be able to attract the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business.
Petros will need to expand its operations and increase its size, and it may experience difficulties in managing growth.
As Petros increases the number of products it owns or has the right to sell, it may need to increase personnel headcounts with respect to sales, marketing, product development, scientific, or administrative departments. In addition, to meet its obligations as a public company, it will need to increase its general and administrative capabilities. The management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. The need to effectively manage its operations, growth and various projects requires that it:

● | successfully attract and recruit new employees with the required expertise and experience;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successfully grow marketing, distribution and sales infrastructure; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to improve operational, manufacturing, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Petros is unable to manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, its business may be adversely affected.
​

22



Petros may be adversely affected by any misconduct or improper activities on the part of its individual employees, principal investigators or consultants.
Petros is exposed to the risk that any of its employees, principal investigators and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Although Petros has adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of its employees, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions it takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting it from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. These laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in Petros’ nonclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to Petros’ reputation.
Additionally, Petros is subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against Petros, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on its business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of Petros’ operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business and results of operations.
Cyberattacks and other data security breaches could compromise our proprietary and confidential information, which could harm our business and reputation or cause us to incur increased expenses to address any such breaches.
In the ordinary course of our business, Petros generates, collects and stores proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. If a cyber incident, such as a phishing or ransomware attack, virus, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failure, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware or other similar issue, impairs, shuts down, or penetrates our computer systems, our proprietary and confidential information, including e-mails and other electronic communications, may be misappropriated. In addition, an employee, contractor, or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. As a result, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to unpermitted access by hackers or other breaches, or employee error or malfeasance. Any such compromise of our data security and access to, or public disclosure or loss of, confidential business or proprietary information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, provide our competitors with valuable information and subject us to additional costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also incur significant remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer or employee information, repairing system damage or providing benefits to affected customers or employees.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings for Petros
Petros’ approved drug products are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, drug products could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and Petros may be subject to penalties if it fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences unanticipated product problems.
Drug products approved by the applicable regulatory authorities for commercialization are subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such product. These requirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and listing requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with cGMPs relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and GCPs for any clinical trials conducted following approval.
Product sponsors and their collaborators, including contract manufacturers, could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or that the product is less effective than previously thought or other problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and after approval, may yield various results, including:

● | restrictions on manufacturing or distribution, or marketing of such products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on the labeling, including restrictions on the indication or approved patient population, and required additional warnings, such as black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | modifications to promotional pieces;
--+-------------------------------------


● | issuance of corrective information;
--+------------------------------------


● | requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or other clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | requirements to establish or modify a REMS or a similar strategy;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes to the way the product is administered;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | reputational harm;
--+-------------------


● | the product becoming less competitive;
--+---------------------------------------


● | warning, untitled, or cyber letters;
--+-------------------------------------


● | suspension of marketing or withdrawal of the products from the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls of products;
--+---------------------

24




● | fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention;
--+------------------------------


● | FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these events could prevent Petros from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of its products or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing products. Any of these events could further have other material and adverse effects on Petros’ operations and business.
The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of product candidates, that could limit the marketability of products, or that could impose additional regulatory obligations on Petros.
Petros relies on third-party contract manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of its products.
Petros currently only has facilities to assemble its VED products, and therefore must rely on qualified third-party contract manufactures with appropriate facilities and equipment to contract manufacture commercial quantities of products. Petros also relies on contract manufacturers to produce quantities of its product candidates to support its development programs. Petros expects to pursue additional contract manufacturing for certain of its products in the future. Any performance failure on the part of its contract manufacturers could delay production or delivery of any approved products and could delay product candidate development programs, depriving Petros of potential product revenue and resulting in development programs taking longer than planned. Failure by Petros’ contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, delays in development programs, withdrawals of marketing approvals, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve new marketing applications or supplements, cost overruns or other problems that could materially adversely affect its business. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance.
These third-party contract manufacturers are also subject to cGMP and/or the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) regulations, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies perform ongoing periodic unannounced inspections to ensure strict compliance with cGMP/QSR and other applicable government regulations. Prior to approving a marketing application, manufacturers will also need to validate their manufacturing process. The FDA will also inspect the proposed manufacturing facilities to confirm that they can produce products meeting the FDA’s regulatory standards. Failure to comply with these requirements may subject Petros to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarment, voluntary recall of a product or failure to secure product approvals, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Petros’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Beyond contractual remedies that may be available to it, Petros does not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards.

25



If, for any reason, Petros’ contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, it may be required to replace them. Although Petros believes there are a number of potential replacements, it may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements. Petros may compete with other companies for access to manufacturing facilities that can produce products in accordance with the FDA’s regulatory standards. If third party manufacturers should cease to continue to provide manufacturing services for any reason, Petros likely would experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of its products and product candidates to meet commercial demand or advance its development programs. Third-party facilities may also be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, health pandemics or outbreaks, or such facilities could face manufacturing issues, such as contamination or regulatory findings following a regulatory inspection of such facility. In such instances, Petros may need to locate an appropriate replacement third-party relationship, which may not be readily available or on acceptable terms, which would cause additional delay and increased expense. The addition of a new or alternative manufacturer may also require FDA approvals and may have a material adverse effect on our business.
The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet quality standards could cause Petros to miss the delivery date requirements of its customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect as Petros’ revenue would decrease and it would incur net losses as a result of sales of the product, if any sales could be made.
Regulatory approval is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which approval has been granted. Petros may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, or other enforcement actions if regulatory authorities determine that it is promoting any products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, resulting in reputational and business damage.
Petros must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion of FDA regulated products. Promotional communications with respect to therapeutics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and continuing review by the FDA, Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public. When the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities issue regulatory approval, the approval is limited to those specific uses and indications for which a product is approved. Companies may not market or promote products for those indications and uses, for which the product has not received approval. For devices exempt from Section 510(k) of the FDCA, such as Petros’ VED devices, the FDA requires that companies promote such products consistent with the relevant device classification. Claims outside the scope of the 510(k)-exempt classification would be considered “off-label” and trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) or other premarket submission to FDA. Companies must also be able to sufficiently substantiate any product claims and must abide by the FDA’s strict requirements regarding the content of promotions and advertising.
While physicians may choose to prescribe products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, companies are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications and uses that are not specifically approved by the FDA or, for 510(k)-exempt devices, are outside the scope of the relevant device classification. If Petros is found to have impermissibly promoted any product, it may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations regarding product promotion, particularly those prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted a product may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.

In the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of products for off-label uses can also subject a company to false claims and other litigation under federal and state statutes, including fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws. Such litigation can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict a company’s business through, for example, corporate integrity agreements, suspension or exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing others to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. These False Claims Act lawsuits have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, up to $3.0 billion, pertaining to certain sales practices and promoting off-label uses. In addition, False Claims Act lawsuits may expose sponsors to follow-on claims by private payers based on fraudulent marketing practices. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that companies will have to defend a false claim action, and pay settlements fines or restitution, as well as criminal and civil penalties, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal and state healthcare programs.
In the United States, the distribution of drug product samples to physicians must further comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, and the promotion of pharmaceutical products are subject to additional FDA requirements and restrictions on promotional statements. If the FDA determines that promotional activities violate its regulations and policies pertaining to product promotion, it could request the modification of promotional materials or could subject a company to regulatory or other enforcement actions, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, requests for recalls, payment of civil fines, disgorgement of money, imposition of operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, and other enforcement actions.
To the extent that any of our product candidates may be eligible, Petros may seek orphan drug designation from the FDA. However, there is no guarantee that Petros will be able to maintain this designation, receive this designation, or receive or maintain any corresponding benefits, including periods of exclusivity.
To the extent eligible, Petros may seek orphan drug designation for its product candidates. While orphan drug designation would provide Petros with certain advantages, it neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.
Generally, if a product candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives marketing approval before another product considered by the FDA to be the same, for the same orphan indication, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years.
Petros may not be able to obtain any future orphan drug designations. Orphan drug designations do not guarantee that Petros will be able to successfully develop its product candidates or maintain any orphan drug designations. For instance, orphan drug designations may be revoked if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request.
Moreover, even if Petros is able to receive and maintain orphan drug designations, it may ultimately not receive any period of regulatory exclusivity if the product candidate is approved. For instance, Petros may not receive orphan product regulatory exclusivity if the indication for which it receives FDA approval is broader than the orphan drug designation. Orphan exclusivity may also be lost for the same reasons that orphan drug designation may be lost. Orphan exclusivity may further be lost if Petros is unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

27



Even if Petros obtains orphan exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition, as different products can be approved for the same condition or products that are the same can be approved for different conditions. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can also subsequently approve a product containing the same principal molecular features for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior. The FDA may further grant orphan drug designation to multiple sponsors for the same compound or active molecule and for the same indication. If another sponsor receives FDA approval for such product before Petros does, Petros would be prevented from launching its product in the United States for the orphan indication for a period of at least seven years unless it can demonstrate clinical superiority. Moreover, third-party payors may reimburse for products off-label even if not indicated for the orphan condition.
Petros’ medical devices are subject to stringent regulatory oversight and any adverse regulatory action may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
Medical device products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices.
Although external penile rigidity devices have been eligible for an exemption from 510(k) clearance requirements since 2004 if they comply with applicable special controls, Petros’ VEDs were originally approved under a 510(k) clearance prior to such exemption. There may, thus, be confusion and/or inconsistencies between FDA and Petros and/or among regulatory inspectors and other officials regarding the extent to which Petros’ VEDs must comply with the special controls established for 510(k)-exempt VEDs. Petros’ VEDs are currently marketed in accordance with their respective 510(k) summaries, as Petros does not believe they have undergone any modification or been marketed beyond their 510(k)-cleared indications, such that they would need to comply with the applicable special controls, rather than their original 510(k) clearances, to lawfully remain on the market. However, FDA may disagree with this position, and Petros could be subject to enforcement action and/or subject to additional regulatory requirements, which may have an adverse effect on its business. To the extent Petros’ VEDs are (currently or in the future) not manufactured or marketed in accordance with their original 510(k) summaries and, thus, must adhere to the FDA’s special controls for external penile rigidity devices to lawfully remain on the market, there may be substantial costs, time, and resources devoted to bringing the VEDs into, and maintaining, compliance with such special controls, given the number and nature of the applicable requirements. For example, to be 510(k)-exempt, VEDs (that are not marketed under a valid 510(k) clearance) must have certain design features, such as a manual safety mechanism and meet precise requirements with regard to vacuum level, shape and surface design, and electrical safety. The special controls also contain detailed labeling requirements, including numerous specified warnings and precautions.
Both before and after a medical device product is commercially released, Petros has ongoing responsibilities under FDA and foreign regulations. For example, Petros is required to comply with QSR, which sets forth the good manufacturing requirements for medical devices. These include requirements related to design controls, production and process controls, process validation, purchasing controls, supplier oversight, complaint handling and investigation, corrective and preventative actions, and record-keeping. In addition, the FDA’s medical device reporting regulation requires companies to provide information to the FDA whenever they become aware of evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence.
Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action. If the FDA or equivalent foreign agency were to conclude that Petros is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of its medical devices may be hazardous or defective, the FDA or equivalent foreign agency could take enforcement action, which may include issuance of a warning letter, untitled letter, or other enforcement letter; seizure of the device; requesting or requiring a recall or other field action; or requiring the repair, replacement, or refund the cost of the medical device. The FDA may also impose manufacturing and other operating restrictions; enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices; or assess civil or criminal penalties against Petros or its officers or employees. In addition, the FDA could recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict Petros from effectively manufacturing, marketing, and selling products and could have a material, adverse effect on Petros’ financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material, adverse effect on Petros’ financial condition and results of operations.

28



The FDA also regulates the promotion and marketing of medical devices and requires that manufacturers only make promotional claims or statements that are consistent with the indications and labeling cleared, authorized, or approved by the FDA. For 510(k)-exempt devices, such as the Petros’ VED devices, the FDA requires that Petros promote such products consistent with the relevant device classification. Claims outside the scope of the 510(k)-exempt classification would be considered “off-label” and trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) or other premarket submission to the FDA. The FDA may take enforcement action against Petros (as described above), should the FDA determine it has engaged in “off-label” promotion or other violative marketing activities.
Petros currently plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for H100™ for treatment of Peyronie’s disease, which will allow Petros to rely, in part, on published scientific literature and/or the FDA’s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved drug products. If Petros is not able to pursue this strategy, it will need to conduct additional development activities beyond what is currently planned, development costs will increase, and Petros may be delayed in receiving regulatory authority approval. The submission of 505(b)(2) NDAs may also subject Petros to the risk of patent infringement lawsuits or regulatory actions that would delay or prevent submission of a marketing application to the FDA, or the FDA’s marketing application review and approval.
The Hatch-Waxman Act added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA, permitting the filing of a NDA, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature and/or the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product and to support the reliance on the applicable published literature or referenced product, referred to as bridging. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, if such approval is supported by study data. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product’s label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions.
Petros currently plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for H100™ for treatment of Peyronie’s disease. If the FDA disagrees with the appropriateness of reliance on a reference listed drug or published literature or if Petros is not otherwise able to bridge to the reference listed drug or published literature, the Company may need to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies, which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays or to the termination of the development program. If Petros is unable to obtain approval through the 505(b)(2) NDA process, it may be required to pursue the more expensive and time consuming 505(b)(1) approval process, which consists of full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness conducted by or for the applicant.
There may also be circumstances under which the FDA would not allow Petros to pursue a 505(b)(2) application. For instance, should the FDA approve a pharmaceutically equivalent product to H100™, it is the FDA’s policy that the appropriate submission would be an ANDA for a generic version of the approved product. Petros may, however, not be able to immediately submit an ANDA or have an ANDA approval made effective, as the application could be blocked by others’ periods of patent and regulatory exclusivity protection.
Notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2), pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its policies and practices with respect to Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approvals. It is also not uncommon for a sponsor of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. Any inability to pursue a 505(b)(2) application could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than Petros’, which could hurt the Company’s competitive position and business prospects.

29



The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway may also subject Petros to the risk of patent infringement lawsuits or other regulatory actions that could prevent submission of a marketing application or prevent the FDA from making the approval of a marketing application effective. Applicants submitting NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA must provide a patent certification for the patents listed in FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book, for all reference listed drugs and for all brand name products identified in published literature upon which the 505(b)(2) application relies. The possible certifications are that (1) no patent information has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. If there are any applicable listed patents, the FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application until all listed patents have expired, unless the applicant challenges the listed patents through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification, or otherwise indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use.
If Petros does challenge a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of the patents or NDAs that the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one time, automatic, 30-month stay of the FDA’s ability to make the 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective. In such a case, the FDA may not make the 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. Accordingly, Petros may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such product candidates may be commercialized, if at all. In addition, a 505(b)(2) application approval may, in some cases, not be submitted, or may, in other cases, not be made effective until any existing non-patent regulatory exclusivities have expired or, if possible, are carved out from the label.
If Petros is unable to advance its product candidates, including H100™, in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize its product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, its business may be materially harmed.
Petros is not permitted to market or promote any of its product candidates before it receives regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and it may never receive such regulatory approval. Petros may only receive approval in a limited patient population, it may experience delays in receiving such regulatory approval, or it may not receive regulatory approval for new indications or for H100™. Even if Petros successfully commercializes H100™, it may not be successful in developing and commercializing any other product candidates, and its commercial opportunities may be limited.
Petros cannot be certain that any of its product candidates will be successful in clinical and preclinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, its product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials and Petros submits the required marketing applications seeking regulatory authorization for their use.
For each product candidate, Petros must demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, obtain manufacturing supply capacity and expertise, and substantially invest in marketing efforts before it is able to generate any revenue from such product candidate. The success of Petros’ product candidates, and H100™ in particular, will depend on several factors, including the following:

● | approval of H100™ or other products by the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials, the design and implementation of which are agreed to by the applicable regulatory authorities, and the conduct of clinical trials by contract research organizations (“CROs”) to successfully conduct such trials within Petros’ planned budget and timing parameters and without materially adversely impacting its trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful data from its clinical and preclinical programs that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of its product candidates in the intended populations to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | timely receipt, if at all, of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers, as applicable, for continued clinical supply and commercial manufacturing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30




● | successful development of Petros’ manufacturing processes and transfer to new third-party facilities to support future development activities and commercialization that are operated by contract manufacturing organizations in a manner compliant with all regulatory requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for Petros’ product candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful commercial launch of Petros’ other product candidates, if and when approved;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | acceptance of Petros’ products, if and when approved, by patients, the relevant medical communities and third-party payers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | effective competition with other therapies;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | establishment and maintenance of adequate healthcare coverage and reimbursement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Petros’ ability to avoid infringing upon the patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continued compliance with any post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory authorities, including any required post-marketing clinical trials or the elements of any post-marketing REMs that may be required by the FDA or comparable requirements in other jurisdictions to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Petros is unsuccessful with respect to these factors, it could experience significant delays or barriers to the successful commercialization of its product candidates, which may materially harm Petros’ business. Even if Petros successfully obtains regulatory approvals to manufacture and market its product candidates, its revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which it gains regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that Petros is targeting are not as significant as it estimates, it may not generate significant revenues from sales of its approved products.
Petros plans to seek regulatory approval to commercialize its product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in many countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approval in multiple countries Petros must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of each such country or jurisdiction regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution. Petros cannot predict success in any such jurisdictions, and the time required to obtain approval in foreign countries may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval.
Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. Petros may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Petros’ product candidates.
The risk of failure in drug and product development is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of H100™ or other unapproved product candidates, Petros must complete nonclinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Petros’ product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete, and their outcomes are inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. It is impossible to predict when or if Petros’ unapproved product candidates will prove to be effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval.

31



Petros may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated because costs are greater than we anticipate or for a variety of other reasons, such as:

● | delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that Petros is able to execute;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial, including approval from the appropriate IRB, to conduct testing of a candidate on human subjects, or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inability, delay or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinical sites and investigators deviating from the clinical protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, including unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials and increased expenses associated with the services of Petros’ CROs and other third parties;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinical trials of Petros’ product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and it may decide, or regulators may require Petros, to conduct additional nonclinical studies, clinical trials or abandon product development programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Petros’ third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to Petros in a timely manner, or at all;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the supply or quality of Petros’ product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of its product candidates may be insufficient;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require Petros to submit additional data or impose other requirements before permitting it to initiate a clinical trial; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval for Petros’ product candidates. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with Petros’ clinical trial design and its interpretation of data from clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for Petros’ clinical trials.
Petros cannot be certain as to what type and how many clinical trials the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will require Petros to conduct before it may successfully gain approval to market H100™. Prior to approving a new product, the FDA generally requires that the efficacy of the product be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.
Petros’ product development costs will also increase if it experiences delays in nonclinical and clinical development or receiving the requisite marketing approvals. Petros does not know whether any of its nonclinical studies or clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all, which may harm our business and results of operations.

32



If Petros experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, development of its product candidates may be delayed or prevented, which would have a material adverse effect on its business.
Petros may not be able to initiate clinical trials for H100™ or its other product candidates if it is unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials.
Patient enrollment may be affected if Petros’ competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that are under development for the same indications as Petros’ product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for its clinical trials instead enroll in clinical trials of its competitors’ product candidates. Patient enrollment may also be affected by other factors, including:

● | size and nature of the patient population;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | severity of the condition under investigation;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | patient eligibility criteria for the trial in question;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | nature of the trial protocol;
--+------------------------------


● | Petros’ ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the occurrence of adverse events attributable to Petros’ product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | the number and nature of competing products or product candidates and ongoing clinical trials of competing product candidates for the same indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patient referral practices of physicians;
--+------------------------------------------


● | the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continued enrollment of prospective patients by clinical trial sites.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

If Petros experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, its clinical trials may be delayed or terminated. Any delays in completing Petros’ clinical trials will increase its costs, delay or prevent its product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize Petros’ ability to commence product sales and generate additional revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.

33



Petros relies on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements.
Petros may use third parties, CROs, study sites, and others to conduct, supervise, and monitor preclinical and clinical trials for product candidates. While Petros has agreements governing the activities of such third parties, it has limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. Third-party service providers are not Petros’ employees, and except for remedies available under agreements with such third parties, Petros cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to its development programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study plans, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised, studies may need to be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated, Petros may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for product candidates, Petros may not be able to or may be delayed in commercializing product candidates, or Petros or the third party service providers may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. As a result, results of operations and the commercial prospects for product candidates would be harmed, costs could increase and Petros’ ability to generate revenues could be delayed. Third-party service providers may also have relationships with other entities, including Petros competitors, for whom they may also be conducting development activities that could harm Petros’ competitive position.
Reliance on third parties for development activities will reduce Petros’ control over these activities. Nevertheless, Petros is responsible for ensuring that its studies are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards. Regulatory authorities enforce their requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical and preclinical investigators, and trial sites. Any failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, may subject Petros or its third-party service providers to enforcement or other legal actions, the data generated in trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require the performance of additional studies.
Agreements with third parties conducting or otherwise assisting with studies might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If any of these relationships terminate, Petros may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative providers or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third parties involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, alternative arrangements could delay product development activities and adversely affect Petros’ business.
Petros’ relationships with prescribers, purchasers, third-party payers and patients are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, any violation of which could expose it to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.
Petros is subject to healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and oversight by federal and state governments, as well as foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its business. Physicians, other healthcare providers and third-party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation, prescription and use of any product candidates for which Petros has, or in the future obtains, marketing approval. Petros’ arrangements with such third parties are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain its business or financial arrangements and relationships through which it markets, sell and distributes any products for which it may obtain marketing approval, including potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs and debarment from federal government contracts. Restrictions under applicable domestic and foreign healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34




● | U.S. federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws, including the U.S. False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, including false statements regarding compliance with regulations material to payment by government programs for drugs and medical supplies, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; actions may be brought by the government or a whistleblower and may include an assertion that a claim for payment by federal healthcare programs for items and services which results from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) that imposes liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Efforts to ensure that Petros’ business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If governmental authorities conclude that Petros’ business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, then government enforcement actions are possible.

Petros’ marketing and advertising are regulated by the FDA, Federal Trade Commission and State and County Attorneys General, and it may face enforcement and litigation specifically related to the nature and sales channels of its products.
Petros and its employees, as well as its contractors, must comply with applicable regulatory requirements and restrictions relating to marketing and advertising. If we are unable to maintain compliant and adequate sales and marketing capabilities, including training Petros’ new sales personnel (including sales contractors) regarding applicable regulatory requirements and restrictions, we may not be able to increase Petros’ product revenue, may generate increased expenses, and may be subject to regulatory investigations and enforcement actions.
Petros’ commercial efforts, including its sales and marketing efforts, must comply with various laws and regulations. Under applicable FDA marketing regulations, prescription drug promotions must be consistent with and not contrary to labeling, present “fair balance” between risks and benefits, be truthful and not false or misleading, be adequately substantiated (when required), and include adequate directions for use. Additionally, Petros’ marketing activities may be subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and consumer class-action liability if it engages in any practices that appear misleading or deceptive to the applicable agencies or consumers.
In addition to the requirements applicable to approved drug products, Petros may also be subject to enforcement action in connection with any promotion of an investigational new drug. A sponsor or investigator, or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, may not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the therapeutic candidate.
If the FDA investigates Petros’ marketing and promotional materials or other communications and finds that any of its current or future commercial products are being marketed or promoted in violation of the applicable regulatory restrictions, Petros could be subject to FDA enforcement action. Any enforcement action (or related lawsuit, which could follow such action) brought against Petros in connection with alleged violations of applicable drug promotion requirements, or prohibitions, could have an adverse effect on its reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as the reputation of any approved drug products it may commercialize or promote in the future. In addition, in some areas, Petros may also be reliant on third parties’ compliance with such regulations.
Moreover, laws and regulations covering commercialization activities in the pharmaceutical industry are constantly changing, and Petros will need to continually update and adjust its policies and sales and marketing and commercialization activities to meet legal and regulatory requirements. Its ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements at any time in time does not guarantee it will continue to be able to comply in the future.
Petros may be subject to potential product liability and other claims, creating risks and expense.
Petros is also exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products. Product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is extremely expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Petros cannot guarantee that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate. A successful claim against Petros in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon it and on its financial condition.
In addition to direct expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is a possibility of adverse publicity and loss of revenues as a result of product liability claims. Product liability claims can also result in regulatory consequences, such as the withdrawal of clinical trial participants, termination of clinical trials or programs, governmental authority investigations and enforcement actions, product recalls and withdrawals of approval, as well as labeling revisions. Product liability is a significant commercial risk for Petros. Plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. In addition, in the age of social media, plaintiffs’ counsel now has a wide variety of tools to advertise their services and solicit new clients for litigation. Thus, any significant product liability litigation or mass tort in which Petros is a defendant may have a larger number of plaintiffs than such actions have seen historically because of the increasing use of widespread and media-varied advertising.

Government regulations that mandate price controls and limitations on patient access to its products or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for such products may impact Petros’ business, and future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies.
Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering implementing, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. If implemented, efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payments for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect Petros’ business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in laws could negatively impact Petros’ business.
Petros’ future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations, including, among others, changes in taxation requirements, competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the United States and other countries.
Risks Related to Petros’ Intellectual Property
Petros’ license agreement for Stendra® is a sublicense that is dependent on Vivus’ license agreement with a third party.
Revenues from Stendra® represent a significant percentage of Petros’ overall revenues. Petros’ rights to market, distribute and sell avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) are granted under the License Agreement, which is a sublicense under the MTPC License. The MTPC License contains certain termination rights that would allow MTPC to terminate the agreement if Vivus were to breach any of the terms of the MTPC License or become insolvent or bankrupt.
In the event that MTPC terminates the MTPC License with Vivus because of any contractual breach, Petros has step-in rights with MTPC, which would allow Petros to continue to sell Stendra®.
Vivus has granted a license to Hetero USA, Inc. and Hetero Labs Limited to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of Stendra® in the United States once it comes off patent.
On January 3, 2017, Vivus granted Hetero USA, Inc. and Hetero Labs Limited (collectively, “Hetero”) a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of Stendra® described in its abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) filing in the United States as of the date that is the later of (a) October 29, 2024, which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit, or (b) the date that Hetero obtains final approval from FDA of the Hetero ANDA. Future competition from generic versions could negatively impact the sales volume of Stendra®, and prices for pharmaceutical products typically decline following generic entry onto the market. The date on which generic competition with Stendra® begins may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires, and instead may occur upon the loss or expiration of patent protection or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of Stendra®. If that should occur, Petros could lose a significant portion of revenues for Stendra® which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.

If Petros fails to protect its intellectual property rights, its ability to pursue the development of its products would be negatively affected.
Petros’ long-term success largely depends on its ability to market technologically competitive products. Petros relies and expects to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights. If Petros or its licensors fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of its branded products using its proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to those of Petros. In addition, the patents Petros has licensed may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect it against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide Petros with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. Petros may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding its or its licensors’ intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term.
Petros’ ability to enforce its in-licensed patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights, and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in policies or practices that may weaken its intellectual property framework (e.g., a policy of routine compulsory licensing (or threat of compulsory licensing) of pharmaceutical intellectual property). Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. As such, Petros may have difficulty protecting its proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
In addition to patents, Petros relies on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and security measures to protect its confidential and proprietary information. These measures do not guarantee protection of its trade secrets or other proprietary information. There is risk that third parties could use Petros’ technology and it could lose any competitive advantage it may have. In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to Petros’ trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage it may have.
Furthermore, in some cases, Petros may rely on its licensors to conduct patent prosecution, patent maintenance, or enforce patents on its behalf. Therefore, Petros’ ability to ensure that these patents are properly prosecuted, maintained, or defended may be limited, which may adversely affect Petros’ rights to the licensed technology. Failure by a licensor to properly conduct patent prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement could materially harm Petros’ ability to obtain suitable patent protection to cover its commercial products, thereby potentially reducing Petros’ royalties from any sublicensee and/or limiting the patent barrier to competition.
Petros may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Petros may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of its competitors, additional interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trade Office (“USPTO”) to determine the priority of inventions, or post-grant review, inter parties review, or re-examination proceedings filed with the USPTO. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce Petros’ licensed patents, to protect its trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. An adverse determination in litigation or USPTO post-issuance interference proceedings to which Petros may become a party could subject it to significant liabilities, require it to obtain licenses from third parties, restrict or prevent it from selling its products in certain markets, dissuade companies from collaborating with it, or permit third parties to directly compete with it. Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
Competitors may infringe Petros’ licensed patents and Petros may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of Petros’ size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent Petros has licensed is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that Petros’ licensed patents do not cover the other party’s technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of Petros’ licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.

38



Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or USPTO post-issuance proceedings, there is a risk that some of Petros’ confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
If Petros infringes the rights of third parties, it could be prevented from selling products and forced to pay damages and defend against litigation.
If Petros’ products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, it could incur substantial costs and may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether Petros wins or loses, and which could result in a substantial diversion of its financial and management resources.
Petros may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.
Petros may employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. It may be subject to claims that it or its employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees’ former employers or other third parties. Petros may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in its patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if Petros does not prevail, it could be required to pay substantial damages and could lose rights to important intellectual property. Even if Petros is successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to its management and other employees.
Changes in trends in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, including changes to market conditions, could adversely affect Petros’ operating results.
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and drug discovery and development companies more specifically, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Petros’ competitors might develop technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than Petros’ current or future technologies, or that render its technologies or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies or products and Petros cannot make enhancements to its technologies or products to remain competitive, its competitive position and, in turn, its business, revenue and financial condition, may be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Related to Petros’ Strategic Transactions
Acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.
Petros has made, and in the future may continue to make, strategic acquisitions including licenses of third-party products. However, it may not be able to identify suitable acquisition and licensing opportunities. It may pay for acquisitions and licenses with equity or with convertible securities. In addition, acquisitions or licenses may expose Petros to operational challenges and risks, including:

● | the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business’ operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | diversion of management’s attention; and
--+-----------------------------------------

39




● | the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, acquired companies may have liabilities or risks that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. Petros cannot guarantee that the indemnification granted to it by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that are assumed upon consummation of an acquisition. Petros may learn additional information about acquired businesses that materially adversely affect it, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on its business.
Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect Petros’ results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Borrowings or issuance of convertible securities associated with any acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness, which could impact its ability to service its debt within the scheduled repayment terms.
Risks Related to Petros’ Common Stock
We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings, if any, in the development and growth of our business. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing and any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, will be our shareholders’ sole source of potential gain in the foreseeable future and our shareholders should not rely on an investment in our common stock for dividend income.
We are an “emerging growth company” and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We could remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2025; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our common stock.
Almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock, as well as a substantial number of shares of our common stock underlying outstanding options and warrants, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or an effective registration statement. We are generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on January 29, 2021, we may sell up to $100,000,000 of our equity securities over the next several years, and approximately $82,540,022 of our equity securities is available for sale under such registration statement. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock.
Our stock price may be volatile.
The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:

● | results of our operations and product development efforts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to obtain working capital financing;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | additions or departures of key personnel;
--+------------------------------------------


● | limited “public float” in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to execute our business plan;
--+------------------------------------------


● | sales of our common stock and decline in demand for our common stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory developments;
--+-------------------------


● | economic and other external factors;
--+-------------------------------------


● | investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty in the recent past. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at a desired price.
JCP III SM AIV, L.P. maintains the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to Petros’ stockholders for approval.
As of March 31, 2022, JCP III SM AIV, L.P. and its affiliates, in the aggregate, own approximately 27.57% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they could be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to Petros’ stockholders for approval, as well as Petros’ management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could significantly influence the election of directors or the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of Petros’ assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of Petros on terms that other stockholders may desire.

Our bylaws include a forum selection clause, which may impact your ability to bring actions against us.
Subject to certain limitations, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the federal securities laws of the United States against us, our officers, directors, employees or underwriters. These limitations on the forum in which stockholders may initiate action against us could create costs, inconvenience or otherwise adversely affect your ability to seek legal redress.
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, a court may decline to enforce these exclusive forum provisions with respect to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders may not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.
