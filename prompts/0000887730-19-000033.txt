ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Background of Company
KEMET Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “KEMET” and the “Company”), is a global manufacturer of passive electronic components. We first began manufacturing tantalum capacitors in 1958 as a division of Union Carbide Corporation (“UCC”) and became a stand-alone legal entity in 1990 following a management buyout from UCC. In 1992, we publicly issued shares of our common stock. Since then, we have made the following acquisitions:
Segment | Fiscal Year | Business 
Solid Capacitors Segment (“Solid Capacitors”) | 2007 | Tantalum Business Unit of EPCOS AG 
Film and Electrolytic Segment (“Film and Electrolytic”) | 2008 | Evox Rifa Group Oyj 
Film and Electrolytic | 2008 | Arcotronics Italia S.p.A. 
Film and Electrolytic | 2012 | Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC (renamed KEMET Foil Manufacturing, LLC (“KFM”))
Solid Capacitors | 2012 | Niotan Incorporated (renamed KEMET Blue Powder Corporation (“KBP”)) 
Corporate | 2013 | 34% economic interest in TOKIN Corporation (“TOKIN”) (1) 
Corporate | 2016 | IntelliData, Inc. (“IntelliData”) 
Solid Capacitors and Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators Segment (“MSA”) | 2018 | TOKIN (1) 

______________________________________________________________________________
(1) In fiscal year 2013, our subsidiary, KEMET Electronics Corporation (“KEC”) acquired a 34% economic interest in TOKIN as calculated based on the number of common shares held by KEC, directly and indirectly, in proportion to the aggregate number of common and preferred shares of TOKIN outstanding as of such date. The Company accounted for its investment in TOKIN using the equity method for a non-consolidated variable interest entity since KEC did not have the power to direct significant activities of TOKIN. During fiscal year 2018, KEMET entered into a Definitive NEC TOKIN Stock Purchase Agreement (the “TOKIN Purchase Agreement”) with NEC Corporation (“NEC”), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock of TOKIN not already held by KEMET. The transaction closed on April 19, 2017 and on that date, TOKIN became a 100% indirect owned subsidiary of KEMET. 
Through the above acquisitions and organic growth we have expanded our product base to include multilayer ceramic, solid and electrolytic aluminum and film capacitors, and electro-magnetics, sensors, and actuators.
Strategy
KEMET is committed to providing its customers with high quality, low cost solutions for their electronic applications and strives to create shareholder value primarily through the following strategic priorities:

• | leveraging our manufacturing expertise;


• | strengthening our “Go-to-Market” leadership position;


• | consistently attracting and retaining exceptional talent; and,


• | selectively target complementary acquisitions and equity investments.

KEMET measures its progress against these strategic priorities over the long-term based primarily on financial metrics including revenue growth, profitability, free cash flow, and balance sheet liquidity.
We believe this strategy has successfully transformed the Company and positioned it to capture the growing demand for custom designed, higher margin electronic components in several industry segments. KEMET's transformation has resulted in increased and sustainable margins, and has enhanced the durability of our revenue base. In addition, we intend to leverage KEMET's strong proprietary technology to support future organic growth in key markets.

Strategic Highlights
With the completion of the TOKIN acquisition and the vertical integration of KEMET's Solid Capacitors' Tantalum product line, the Tantalum product line is well positioned to continue its recent success. The Tantalum product line is now focused on its Polymer technology and is benefiting from operational synergies from the TOKIN acquisition, which reduced operating costs, improved yields, and provided access to new market segments. In addition, vertical integration of the tantalum ore supply chain has resulted in savings of approximately $50.0 million per year compared to 2012 and has created stability in our cost structure. As a result of the enhanced Polymer focus, KEMET’s Polymer Tantalum sales now lead the industry with greater than 50.0% market share. We believe leveraging KEMET's and TOKIN's manufacturing expertise combined with vertical integration has successfully transformed KEMET's Tantalum product line and positioned it well for new growth opportunities across multiple industry segments, especially those segments demanding higher reliability in harsh environment applications.  
KEMET's Solid Capacitors' Ceramic product line is also well positioned for new opportunities. The Ceramic product line began its transformation in 2008 when it shifted it's focus from consumer markets to business to business markets, across the automotive defense/aerospace, medical, energy, telecommunications, and industrial sectors. While KEMET's competitors focused on small case size multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCC's), KEMET's Ceramic product line focused on building a core competency in high-reliability, high-voltage/power, large case size MLCC's. Since 2010, the Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of KEMET's chosen markets was approximately 17.0%. KEMET's Ceramic MLCC's are in high demand, and during fiscal year 2019, the Company entered into long-term (10 year) supply agreements with three significant customers that are projected to account for approximately 33.0% of KEMET's total capacity in fiscal year 2022. KEMET is in the process of expanding its current MLCC production capacity, which currently is approximately 49 billion pieces per year. The Company expects to have the ability to produce 72 billion pieces per year by fiscal year 2022. Approximately 24 billion, or 33.0% of these pieces are committed to the three customers that signed long-term supply agreements. We believe operational and strategic agility have successfully transformed our Ceramic product line. 
The completion of KEMET's acquisition of TOKIN in fiscal year 2018 further diversified KEMET's products and geographic markets, facilitating cross selling opportunities that support KEMET's "long tail" (see below) selling strategy. TOKIN's MSA reportable segment added approximately $240.0 million in net sales. The added liquidity from TOKIN's balance sheet reduced KEMET's consolidated net debt, permitting a debt refinancing arrangement in Japan. This debt refinancing provides annual interest savings of approximately $21.0 million. Additionally, the acquisition has contributed to the development of new technology, and as noted above, has created operational synergies and improved yields in KEMET's existing Tantalum product line.
KEMET's “Go-to-Market” strategy includes four key elements which have contributed to KEMET's success and supported the structural transformation noted above:

• | Global Sales Team


• | Design-In Focus


• | Service "Long Tail" (high mix, low volume) Customers


• | Customer Digital Engagement Platform

KEMET's global sales team consists of over 100 professionals supporting each region. Sales people, application engineers and customer service representatives are located close to KEMET's customers allowing frequent face-to-face conversations. In addition, we partner with all the premier distributors in the electronics industry ensuring we obtain a large geographical sales presence and can leverage their expertise in stocking and servicing customers. 
Adding value to our customers is an important part of our relationship and over the years we have transformed our product portfolio from a commodity based approach to a customized, design-in approach. To support our design-in strategy, our global sales team includes field application engineers with degrees in electrical engineering that work directly with our customers at the early stages of product development to ensure KEMET's products are designed-into the product applications. As a result, today, we target all the key fast growing applications in the electronic market including, but not limited to, electric vehicles, industry 4.0, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and data storage.
While a global sales team focuses on our larger customers, KEMET has also developed a comprehensive strategy to serve our “long tail” customers (the smaller customers), which are approximately 180,000 customers that account for approximately 50.0% of our net sales. This allows us to not only provide world class customer service to our smaller customers, but also provides KEMET with an improved opportunity to partner with today's smaller companies that are potentially tomorrow's leading electronic companies. To do so, we have developed an internal culture and supporting business processes to engage with high-mix/low-volume requirements that are typical from the “long-tail” customer.
5

KEMET supports its global sales initiatives with its market leading customer digital engagement platform. We believe the electronic component industry is still in the early stages of “digital disruption” (how electronic manufacturers go to market). We believe our existing and continuously improving component simulation, component search, and component quoting platforms for buyers are market leading and put KEMET at the forefront of the “digital disruption” that will transform how the electronic components are sold in the future.
Finally, as strategic opportunities are identified, we will evaluate and possibly pursue them if they would enable us to enhance our competitive position and expand our market presence. Our strategy is to acquire complementary capacitor and other related businesses allowing us to leverage our business model, potentially including those involved in other passive components that are synergistic with our customers’ technologies and our current product offerings. 
We believe KEMET's business strategy will allow us to leverage the global mega-trends of an increasingly electrified and connected world and positions KEMET well for growth, both internally and through acquisitions. Organic revenue is targeted to grow at an average annual rate of at least five percent over the next five years and revenue through acquisitions is targeted to grow at an annual rate of five percent by the end of the fifth year. Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates. Please refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors - for additional information on risks and uncertainties.
General
While KEMET competes in the passive electronic component industry, our strategic focus is on growth markets, specialty products requiring high reliability, and, within Ceramic, larger case size capacitors.
 Our product line consists of multilayer ceramic, tantalum, film and aluminum (solid and electrolytic) capacitors, and Electro-Magnetic Compatible (“EMC”) devices, sensors, and actuators. Product offerings include surface mounts, which are attached directly to the circuit board; leaded capacitors, which are attached to the circuit board using lead wires; and chassis-mount and other pin-through-hole board-mount capacitors, which utilize attachment methods such as screw terminal and snap-in. Capacitors are electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. As an essential passive component used in nearly all circuit boards, capacitors are typically used for coupling, decoupling, filtering, oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems, servers, personal computers, tablets, cellular phones, automotive electronic systems, defense and aerospace systems, consumer electronics, power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems (basically anything that plugs in or has a battery). While our broad product offering allows us to meet the majority of those needs independent of application and end use, our strategic focus is on high growth and specialty markets as noted above.
Solid Capacitors' products are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits, and the same circuit may contain both ceramic and tantalum capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are a popular choice because of their ability for high capacitance in a small volume package. While ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values while solid aluminum capacitors can be more effective in special applications. 
KEMET's Tantalum business continues to transition toward a higher proportion of Polymer technology sales in which KEMET has market share leadership greater than 50.0%.  Growth drivers for this product line include advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, tablets and PC’s, 5G infrastructure and connectivity, data servers and solid state drives and power density energy systems. 
 KEMET's Ceramic business continues to focus on its specialty (value added) and large cap size business. Growth drivers for Ceramic include electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, 5G infrastructure and connectivity, data servers and solid state drives, wireless charging, satellites, radar, and guidance systems.
Film, paper and aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used to support integrated circuits, but also are used in the field of power electronics to provide energy for applications such as motor starts, power conditioning, electromagnetic interference filtering safety, and inverters. Film and Electrolytic's self healing products deliver high reliability solutions for extreme conditions. Growth drivers for Film and Electrolytic include alternative energy solutions, electric vehicle charging stations, and hybrid and electric vehicles. 
KEMET's MSA business offers a broad line of electrical noise management products that play a key role in maintaining signal integrity across a number of end markets including telecommunications, mobile computing, automotive and general industries. Additionally, MSA's sensor and actuator business manufactures products that sense and respond to human activity, physical vibration, and electric current, which are found in home appliances, consumer devices, and industrial 
6

electrical equipment. Growth drivers for MSA include electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, industry 4.0, 5G infrastructure and connectivity, and power density and energy efficiency systems.
We believe the long-term demand for the components we offer will grow on a regional and global basis due to a variety of factors including electric vehicles ("EV"), vehicles with advanced driver assisted electronics, 5G infrastructure, industry 4.0, alternative energy and energy storage. The 'electrification of everything' is driving growth. We expect growth not only in end-products, but due to the increasing complexity of electronic products and the additional capacitors required in those products, we expect strong growth of the products required to support the 'electrification of everything'. KEMET, we believe, is strategically aligned in its manufacturing operations and in how we go-to-market to serve these growing markets.
Our Industry 
We compete with others that manufacture and distribute electronic components both domestically and globally and our success in the market is influenced by many factors, including price, availability, engineering specifications, quality and breadth of offering, performance characteristics, customer service and geographic location of our manufacturing sites. As in all manufacturing industries, improving cost of production is key to staying competitive. KEMET, as well as many of our larger competitors, have relocated their manufacturing operations to low cost regions and locations in closer proximity to our respective customers. 
Because capacitors are a fundamental component of electronic circuits, demand for capacitors tends to reflect the general demand for electronic products, as well as integrated circuits, which we believe over time will continue to grow. We believe growth in the electronics market and the resulting growth in demand for capacitors will be driven primarily by a number of recent trends which include:

• | industry 4.0:


◦ | the development of new products, applications and electronic controls for engines and industrial machinery, including cyber physical systems, cloud computing, and cognitive computing; security smart phones and mobile personal computing devices;


• | the “internet-of-things”;


◦ | the increase in the electronic content of existing products, such as home appliances and medical equipment, smart phones and mobile personal computing devices;


• | the enhanced functionality, complexity and convergence of electronic devices that use state-of-the-art microprocessors;


• | alternative and renewable energy systems;


• | EV and advanced driver assisted electronics; and,


• | the development of 5G infrastructure and connectivity.

The acquisition of TOKIN increased our market opportunity through the EMC devices and sensor and actuator markets.
Markets and Customers
Our products are sold to a variety of OEMs in a broad range of industries including the computer, communications, automotive, military, consumer, industrial, medical, and aerospace industries. We also sell products to EMS providers, which serve OEMs in these industries. Electronics distributors are an important channel of distribution in the electronics industry and represent a large channel through which we sell our capacitors. One electronics distributor, TTI, Inc., accounted for over 10% of our net sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017. If our relationship with this customer were to terminate, we would need to determine alternative means of delivering our products to the end-customers served by them. In addition, an aggregate of over 10% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 were driven by sales to EMS providers for incorporation into Apple Inc. products. 
Diversification is critical to the success of our business as our products reach a multitude of industries with various opportunities for growth. As a full-service provider in the capacitor space, KEMET produces approximately 95.0% of the dielectrics available to serve our customer needs. The TOKIN acquisition has increased KEMET's offering with a larger product portfolio including magnetics, sensors and actuators, enhancing its ability to deliver specialty and design-in solutions to the automotive, military, aerospace, medical, energy, communications, and industrial markets. While we are seeing a merging of major segments as connectivity and “internet-of-things” grow, the following table presents an overview of the diverse

KEMET in the United States
Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
Component manufacturing previously located in the United States has been substantially relocated to our lower-cost manufacturing facilities in Mexico, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and countries in Europe. The vision for KEMET's foreign subsidiaries is for them to be primarily local operations, with local management and workers, to help achieve our objective of being a global company. These facilities are responsible for maintaining our tradition of excellence in quality, service, and delivery, while accelerating cost-reduction efforts and supporting efforts to grow our customer base. Production remaining in the United States focuses primarily on early-stage manufacturing of new products and other specialty products for which customers are predominantly located in North America. 
On February 21, 2012, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Blue Powder, a leading manufacturer of tantalum powders. Blue Powder had been a significant supplier of tantalum powder to KEMET for several years. KBP's principal operating location was in Carson City, Nevada. The Company is currently in the process of modifying its vertical integration strategy by relocating its tantalum powder facility equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its existing Matamoros, Mexico plant.
To accelerate the pace of innovations, KEMET maintains an Innovation Center for Solid Capacitors near Greenville, South Carolina. The primary objectives of the KEMET Innovation Center are to ensure the flow of new product platforms, material sets, and processes that are expected to keep us at the forefront of our customers’ product designs, while enabling these products to be transferred rapidly to the most appropriate KEMET manufacturing location in the world for low-cost, high-volume production. 
KEMET in Mexico
We believe our operations in Mexico are among the most cost efficient in the world, and we expect they will continue to be our primary production facilities supporting North American and European customers for Solid Capacitors. One of the strengths of KEMET Mexico is that it is a local operation, including local management and workers. These facilities are responsible for maintaining KEMET’s tradition of excellence in quality, service, and delivery, while driving down costs. The facilities in Victoria and Matamoros are primarily focused on tantalum capacitors, while the facilities in Monterrey are focused on ceramic capacitors.
KEMET in Asia Pacific
We have a well-established manufacturing, sales and logistics network in Asia to support our customers’ Asian operations. We currently manufacture tantalum and aluminum polymer, film, and electrolytic products in China and film products in Indonesia. As a result of the acquisition of TOKIN on April 19, 2017, we manufacture electromagnetic compatibility and sensor and actuator products in China, Japan and Vietnam and tantalum capacitors in Thailand. In addition, we operate one innovation center for Solid Capacitors and one innovation center for MSA in Japan.
KEMET in Europe
We currently have one or more manufacturing locations in each of the following countries: Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal, and Sweden. In addition, we operate product innovation centers in Italy, Portugal and Sweden. We continue to maintain and enhance our strong European sales and customer service infrastructure, allowing us to continue to meet the local preferences of European customers who remain an important focus for KEMET.
Global Sales and Logistics
KEMET serves the needs of our global customer base through four geographic regions: North America and South America (“Americas”), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia and the Pacific Rim (“APAC”) and Japan and Korea (“JPKO”). We have a global sales team with 33 sales offices located in 11 countries and a global distribution network. We also have independent sales representatives located in several countries worldwide including: Brazil, Israel, Canada, and the United States. Our strategic focus is to ensure we have people near our customers to facilitate regular face-to-face communication. This is critical to ensure that KEMET is included during the design-in phase.
Consequently, in our major markets, we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. With a global sales organization that is customer-focused, our direct sales personnel from around the world serve on KEMET Global Account Teams committed to serving any customer location in the world with a dedicated KEMET representative. The traditional sales team is supported by regional Field Application Engineers who are experts in electronic engineering and market all of KEMET’s products by assisting customers with the resolution of capacitor application issues. We believe our direct sales force creates a distinct advantage in the marketplace by enabling us to establish and maintain strong relationships 
9

with our customers to efficiently process simple repeat business as well as to consult with customers on new and technically complex custom applications. In addition, where appropriate, we use independent commissioned representatives. This approach requires a blend of accountability and responsibility for specific customer locations, guided by an overall account strategy for each customer. Our sales team works with the customers throughout the entire purchasing process, following opportunities as they progress through concept, design, validation and, finally, mass production. In Japan, we market and sell directly and through manufacturers agents. These manufacturers agents create unique custom solutions integrating our products which help pull our products though the channel. 
Electronics distributors are an important distribution channel in the electronics industry and accounted for 42.2%, 39.2%, and 46.8% of our net sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A portion of our net sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors. In addition, our distributor policy includes inventory price protection and “ship-from-stock and debit” (“SFSD”) programs common in the industry.
Sales by Geography
In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, net sales by region were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 | Fiscal Year 2019 | | | | Fiscal Year 2018
 | Net Sales | | % ofTotal | | | | Net Sales | | % ofTotal
APAC | $ | 533,340 | | | 38.6 | % | | APAC | | $ | 479,987 | | | 40.0 | %
EMEA | 315,535 | | | 22.8 | % | | EMEA | | 277,898 | | | 23.1 | %
Americas | 337,842 | | | 24.4 | % | | Americas | | 259,105 | | | 21.6 | %
JPKO | 196,101 | | | 14.2 | % | | JPKO | | 183,191 | | | 15.3 | %
Total | $ | 1,382,818 | | | | | Total | | $ | 1,200,181 | | | 

We believe our regional balance of revenues is a benefit to our business. The geographic diversity of our net sales diminishes the impact of regional sales decreases caused by various holiday seasons. The Americas remains the leading region in the world for product design in activity where engagement with OEM design engineers determines product placement independent of the region of the world where the final product is manufactured. Please see Note 7, “Reportable Segment and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventory and Backlog
Our customers often encounter uncertain or changing demand for their products. They historically order products from us based on their forecast and if demand does not meet their forecasts, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without penalty. Additionally, many of our customers have started to require shorter lead times and “just in time” delivery. Consequently, the twelve-month order backlog is not a meaningful trend indicator for us.
Although we manufacture and inventory standardized products, a portion of our products are produced to meet specific customer requirements. Cancellations by customers of orders already in production could have an impact on inventories. Historically, however, cancellations have not been significant.
Competition
The capacitor industry, and the electronic industry in general, is characterized by a competitive and growing market environment. Competitive factors influencing the market for our products include: product quality, customer service, technical innovation, pricing, and timely delivery. We believe we compete favorably based on each of these factors. Additionally, we believe our strategic focus positions KEMET well in specific markets within the capacitor industry, aligns with our core competencies, and allows us to focus on growth and higher profitability markets.
Our major global competitors in the passive electronic component industry include AVX Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. LTD., Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd., TDK-EPC Corporation, Yageo Corporation, Walsin Technology Corporation, LTD., Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay”), Xiamen Faratronic Co. LTD., Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Nippon Chemi-Con Corp., Nichicon Corp., and Rubycon Corporation. 
We believe the Company's strategic shift over the last few years to more customized, design-in and high reliability solutions has given it a unique competitive position in the market place and enhanced its durability of revenue base. In the highly commoditized multi layered ceramic capacitor market KEMET focuses primarily on the large case sizes capacitors and the growing automotive market segment offering niche products required in high temperature, vibration, and voltage environments.

Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are tantalum powder, tantalum ore, barium titanate, calcium zirconate, rare earth oxides, palladium, aluminum, silver, copper, nickel and tin. These materials are considered commodities and are subject to price volatility. Additionally, any delays in obtaining raw materials for our products could hinder our ability to manufacture our products, negatively impacting our competitive position and our relationships with our customers. KEMET is committed to partnerships and close relationships with key suppliers of the critical materials listed above. We also actively pursue sourcing from multiple manufacturing sites of current suppliers, as well as second sourcing of critical raw materials to mitigate the risk of supply discontinuity in case of unforeseen geo-political events or natural disasters.
Tantalum is mined principally in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda. As a result of our tantalum vertical integration program which began in fiscal year 2012, we have reduced our exposure to price volatility and supply uncertainty in the tantalum supply chain. Our tantalum ore supply requirements are now met through our direct sourcing partners of conflict free tantalum, which is then processed into the intermediate product potassium heptafluorotantalate (commonly known as K-salt) at our own facility in Mexico or at third party locations, before final processing into tantalum powder at KBP operations in Carson City, Nevada or Matamoros, Mexico. Price increases for tantalum ore, or for the remaining tantalum powder that we source from third parties, could impact our financial performance as we may not be able to pass all such price increases on to our customers. We estimate that our vertical integration strategy has created $50.0 million of cost savings per year.
Silver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities, and we believe there are enough suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements. An increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers, could, however, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Patents and Trademarks
As of March 31, 2019, we held the following number of patents and trademarks:
 | Patents | Trademarks
United States | 323 | | 17 
Foreign | 1,025 | | 260

Many of our patents and trademarks were obtained as part of the TOKIN acquisition. We believe the success of our business is not materially dependent on the existence or duration of any individual patent, license, or trademark other than the trademarks “KEMET,” “KEMET Charged,” and "TOKIN". Our engineering and research and development staffs have developed and continue to develop proprietary manufacturing processes and equipment designed to enhance our manufacturing facilities and reduce costs.
Segment Reporting
We are organized into three reportable segments: Solid Capacitors, Film and Electrolytic and Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators. Each reportable segment is responsible for the operations of certain manufacturing sites as well as all related research and development efforts. The sales, marketing and corporate functions are shared by each of the segments. See Note 7, “Reportable Segment and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for other information regarding the Company's reportable segments, including net sales, operating income, total assets, and financial information about geographic areas.
Solid Capacitors Reportable Segment
Solid Capacitors operates in ten manufacturing sites in the United States, Mexico and Asia and operates innovation centers in the United States and Japan. Solid Capacitors primarily produces tantalum, aluminum, polymer and ceramic capacitors which are sold globally. Solid Capacitors also produces tantalum powder used in the production of tantalum capacitors. Solid Capacitors employs approximately 8,000 employees worldwide. For fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, Solid Capacitors had consolidated net sales of $935.8 million, $771.2 million and $575.1 million, respectively.
We continue to make significant investments in tantalum production within Solid Capacitors and, based on net sales, we believe we are the largest tantalum capacitor manufacturer in the world. We believe we have one of the broadest lines of tantalum product offerings and are one of the leaders in the growing market for high-frequency low equivalent series resistance (“ESR”) surface mount tantalum and aluminum polymer capacitors. 
We believe KBP, which we acquired in 2012, is the largest production facility for tantalum powder in the western hemisphere. Since the acquisition of KBP, KEMET has been able to stabilize its tantalum powder costs and significantly 
11

improve its operating margin through its vertical integration efforts. The Company continues to streamline its vertical integration strategy and may take actions to improve the cost structure if the anticipated results are advantageous. The Company is currently in the process of relocating its tantalum powder facility equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its existing Matamoros, Mexico plant. 
Our tantalum product line has a broad product portfolio with industry leading processes and materials technology, a global manufacturing base, and on-time delivery capabilities that allow us to serve a wide range of customers in a diverse group of end markets, including computing, telecommunications, consumer, medical, military, automotive, and general industries. KEMET is a market leader in Polymer Tantalum, with an estimated market share of greater than 50.0%. 
Within our ceramic product line, we are making significant investments to support future MLCC growth. KEMET is a global and well known MLCC supplier in the automotive, industrial, medical, energy, defense and aerospace markets. Due to the extended global shortage of ceramic capacitors that began in 2016, customers are looking to KEMET as a long-term stable MLCC supplier to support their growth. The Company has entered into agreements with three of its largest customers pursuant to which the customers have agreed to provide interest free loans to the Company in exchange for assurance of future supply. These interest free loans are being used by the Company to fund the purchase of certain production equipment and to make other investments and improvements in the Company and its operations in order to increase its overall capacity to produce various electronic components. We are continuing to work with many of our other customers to help them secure future MLCC supply.
Our ceramic product line offers an extensive line of MLCC's in a variety of sizes and configurations. Our high voltage, high temperature and ultra-stable dielectric technology provides us with what we believe to be a significant advantage over many of our competitors, particularly in the high reliability markets mentioned. We are increasing investments in research and development to extend our current portfolio, as well as to be able to offer more effective high-density packaging solutions for connecting multiple components. We are also working with our customers to design-in our products with a focus on the growing automotive segment. 
Film and Electrolytic Reportable Segment
Our Film and Electrolytic Reportable Segment produces film, paper and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In addition, the segment designs and produces electromagnetic interference filters ("EMI filters"). Film capacitors can be used for applications requiring high power and high voltages, whereas aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used for applications requiring high energy at a reasonable price. EMI filters consist of capacitive and inductive elements that reduce electromagnetic disturbance in the frequency range desired. We believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of film capacitors and one of the leaders in wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Both product families serve industrial and automotive customers, and in particular, the emerging market for alternative energy and electrical vehicles. For fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, our Film and Electrolytic segment had consolidated net sales of $206.2 million, $202.0 million, and $182.2 million, respectively. Our Film and Electrolytic business is mostly concentrated in Europe, and as such, is impacted by the change in the exchange rate for the Euro to the U.S. dollar. 
Our Film and Electrolytic Reportable Segment primarily serves the industrial and automotive markets. We believe our Film and Electrolytic Segment’s product portfolio, technology and experience allow us to significantly benefit from the continued growth in alternative energy solutions and energy efficiency solutions within both the automotive and industrial markets especially for demanding applications such as humidity, temperature, voltage, etc. We operate nine manufacturing sites throughout Europe and Asia and maintain product innovation centers in Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Our Film and Electrolytic Segment employs approximately 1,750 employees worldwide.
The Company is in the process of relocating axial electrolytic production from Granna, Sweden to its plant in Evora, Portugal. The Company is streamlining its manufacturing operations for axial electrolytic capacitors with this relocation, allowing the Company to increase flexibility, capabilities, and competitiveness in the marketplace.
Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators Reportable Segment
MSA operates in four manufacturing sites throughout Asia and operates a product innovation center in Japan. MSA was a new reportable segment for KEMET in fiscal year 2018 resulting from the acquisition of TOKIN in April 2017. MSA primarily produces EMC materials and devices, piezo materials and actuators and various types of sensors which are sold globally. For fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our MSA Segment had consolidated net sales of $240.7 million and $227.0 million, respectively. MSA is aiming to sell products globally. Currently, most of MSA's net sales come from Japan, Korea, and other countries in Asia. Our MSA segment employs approximately 3,000 employees worldwide. 
The EMC device product line offers a broad line of electrical noise management products. As circuits become more complex within a device, and the amount of information being communicated between devices increases at a dramatic rate, the

quality of electronic signals becomes key to the integrity of the information being communicated. EMC products play a key role in maintaining signal integrity across a number of end-markets including telecommunications, mobile computing, automotive and general industries.
The sensor and actuator product line manufactures products that sense and respond to human activity, physical vibration, and electric current. These products are found in home appliances, consumer devices, and industrial electrical equipment. In addition, we manufacture electromechanical actuation devices that are critical to the manufacture of semiconductor devices and the management of industrial and chemical gas flow. Sensors are an important family of devices as the “internet-of-things” continues to permeate everyday life.
Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
We are subject to various North American, European, and Asian national, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the handling and management of certain chemicals and materials used and generated in the manufacturing of electronic components. We do not believe compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, we believe it is reasonably likely the trend in environmental litigation, laws, and regulations will continue to move toward stricter standards. Such changes in the laws and regulations may require us to make additional capital expenditures which, while not currently estimable with certainty, are not presently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
 We are strongly committed to economic, environmental, and socially sustainable development. As a result of this commitment, in 2008 we adopted the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) Code of Conduct, now titled Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA") Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct is a comprehensive code of conduct that addresses all aspects of corporate responsibility including labor, health and safety, the environment, business ethics, and related management system elements. It outlines standards to ensure working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe, free from slavery and human trafficking, workers are treated with respect and dignity, manufacturing processes are environmentally sustainable, materials are sourced responsibly, and business operations are conducted ethically.
Policies, programs, and procedures implemented throughout KEMET are intended to ensure conformity with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the content of the RBA Code of Conduct, and customer contractual requirements related to social and environmental responsibility.
We fully support the position of the RBA, the Responsible Minerals Initiative ("RMI"), and the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center (“TIC”) in avoiding the use of conflict minerals which directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its adjoining countries, or in any region determined to be a conflict affected and high-risk area. In furtherance of this support, we have utilized the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas as the foundation for KEMET's supply chain policy by implementing the five-step risk-based framework due diligence in our mineral supply chain. This supply chain policy and requirement has been communicated to all suppliers of conflict minerals and is communicated publicly on our website. Our tantalum supply base has been and continues to be validated as conformant to the RMI's Responsible Minerals Assurance Program ("RMAP"). We will continue to work through the RMI and TIC towards the goal of greater transparency in the supply chain.
In April 2019, KEMET published its first Corporate Sustainability Report (“CSR”), outlining its commitment towards the environment, its employees, and the communities within it operates. 
Summary of Activities to Develop a Transparent Supply Chain
We are actively involved in developing a transparent supply chain through our membership in the RMI. We were a member of the EICC Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“GeSI”) working group that developed the original Conflict Free Sourcing Program assessment protocols and we participated in the pilot implementation phase of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. We participate in smelter engagement to increase the number of conflict-free validated smelters globally, the development of due diligence guidance documents and the advancement of the industry adopted RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template. We rely on the RMAP independent third-party audits to supplement our internal due diligence of conflict mineral suppliers and are monitoring the progress of these audits to ensure our supply chain is conflict free. We fully support Section 1502 “Conflict Minerals” of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and are complying with all reporting requirements.
