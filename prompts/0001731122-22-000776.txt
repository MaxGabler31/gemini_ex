Principal Products and Services
 
All of our proprietary formulations contain clean, vegan, ethically and environmentally responsible ingredients. The Company currently has one main product line, and another in development. The Company’s current active product line is Oeuvre.
 
Oeuvre
 
Oeuvre - “A Body of Art” – is a next generation CBD luxury skin care line and lifestyle brand. The foundation of our system of products is our proprietary OE Complex: Botanicals + Gemstones + Full flower Hemp infused formulation. Each product in the Oeuvre Artistry Collection optimizes three functions: cellular energy, moisture balance, and nutrient utilization. Four products comprise the Oeuvre collection:
 

● | Purifying Exfoliator 
--+----------------------------
● | Replenishing Facial Oil 
● | Ultra-Nourishing Face Cream
● | Revitalizing Eye Cream 

 
Drawing inspiration from petals, leaves, roots, minerals and gemstones, Oeuvre celebrates the artistry of well-being and beauty, inside and out. Oeuvre products are non-toxic, ungendered products made with zero GMO, retinyl palmitate, petroleum, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates, and synthetic colors.
 
Oeuvre Target Market
 
Oeuvre is our luxury segment product line. With Oeuvre, we are targeting a large and influential consumer class of individuals that are “HENRYs” – High-Earners-Not-Rich-Yet. They have discretionary income and are highly likely to be wealthy in the future. HENRYs earn between $100,000 and $250,000 annually. They are digitally fluent, love online shopping online, and are big discretionary spenders. Therefore, ouvreskincare.com offers inclusive, aspirationally affordable luxury products positioned for them.
 
We believe the benefit of onboarding this demographic to Oeuvre are twofold: securing valuable present customers and building relationships and business with those most likely to be amongst the most affluent consumers in the future. By the year 2025, Millennials and Generation Z will represent more than 40% of the overall luxury goods market, according to a 2019 report published by Boston Consulting Group. We seek to target such group for the sale of our Oeuvre products.
 
On social media, we target the following audiences for our Oeuvre brand:
 

● | Women aged 30+ 
--+----------------------------
● | Luxury Skincare Enthusiasts
● | CBD Enthusiasts

Introduction of Recreational THC Beverages
 
The Company plans on introducing a luxury lifestyle THC beverage brand in the future. Upon development, product formulation, brand concept, packaging, and marketing presentations will be designed to appeal to an upscale, sophisticated target audience. The Company is currently working with a formulator in developing unique formulation attributes to achieve specific desired effects. This product launch is anticipated in approximately the fourth quarter of 2022.
 
Integrating the Metaverse 
 
The Metaverse is a 3D experiential internet space focused on social connection in which users can interact with computer-generated virtual worlds across a range of technologies. The Company intends to integrate the Metaverse, including AI, Web 3.0 and non-fungible tokens (NFT’s), within our social media platforms and interactive product displays.
Suppliers
 
The Company has several third-party suppliers and is not reliant on any particular supplier for its product offerings. Many of our products contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis which we obtain from third parties. Hemp cultivation can be impacted by weather patterns and other natural events, but we have not yet faced any supply issues to date with obtaining raw materials for our products.
Distribution
 
We have two primary methods through which we sell our products:
 

1. | Direct to Consumer online e-commerce platform
---+----------------------------------------------
2. | Wholesale partners 

Marketing Strategy
 
We support our brand launches through social media and marketing campaigns, including utilizing influencers. Marketing and public relations firms are engaged by the Company to spearhead its launch of Oeuvre, and will likely be engaged for our future planned brand launches as well.
 
Sentient Brands Growth Strategies:
 
To grow our company, Sentient Brands intends to:
 

● | Create a leading consumer packaged goods company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Partner with established distributers and retailers; 
● | Focus on operational excellence and product quality; and
● | Establish ongoing communication with the capital markets

 
Our mission is to create the next generation of CBD/THC consumer brands. The Company believes it has assembled a highly accomplished team of branding and marketing professionals who have a combined experience and track record of successfully launching and operating major brands in the consumer market space, which the Company believes will provide it with it a competitive edge in its industry.

Customers
 
The Company launched its Oeuvre product line in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company’s sales channels are direct to consumer and wholesale.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company’s Oeuvre brand is trademarked in the United States, with a European trademark application pending. The Company expects to rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information, however we have not yet taken security measures to protect this information.
Competition
 
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies.
 
The current market for hemp-derived CBD products is highly competitive, consisting of publicly-trade and privately-owned companies, many of which are more adequately capitalized than the Company. The Company’s current publicly listed competitors include market leader Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences, Elixinol, Abacus, and Green Growth Brands, and private companies such as BeBoe, St. Jane. Mary’s, Lord Jones, Bluebird Folium Biosciences, Global Cannabinoids, and Pure Kana. In addition, public and private U.S. and Canadian companies have entered the hemp-derived CBD consumer market or have announced plans to do so. This market is highly fragmented, and according to the Hemp Business Journal, the vast majority of industry participants generate less than $2 million in annual revenue. We see this an opportunity to get a foothold in the CBD consumer marketplace with the goal of building Sentient Brands as a major brand name in this space.
Industry Overview
 
The market for products based on extracts of hemp and cannabis, is expected to grow substantially over the coming years. Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics are forecasting the combined market to reach nearly $45 billion within the U.S. in the year 2024. While much of this market is expected to be comprised of high potency THC-based products that will be sold in licensed dispensaries, certain research firms are still predicting the market to grow to $5.3 billion, $12.6 billion, and $2.2 billion by 2024 in the product areas of low THC cannabinoids, THC-free Cannabinoids and pharmaceutical cannabinoids, respectively.
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill.” Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a Schedule I controlled substances, and illegal under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis or marijuana under federal law and thus would face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.

Recent Developments
 
Covid-19
 
A novel strain of coronavirus (“Covid-19”) emerged globally in December 2019 and has been declared a pandemic. The extent to which Covid-19 will impact our customers, business, results and financial condition will depend on current and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. While the Company’s day-to-day operations beginning March 2020 through the 2021 fiscal year have been impacted, we have suffered less immediate impact as most staff can work remotely and can continue to develop our product offerings.
 
On April 18, 2020, the Company, through its subsidiary Jaguaring Company, entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note and Agreement with KeyBank National Association, pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $231,500 (the “PPP Loan”). The PPP Loan was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the PPP Loan is two years with a maturity date of April 18, 2022 and contains a favorable fixed annual interest rate of 1.00%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan will be deferred for the first six months of the term of the PPP Loan until November 18, 2020. Principal and interest are payable monthly and may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and receive forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs (collectively, “Qualifying Expenses”), and on the maintenance of employee and compensation levels during the eight-week period following the funding of the PPP Loan. The Company has been using the proceeds of the PPP Loan, for Qualifying Expenses. On December 8, 2021 the Company received notification from Key Bank that our forgiveness application has been approved in full by the Small Business Administration, or SBA.
 
Forward Stock Split / Increase of Authorized / Name Change / Migratory Merger
 
On December 9, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation (the “Certificate”) with the State of California to (i) effect a forward stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 7 for 1 (the “Forward Stock Split”), (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 50,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, and (iii) effectuate a name change (the “Name Change”). Fractional shares that resulted from the Forward Stock Split were rounded up to the next highest number. As a result of the Name Change, the Company’s name changed from “Intelligent Buying, Inc.” to “Sentient Brands Holdings Inc.”. The Certificate was approved by the majority of the Company’s shareholders and by the Board of Directors of the Company. The effective date of the Forward Stock Split and the Name Change was March 2, 2021.
 
In connection with the above, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Forward Stock Split and the Name Change was implemented by FINRA on March 2, 2021. Our symbol on OTC Markets was INTBD for 20 business days from March 2, 2021 (the “Notification Period”). Our new CUSIP number is 81728V 102. As a result of the name change, our symbol was changed to “SNBH” following the Notification Period.
 
In addition, on January 29, 2021, the Company, merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, Sentient Brands Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger between Sentient Brands Holdings Inc., a California corporation, and Sentient Brands Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation. Sentient Brands Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation, continued as the surviving entity of the migratory merger. Pursuant to the migratory merger, the Company changed its state of incorporation from California to Nevada and each share of its common stock converted into one share of common stock of the surviving entity in the migratory merger. No dissenters’ rights were exercised by any of the Company’s stockholders in connection with the migratory merger.
 
Following the consummation of the migratory merger, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Nevada corporation that was newly created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company became the articles of incorporation and bylaws for the surviving entity in the migratory merger.

Government Regulation
 
The United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood and blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.
 
Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.
 
Aside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and (5) daily use information.
 
The FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA, concerning any of our products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis. Further, our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.
 
Government Approvals
 
The Company does not currently require any government approvals for its operations or product offerings. In August 2019, the DEA affirmed that CBD preparations at or below the 0.3 percent delta-9 THC threshold, is not a controlled substance, and a DEA registration is not required. As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has been tasked with developing CBD regulations. The FDA has not yet published regulations.
Research and Development
 
We are continuously in the process of identifying and/or developing potential new products to offer to our customers. Our expenditures on research and development have historically been small and immaterial compared to our other business expenditures. We are currently developing new formulations for additional product lines.
Employees
 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. As of April 15, 2022, we employed two full-time employees. The Company otherwise currently relies on the services of independent contractors. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be in good standing. Although we continually seek to add additional talent to our work force, management believes that it currently has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance.
 
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees, including our specialized technical staff, are working from home or in a virtual environment unless they have a requirement to be in the office for short-term tasks and projects.

Company History
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of California on March 22, 2004. The Company was initially engaged in the business of asset management and sales of high-end computerized networking equipment to emerging high technology companies. Commencing in 2011, the Company began providing advertising services to promote products and services of third parties (primarily a related company, Anchorfree Wireless, Inc.) to the Company’s customer base. Under this business model, third parties paid the Company a fee to disseminate their advertising to the Company’s customer base. On February 9, 2015, the Company’s principal shareholders sold their shares of common stock to AMS Encino Investments, Inc., a California corporation controlled by Hector Guerrero, which resulted in a change of control of the Company. Following this change of control, in October 2016, management discontinued the Company’s operations.
 
On March 13, 2019, we entered into a Reorganization Agreement by and among Jaguaring Company, d/b/a Cannavolve (“Cannavolve”), a Washington corporation, and the shareholders of Cannavolve listed in the Reorganization Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cannavolve from these Cannavolve shareholders in exchange for up to 861,738 shares of common stock of the Company. On April 27, 2019, and again on January 2, 2020, the Reorganization Agreement was amended. The Reorganization Agreement and its subsequent amendments are referred to herein collectively as the “Reorganization Agreement.” On February 12, 2020, the parties to the Reorganization Agreement entered into a termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which the Reorganization Agreement was terminated by mutual consent of the parties in accordance with the terms of the Reorganization Agreement. The parties decided to terminate the Reorganization Agreement in order to restructure the planned acquisition by the Company of Cannavolve. The foregoing description of the Termination Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Termination Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.5 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) and which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On February 14, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into and closed (the “Closing”) an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Agreement”) with Cannavolve and each of the 37 shareholders of Cannavolve who executed a counterpart signature to the Agreement (the “Cannavolve Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire an aggregate of 33,674,262 shares of common stock of Cannavolve constituting 81.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cannavolve from the Cannavolve Shareholders in exchange for 702,111 shares of common stock of the Company, constituting 9.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company (the “Reorganization “). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to file a Certificate of Determination with the State of California, as soon as practicable after the Closing, to create a new class of preferred stock of the Company, the Series B Preferred Stock (the “New Preferred”), and further agreed to issue, as a post-Closing covenant, 1,000,000 shares of the New Preferred to Principal Holdings, LLC (“Principal”), in consideration of Principal successfully negotiating the Agreement and performing due-diligence in connection with the Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company’s then principal shareholder, Bagel Hole Inc. (“Bagel Hole”), which is owned solely by Philip Romanzi, the Company’s Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and sole director, would return to the Company for cancellation and retirement an aggregate of 4,114,352 shares of Common Stock owned by Bagel Hole. Additionally, pursuant to the Agreement, the parties agreed that at Closing, (i) Mr. Romanzi would resign from all executive officer and director positions with the Company, (ii) George Furlan would be appointed as the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Interim Treasurer, Interim Secretary and Chief Operating Officer, and (iii) Dante Jones would be appointed as the Company’s sole director. Further, the parties agreed that two additional directors would be appointed to the Company’s board of directors after Closing.

At Closing pursuant to the Agreement: (i) we issued an aggregate of 702,111 shares of Common Stock to the Cannavolve Shareholders in exchange for 33,674,262 shares of Cannavolve common stock, constituting 81.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannavolve, resulting in Cannavolve becoming our 81.5% owned subsidiary; (ii) Bagel Hole returned to the Company for cancellation and retirement 4,114,352 shares of Common Stock owned by Bagel Hole; (iii) Mr. Romanzi resigned from all officer and director positions with the Company; (iv) George Furlan was appointed as the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Interim Treasurer, Interim Secretary and Chief Operating Officer; and (v) Dante Jones was appointed as the Company’s sole director.
 
The Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and conditions for a transaction of this type for the benefit of the parties. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Reorganization qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). However, we did not obtain any tax opinion and there can be no assurance that our intent that the Reorganization qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code is correct.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to Form 8-K on February 14, 2020 and which is incorporated herein by reference. Immediately prior to the Closing of the Reorganization described in detail above pursuant to which Cannavolve became a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company was a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
The Reorganization was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and Cannavolve. The acquisition method of accounting is set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are generally recorded as of the completion of the purchase at their respective fair values and added to those of the Company. Financial statements and reported results of operations of the Company issued after completion of the purchase will reflect these fair value adjustments, but the Company’s previously issued historical financial statements will not be retroactively restated.
 
In addition, on May 28, 2020, the Company entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with the remaining 55 shareholders of Cannavolve (the “Remaining Cannavolve Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired an aggregate of 7,656,441 shares of common stock of Cannavolve constituting the remaining 18.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cannavolve from the Remaining Cannavolve Shareholders in exchange for 159,627 shares of common stock of the Company, constituting 0.02% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Cannavolve is a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company. Additionally, On May 28, 2020, Mr. Furlan was appointed as a Director of the Company. We anticipate that, in the near future, the size of the Board will be increased to three directors.
 
The Share Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and conditions for a transaction of this type for the benefit of the parties. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Share Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. However, we did not obtain any tax opinion and there can be no assurance that our intent that the Share Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code is correct.

The foregoing description of the Share Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an Exhibit to this Form 10-K Annual Report. Readers should review those exhibits for a complete understanding of the terms and conditions associated with this matter.
 
The offers, sales, and issuances of the securities described above were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and/or Rule 506 as promulgated under Regulation D as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these transactions. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions was an accredited or sophisticated person and had adequate access, through employment, business or other relationships, to information about us.
 
The Share Exchange was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and Cannavolve. The acquisition method of accounting is set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are generally recorded as of the completion of the purchase at their respective fair values and added to those of the Company. Financial statements and reported results of operations of the Company issued after completion of the purchase will reflect these fair value adjustments, but the Company’s previously issued historical financial statements will not be retroactively restated.
