Our Customers
Our revenues are substantially dependent on Boeing and Airbus. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, approximately 56% and 24% of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, approximately 60% and 23% of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. We are currently the sole-source supplier for nearly all of the products we sell to Boeing and Airbus. 
Boeing
We are the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to Boeing and manufacture aerostructures for every Boeing commercial aircraft currently in production, including the majority of the airframe content for the Boeing B737, and multiple significant structural components of the Boeing B787. We supply these products through long-term supply agreements that cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. These supply agreements are described in more detail under “Our Relationship with Boeing” below. We believe our relationship with Boeing will allow us to continue to be an integral partner with Boeing in the designing, engineering, and manufacturing of complex aerostructures.
Airbus
We originally became a supplier to Airbus in April 2006 through the acquisition of BAE Aerostructures and subsequently won additional work packages with Airbus. Our business with Airbus increased substantially with the acquisition of Bombardier's aerostructures assets in Belfast and Morocco on October 30, 2020. We are one of the largest content suppliers of wing systems for the Airbus A320 family and a significant supplier for the Airbus A350 XWB. Under our supply agreement with Airbus for the A320 and A330, we supply products for the life of the aircraft program. For the A350 XWB program, we have long-term requirement contracts with Airbus. In addition, we build the fully integrated wing for the A220 aircraft. We believe we can leverage our relationship with Airbus and our history of delivering high-quality products to further increase our sales to Airbus and continue to partner with Airbus on new programs going forward.
Other Customers
Other customers include Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. 
U.S. and International Customer Mix
Although most of our revenues are obtained from sales inside the U.S., we generated $1,130.8 million, $767.2 million, and $1,296.8 million in sales to international customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, primarily to Airbus. The international revenue is included primarily in the Commercial segment. All other segment revenues are primarily from U.S. sales. Approximately 19% of our long-lived assets based on book value are located in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") with approximately another 4% of our long-lived assets located in countries outside the U.S. and the U.K. A significant amount of our Aftermarket segment net revenues represent sales to international customers, primarily out of our Belfast, Northern Ireland location. 
Our Relationship with Boeing 
A significant portion of Spirit’s operations related to Boeing aerostructures was owned and controlled by Boeing until 2005. On February 7, 2005, Spirit Holdings became a standalone Delaware company, and commenced operations on June 17, 2005 through the acquisition of Boeing’s operations in Wichita, Kansas, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and McAlester, Oklahoma (the “Boeing Acquisition”) by an investor group led by Onex Partners LP and Onex Corporation (together with its affiliates, “Onex”). As of August 2014, Onex no longer held any investment in the Company. Boeing’s commercial aerostructures manufacturing operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, are referred to in this Annual Report as “Boeing Wichita.” 
In connection with the Boeing Acquisition, we entered into long-term supply agreements under which we are Boeing’s exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita to Boeing prior to the Boeing acquisition. These supply agreements include products for Boeing’s B737, B747, B767, and B777 commercial aircraft programs, as well as for certain products for Boeing’s B787 program. These supply agreements cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models.
Supply Agreement with Boeing for B737, B747, B767, and B777 Programs ("Sustaining Programs")
Overview. Two documents effectively comprise the Sustaining Programs’ supply contract: (1) the Special Business Provisions (“Sustaining SBP”), which sets forth the specific terms of the Sustaining Programs’ supply arrangement, and (2) the General Terms Agreement (“Sustaining GTA,” and, together with the Sustaining SBP (and any related purchase order or 
contract), as amended, the “Sustaining Agreement”), which sets forth other general contractual provisions, including provisions relating to termination, events of default, assignment, ordering procedures, inspections, and quality controls. 
The Sustaining Agreement is a requirements contract that covers certain products, including fuselages, struts/pylons, and nacelles (including thrust reversers), wings and wing components, as well as tooling, for the Sustaining Programs for the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. During the term of the Sustaining Agreement, and absent a default by Spirit, Boeing is obligated to purchase from Spirit all of its requirements for products covered by the Sustaining Agreement. Although Boeing is not required to maintain a minimum production rate, Boeing is subject to a maximum production rate above which it must negotiate with us regarding responsibility for recurring and non-recurring expenditures related to any agreed capacity increase. Boeing owns substantially all of the Boeing product-specific tooling used in production or inspection of products covered by the Sustaining Agreement.
Pricing. On September 22, 2017, Boeing and Spirit entered into Amendment 30 to the Sustaining SBP that generally established pricing terms for the Sustaining Program models (excluding the B777X) through December 31, 2022 (with certain limited exceptions) and provided that Boeing and Spirit would negotiate follow-on pricing for periods beyond January 1, 2023 beginning 24 months prior to January 1, 2023. In addition, the amendment provided that the parties would make certain investments for rate increases on the B737 program and implemented updated payment terms.
On December 21, 2018, Boeing and Spirit executed a Collective Resolution 2.0 Memorandum of Agreement (the “2018 MOA”). The 2018 MOA established, among other items, pricing for certain programs through December 31, 2030, including the B737NG (including the P8), B737 MAX, B767 (but excluding 767-2C for which pricing is separately established), and the B777 freighters and 777-9 (pricing for the B777 300ER and 200LR was previously established and pricing for the B777-8 is subject to future negotiation). In addition, the 2018 MOA established B737 pricing based on production rates above and below current production levels, investments for tooling and capital for certain B737 rate increases, a joint cost reduction program for the B777X (a joint cost reduction program for the B737 is separately established), and the release of certain liabilities and claims asserted by both parties, including the B737 disruption activity claim. The parties further agreed to reconvene in 2028 to negotiate pricing beyond 2030. Consistent with the 2018 MOA, on January 30, 2019, Boeing and Spirit executed SBP Amendment 40 to implement the December 2018 MOA terms and conditions applicable to the Sustaining Programs.
On February 6, 2020, Boeing and Spirit entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the “2020 MOA”) extending B737 MAX pricing terms through 2033 (previously, the pricing was through December 31, 2030) and updated payment terms.
Advances on the B737 Program. On April 12, 2019, Boeing and the Company executed a Memorandum of Agreement (the “2019 MOA”). Under the 2019 MOA, the Company received an advance payment from Boeing in the amount of $123 million during the third quarter of 2019. The 2020 MOA provided that the $123 million advance would be repaid by offset against the purchase price for year 2022 shipset deliveries. In addition, the 2020 MOA provided that Boeing will pay $225 million to Spirit in the first quarter of 2020, consisting of (i) $70 million in support of Spirit’s inventory and production stabilization, of which $10 million was repaid by Spirit in 2021, and (ii) $155 million as an incremental pre-payment for costs and shipset deliveries over the next two years. These payments were made to Spirit on February 6, 2020. On February 9, 2021, Spirit signed a letter of agreement for Boeing to pay $38.5 million to Spirit in the first quarter of 2021, which consisted of (i) $68.5 million as additional pre-payment for the costs and shipset deliveries less the (ii) ($30) million credit owed to Boeing for rate-based pricing premium. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of advance payments received from Boeing and not yet repaid was $123 million.
Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to initiate or continue production of a Sustaining Program model or commercial derivative because it determines there is insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate such model or derivative, including any order therefore, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing would be liable to Spirit for any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs.
Events of Default and Remedies. Events of default under the Sustaining Agreement include Spirit’s failure to deliver products when and as required, and failure to maintain a required system of quality assurance, among other things. Certain events of default may allow Boeing to cancel orders under or terminate the Sustaining Agreement.
Intellectual Property. All technical work product and works of authorship produced by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Sustaining Agreement are the exclusive property of Boeing. All inventions conceived by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Sustaining Agreement and any patents claiming such inventions are the exclusive property of Spirit, except that Boeing will own any such inventions that Boeing reasonably believes are applicable to the B787 Program, and Boeing may seek patent protection for such B787 inventions or hold them as trade secrets; provided that, if Boeing does not seek patent protection, Spirit may do so.
B787 Supply Agreement with Boeing (“B787 Program”)
Overview. Two documents effectively comprise the B787 Program supply contract: (1) the Special Business Provisions (“787 SBP”), which sets forth the specific terms of the B787 Program’s supply arrangement and (2) the General Terms Agreement (“787 GTA,” and, together with 787 SBP and (any related purchase order or contract), as amended, the “B787 Agreement”), which sets forth other general contractual provisions, including provisions relating to termination, events of default, assignment, ordering procedures, inspections, and quality controls. The B787 Agreement is a requirements contract pursuant to which Spirit is Boeing’s exclusive supplier for the forward fuselage, fixed, and movable leading wing edges, engine pylons, and related tooling for the B787.
Pricing. On September 22, 2017, Boeing and Spirit entered into Amendment 25 to the B787 Agreement that established pricing terms for the B787-8, -9, and -10 models through line unit 1405 and provided that Boeing and Spirit would negotiate follow-on pricing for line units 1406 and beyond beginning 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for line unit 1405. The amendment also implemented updated payment terms and required the Company to repay Boeing $236 million less certain adjustments, as a retroactive adjustment for payments that were based on interim pricing. This amount was repaid in October 2017.
On December 21, 2018, Boeing and Spirit executed the 2018 MOA, which also established, among other things, pricing for the B787 for line unit 1004 through line unit 2205, and agreed to establish a joint cost reduction program for the B787. Consistent with the 2018 MOA, on January 30, 2019, Boeing and Spirit executed Amendment 28 to the B787 Agreement to implement the 2018 MOA terms and conditions applicable to the B787 Program.
Advance Payments. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Agreement, which are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offsets against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. Advance repayments were scheduled to be spread evenly over the remainder of the first 1,000 B787 shipsets delivered to Boeing, except that pursuant to an amendment to the B787 Agreement entered into in April 2014, advance repayments were suspended from April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and any repayments that otherwise would have become due during such 12-month period will be made by offset against the purchase price for shipset 1,001 through 1,120. Repayments resumed in 2015. The 2018 MOA also provided for the suspension of advance repayments with respect to the B787 beginning with line number 818; to resume at a lower rate of $450,319 per shipset at line number 1135 and continue through line number 1605. 
In the event Boeing does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets to repay the full amount of advances prior to the termination of the B787 Program or the B787 Agreement, any advances not then repaid will be applied against any outstanding payments then due by Boeing to us, and any remaining balance will be repaid in annual installments of $27 million due on December 15th of each year until the advance payments have been fully recovered by Boeing. Accordingly, portions of the advance repayment liability are included as current and long-term liabilities in our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing not yet repaid was $212.1 million.
Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to continue production of the B787 Program because it determines, after consultation with Spirit, that there is an insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate the B787 Program, including any orders, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing will be liable to Spirit for costs incurred in connection with any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs and for compensation for any tools, raw materials or work-in-process requested by Boeing in connection with the termination.
Events of Default and Remedies. Events of default under the B787 Agreement include Spirit’s failure to deliver products when and as required, and failure to maintain a required system of quality assurance, among other things. Certain events of default may allow Boeing to cancel orders under or terminate the B787 Agreement.
Intellectual Property. The B787 Agreement established three classifications for patented invention and proprietary information: (1) intellectual property developed by Spirit during activity under the B787 Agreement (“Spirit IP”); (2) intellectual property developed jointly by Boeing and Spirit during that activity (“Joint IP”); and (3) all other intellectual property developed during activity under the B787 Agreement (“Boeing IP”).
Boeing may use Spirit IP for work on the B787 Program and Spirit must license it to third parties for work on such program. Each party is free to use Joint IP in connection with work on the B787 Program and other Boeing programs, but each must obtain the consent of the other to use it for other purposes. Spirit is entitled to use Boeing IP for the B787 Program, and may require Boeing to license it to subcontractors for the same purpose.
The foregoing descriptions of the various agreements between Spirit and Boeing do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement as filed with the SEC, subject to certain omissions of 
confidential portions pursuant to requests for confidential treatment filed separately with the SEC. Please see Item 15 to this Annual Report. 
Intellectual Property 
We have several patents pertaining to our processes and products. No individual patent or group of patents is of material importance. We also rely on trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, unpatented knowledge, creative products development, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position.
Competition
Although we are one of the largest independent non-OEM aerostructures suppliers based on annual revenues, with an estimated 15% share of the global non-OEM aerostructures market, this market remains highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition currently comes from either work performed internally by OEMs or other tier-one suppliers, and direct competition continues to grow. The Company continues to focus on design and manufacturing processes and tools, and cost reduction initiatives. The Company intends to compete by optimizing parts fabricated and assembled by the Company versus parts outsourced from the supply chain. Additionally, we compete by developing technologies and processes that leverage the Company's unique knowledge and capabilities to create value for our customers. 
In commercial aerostructures, our principal competitors among OEMs include Boeing, Airbus (including its wholly-owned subsidiaries Airbus Atlantic and Premium Aerotec GmbH), and Leonardo. 
Our principal competitors among non-OEM tier-1 aerostructures suppliers include Aernnova, GKN Aerospace, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Safran Nacelles, Sonaca, Airbus Atlantic, Premium AEROTEC, Triumph Group, Inc. (“Triumph”), and Latecoere S.A.
The Company continues to build a larger presence in the defense aerostructures market. The Company's competition in defense aerostructures includes Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon United Technologies, Leonardo, GKN, Triumph, BAE Systems, Korea Aerospace Industries, and Turkish Aerospace Industries.
Expected Backlog
As of December 31, 2021, our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft, business and regional jets, and military equipment deliveries, calculated based on contractual and historical product prices and expected delivery volumes, was approximately $34.6 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion from our corresponding estimate as of December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily driven by increases to the expected backlog of the B737 MAX program. A significant majority of our backlog is on programs in our Commercial segment. The B737 MAX program backlog is approximately 58% of our total backlog. The A320 program backlog is approximately 13% of our total backlog. Backlog is calculated based on Boeing’s and Airbus’ announced backlog on our supply agreements (which are based on orders from customers), and the number of units the Company is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts. The number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment, depending on contract terms. For example, our contract with Boeing for the B737 MAX program is a requirements contract, and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time. The level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders, and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, our expected backlog as of December 31, 2021 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period. For additional information on backlog, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business - Our backlog is subject to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors.”
Suppliers and Materials
The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing operations are aluminum, titanium, steel, and carbon fiber. We also purchase metallic parts, non-metallic parts, and machined components. In addition, we procure subassemblies from various manufacturers that are used in the final aerostructure assembly. From time to time, we also review our make-versus-buy strategy to determine whether it would be beneficial to us and/or our customers to outsource work that we currently produce in-house or vice versa.
We have long-standing relationships with hundreds of manufacturing suppliers. Our strategy is to enter into long-term contracts with suppliers to secure competitive pricing. Our exposure to rising costs of raw material is limited to some extent through leveraging relationships with our OEM customers’ high-volume contracts.
We continue to seek and develop sourcing opportunities in North America, Europe, and Asia to achieve a competitive global cost structure. Over 25 countries are represented in our international network of suppliers.
For additional information on our suppliers, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”
Research and Development
We believe that a world-class research and development focus helps maintain our position as an advanced partner to our OEM customers’ new product development teams and expand our position in emerging markets. As a result, our research and development spend was $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Through our research, we strive to develop unique intellectual property and technologies that will improve our products and our customers' products and, at the same time, position us to win work on new products. Our development efforts focus on improving manufacturing processes on our current work and developing new capability and affordable, industrialized technology targeting growth focused initiatives. It also serves as an ongoing process that helps develop ways to reduce production costs and streamline manufacturing processes.
Our research and development is geared toward the architectural design and manufacturing processes for our three business segments and aimed at enabling Spirit to utilize commercial scale and expertise to translate best practices to our growing defense and aftermarket businesses. We have identified seven Distinctive Capability areas (performance architectures, material optimization, product development tools, lean metallics, ultra-competitive composites, affordable tooling, and accelerated learning curves) that guide our research and development strategy to enable growth and sustainability. We are currently focused on research in areas such as advanced metallic joining, low-cost composites, acoustic attenuation, efficient structures, systems integration, advanced design and computational analysis methods, and new material systems. Other items that are expensed relate to research and development that is not funded by the customer. We collaborate with universities, research facilities, and technology partners in our research and development.
 For additional information on research and development, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our success depends in part on the success of our research and development initiatives.”
Regulatory Matters
Environmental. Our operations and facilities are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements governing, among other matters, the emission, discharge, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, and permits required in connection with our operations. We continually monitor our operations and facilities to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations; however, management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or the enforcement thereof, or the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure continued compliance. Further, we could incur substantial costs, including costs to reduce air emissions, clean-up costs, fines and sanctions, and third-party property damage, or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, capital expenditures, financial condition, competitive condition, or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air, and groundwater contamination are discovered, and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
Government Contracts. Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies, either directly or by subcontract, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate existing contracts, suspend, or debar us from receiving new prime contracts or subcontracts, reduce the value of existing contracts, audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, among other things. If a contract was terminated for convenience, we could recover the costs we have incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, if the termination is a result of our failure to perform, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the prime contractor in procuring undelivered items from another source. In addition, failure to follow the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (“NISPOM”) or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations could, among other things, result in termination of our facility securities clearances (each a "FCL"), which in turn would preclude us from being awarded classified contracts or, under certain circumstances, performing on our existing classified contracts.
Commercial Aircraft. The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA"), the European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”), and other agencies throughout the world. The 
military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services.
Export Control. The technical data and components used in the design and production of our products, as well as many of the products and technical data we export, either as individual items or as components incorporated into aircraft, are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers or suppliers, are also subject to U.S. export control laws.
Health and Safety. Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. Our management believes that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA’s health and safety requirements.

Values. The Company operates according to three key values that are designed to help it meet commitments to all stakeholders — employees, customers, suppliers, investors and communities. These values are: 
•Transparency - Being open, honest and respectful with communication; sharing ideas and building trust by making intentions clear; 
•Collaboration - Aligning actions with others; working together to achieve the best outcomes; and 
•Inspiration - Encouraging the best from others; leading by example to ensure innovation is a component of success.
The values are enabled through the foundation of Trust and Speak Out:
•Speak Out – Asking thoughtful questions to enhance understanding; encouraging active listening and considering diverse perspectives; sharing ideas to reach better decisions and achieve better outcomes.
Adopting and incorporating the Company's values into day-to-day tasks and activities enables the Company to be a trusted partner. Practicing transparency, collaboration and inspiration—individually and collectively—supports the Company's efforts to be customer focused, provide on-time delivery, and maintain and improve quality and safety for all. 
Code of Business Conduct. The Company is committed to the highest ethical standards and to complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s business. To support and articulate its commitment and responsibility in this regard, the Company has adopted the Code of Business Conduct (the “Code”). The Code addresses a number of topics, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, conflicts of interest, safeguarding assets, insider trading, and general adherence to laws and regulations. All directors and employees, including executive officers, must comply with the Code. The Code is available on the Company’s website at http://investor.spiritaero.com/corporate-governance/OD/default.aspx.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Company is committed to creating a world class workforce — actively working to build an equitable and inclusive culture, where all employees' diverse skills and talents are valued. The Company values the full range of differences, perspectives and abilities that our employees bring to the workplace. We strive to create an environment where all employees feel welcomed and have a sense of belonging.
The Company is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion not only because it is the right thing to do, but because greater diversity in an equitable and inclusive work environment results in greater innovation and growth. We believe that 
combining diverse perspectives helps the Company find new ways to solve problems and innovate for the future. The Company harnesses the power of diversity by:
•Aiming to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce;
•Integrating equitable and inclusive business practices and capabilities;
•Recognizing and respecting the diversity of the marketplace; and
•Working and partnering with vendors from a diverse supplier base.
Talent Management. The attraction, retention and development of employees is a critical success factor in meeting the Company's strategy. We seek to provide our employees opportunities for growth through formal and informal development programs that include: training, coaching and mentoring, networking, skills and experience and career planning. Spirit strives to create a culture of empowerment, engagement and performance through our core values. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles throughout the company. Our management and salaried retention rate was 95% (excluding retirements and reductions in force) in 2021.
Health and Safety. The Company takes steps to comply in all material respects with applicable legal, regulatory and other requirements related to preventing pollution, injury and ill health, and employs industry-leading, technologically sound and economically feasible control mechanisms, procedures and processes. In addition, the Company provides training, education, safety monitoring and auditing, health-awareness programs, and ergonomic support in the Company's offices and factories. We are committed to the safety and health of our employees and work to eliminate all injuries and accidents. We evaluate safety performance through multiple indicators, including OSHA recordable injury rates and lost-time incidents. 
COVID-19 Impact. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we enacted our crisis management and response process as part of our enterprise risk management program. As we continue to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to new COVID-19 variants, actions we have taken include the following:
•Organizing global teams to monitor the situation and recommend appropriate actions;
•Implementing and updating travel restrictions for our employees as appropriate;
•Initiating consistent and ongoing cleaning of high-touch work spaces; and
•Providing testing for symptomatic and potentially exposed individuals and implemented quarantines guidelines. 
Other actions taken in response to the pandemic are referenced elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining Agreements
Our principal U.S. collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions as of December 31, 2021:

Union | Percent of our U.S. Employees Represented | Status of the Agreements with Major Union 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) | 55% | We have two major agreements - one expires in June 2023 and one expires in December 2024. 
The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) | 21% | We have two major agreements - one expires in December 2024 and one expires in January 2026.

Approximately 92% of our Prestwick employees are part of the collective bargaining group represented by one union, Unite (Amicus Section). In 2013, the Company negotiated two separate ten-year pay agreements with the Manual Staff bargaining and the Monthly Staff bargaining groups of the Unite union. These agreements cover basic pay and variable at risk pay, while other employee terms and conditions generally remain the same from year to year until both parties agree to change them. The current pay agreements were set to expire December 31, 2022. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company negotiated and agreed with Unite, a three-year extension to the pay agreements which will run from January 2023 and expire in December 2025. The elements of the contract extension remain the same as those in the ten-year agreements.
In the U.K. (Belfast), approximately 84% of the employees are part of the collective group represented by the Trade Unions. Unite the Union is the largest representing approximately 93% of such employees, with General, Municipal, Boilermakers making up the balance. The last wage agreement covered the period from January 2016 to January 2019. No negotiations were held in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 and the acquisition of Shorts Brothers plc in late October 2020. Negotiations commenced in late 2021 and are ongoing.
In France, our employees are represented by CFTC (“Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens or French Confederation of Christian Workers”) and FO (“Force Ouvrière or Labor Force”). The Company negotiates yearly on compensation and once every four years on issues related to gender equality and work-life balance. The next election to determine union representation will occur in July 2023.
In Morocco, approximately 65% of our employees are represented by Union Marocain du Travail ("UMT"). We negotiated a three year agreement with UMT that expires in December 2022.
None of our Malaysia employees are currently represented by a union. 
We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
