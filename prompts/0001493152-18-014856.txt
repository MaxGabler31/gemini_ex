FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate” or “continue,” or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management’s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.

GENERAL 
 
Moveix Inc was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 2016, and our fiscal year end is May 31. The Company’s administrative address is Strada Veronica Micle 15 bl.17 sc A et 1 apt 6, Suceava, 720217 Romania, and our phone number is +40316304330.
 
We will buy the electric transportation products wholesale from Chinese manufacturers and sell these products via our website. We will concentrate our first year of operation in Europe, expanding our second year of operation to the North American market. Our main selling product will be the hoverboard. The two-wheeled self-balancing electric scooter is commonly referred to as a hoverboard, which is a type of portable, rechargeable battery-powered scooter. They typically consist of two wheels arranged side-by-side, with two small platforms between the wheels, on which the rider stands. The device is controlled by the rider’s feet, standing on the built-in gyroscopic and sensored pads. There is no universally accepted name for the device, as its various product names are attributable to the companies which distribute it and not its manufacturers.
 
Also we intend to resell electric bikes and segways.
 
Marketing Our Product
 
We plan to market our electric transportation products around the world. Initially, our products will be promoted by our President, Treasurer and sole director, Alexandru Curiliuc, though his network. We believe that other businesses in the recreational industry will be willing to market our products in addition to marketing their own products because we plan to offer individually negotiated sales commissions as an incentive to selling our products. There is no guarantee that other businesses will be willing to sell our products. We will follow up with these clients periodically and offer special discounts from time to time. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls, email, and regular mail. We will ask our satisfied clients for referrals.
 
We intend to hire a part time web site developer to design and launch our website. We will display our products on our website. The products will be available for purchase on our web site. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words (meta-tags) and utilizing link and banner exchange options. We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials.
 
To draw attention from potential customers we plan to market and advertise our company though social networking. We intend to use Facebook and Twitter to spread information about our products and services. We intend to implement word of mouth advertising into our business model. We believe a huge marketing opportunity on the internet is spreading word of mouth, a form of free advertising.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Moveix ’s Position in the Industry
 
Our major, notable competitors will be: Airboard, Cyboard, Esway, Future Foot, Hovertrax.
 
We are hoping to implement some new features on our products to be competitive with those companies. Our product prices will be within our competitors price range. Our disadvantage will be brand recognition and we hope to use different marketing strategy to make our brand recognized.
Outsourcing of Software Programmers.
 
Moveix Inc. plans to hire independent sub-contractors (programmers and web site developers) to customize the public domain software which is planned to be the foundation to our website and mobile application. We believe that these services may be obtained at competitive prices from software outsourcing companies operating in the United States; however we may encounter good programmers at competitive rates within the United States. At this time we have no arrangements with any vendors or third parties to obtain hardware or programming.

At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.
