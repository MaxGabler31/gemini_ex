Introduction 
 We are a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination (described below) with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants (described below), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents. 
 On June 9, 2014 and prior to our conversion from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation on January 3, 2017 (our Conversion), an affiliate of our sponsor (MIHI) purchased 100 of our common units for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. Prior to this initial investment, we had no assets, tangible or intangible. In conjunction with, and effective upon, the Conversion: (i) our name was changed from M Acquisition Company I LLC to Modern Media Acquisition Corp.; (ii) our 100 common units were converted into 100 shares of our common stock; and (iii) our 100 shares of common stock were contributed by MIHI to our sponsor. On February 15, 2017, we completed a 71,875 to one split of our common stock (the Stock Split). Our sponsor subsequently sold certain of such shares to certain of our officers and/or directors (such stockholders, including our sponsor, the initial stockholders) and separately surrendered 2,875,000 of its shares to us for no consideration. On May 11, 2017, we declared and paid to our stockholders a stock dividend of approximately 0.20475 shares for each share then held. As a result thereof, the total number of shares outstanding increased from 4,312,500 to 5,175,000 and the number of shares held by our sponsor increased from 4,212,500 to 5,075,000 (such outstanding shares prior to the completion of the IPO, the founder shares). All other stockholders surrendered to us for no consideration the shares received by them pursuant to the stock dividend. 
 On May 17, 2017, we consummated our IPO of 20,700,000 units (units and, with respect to the common stock included in the units offered, the public shares) of the Company, which included the underwriters full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit had an initial public offering price of $10.00 and consisted of one share of our common stock, one right and one-half of one warrant (each, a public warrant). Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination, as described in more detail in the final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on the IPO Closing Date (the Prospectus). Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments, and only whole warrants are exercisable. Gross proceeds to us from the IPO totaled $207,000,000.

 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,320,000 warrants (each, a private placement warrant) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of our common stock at $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
 IPO transaction costs amounted to $12,309,271, consisting of $3,600,000 of underwriting fees, $7,785,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (referred to as deferred underwriting commissions) (which are held in the trust account (defined below)) and $924,271 of IPO costs. 
 Following the closing of the IPO, $209,070,000 ($10.10 per unit) of the net proceeds from the sale of the units and the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account (the trust account) and has been invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in an open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, and will remain in the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below. 
 On January 24, 2019, we announced that we had entered into a Business Transaction Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2019 (the Business Transaction Agreement, with the transactions contemplated therein referred to as the Transactions), with Akazoo Limited, a private company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Scotland (Akazoo), Apostolos N. Zervos, acting in accordance with article 100-17 of the Luxembourg Company Act, on behalf and in the name of Unlimited Music S.A., a Luxembourg public limited company (société anonyme), and Modern Media LLC, a Georgia limited liability company acting in accordance with article 100-17 of the Luxembourg Company Act, on behalf and in the name of Modern Media Acquisition Corp. S.A., a Luxembourg public limited company (société anonyme) (PubCo). Pursuant to the Business Transaction Agreement, the Company and Akazoo agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement, to effect a combination of their respective businesses (the Akazoo Business Combination). The Transactions are described in more detail under Potential Business Combination with Akazoo Limited below. 
 In connection with our February 2019 stockholder vote to extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination from February 17, 2019 to June 17, 2019 (the Initial Extension), public stockholders had the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. In connection with the Initial Extension, a total of 5,942,681 public shares were redeemed for a total amount of approximately $61 million. Following the completion of such redemptions, we had approximately $152 million in cash remaining in the trust account and 14,757,319 public shares issued and outstanding. 
 In connection with the Initial Extension, the sponsor agreed to contribute to the Company as a loan $0.0333 for each share of the Companys common stock issued in the IPO (each, a Public Share) that was not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Initial Extension for each month (commencing on February 17, 2019 and on the 17th day of each subsequent calendar month), or portion thereof (on a prorated basis), that is needed by the Company to complete a business combination from February 17, 2019 until June 17, 2019 (the Contribution). Each Contribution will be deposited in the trust account on or before the 27th day of each calendar month. The amount of the Contributions will not bear interest and will be repayable by the Company to the sponsor upon consummation of the Companys initial business combination in cash; provided, however, that the sponsor may, at its option, convert each $1.00 outstanding of the Contribution into one warrant to purchase a share of common stock of the Company on the same terms and conditions as the warrants issued by the Company to the Sponsor in connection with the IPO. For the period through June 17, 2019, the sponsors aggregate Contributions are approximately $1.97 million, and consequently the redemption amount per Public Share as of June 17, 2019 was approximately $10.49 per Public Share. The sponsor does not intend to make any additional Contribution for any period after June 17, 2019. 
 In June 2019, we held a stockholder vote to further extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination from June 17, 2019 to September 17, 2019 (the Second Extension). In connection with the Second Extension, public stockholders had another opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. In connection with the Second Extension, holders of a total of 13,350,654 public shares elected to exercise their redemption rights. Upon the completion of such redemptions, we expect to have approximately $14.7 million in cash remaining in the trust account and 6,581,665 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company intends to obtain additional capital to supplement the amounts that will be available in the trust account from one or more financing arrangements that would be entered into concurrently with completion of the Akazoo Business Combination. 
 The holders of our units may elect to separately trade the common stock, rights and warrants comprising the units on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols MMDM, MMDMR and MMDMW, respectively. Those units not separated will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MMDMU. 
 Overview 
 We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience and contacts of our management team and our partnership with Macquarie Capital to complete our initial business combination. We believe our management teams distinctive background and record of acquisition and operational success could have a transformative impact on verified target businesses. Although we may pursue our initial business combination in any business, industry or geographic location, we currently intend to focus on opportunities to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business in the media, entertainment or marketing services industries. We intend to evaluate both private and public companies as potential initial business combination targets, focusing on opportunities that we believe would provide appropriate risk adjusted returns to stockholders. Following our initial business combination, our objective will be to implement or support the acquired companys operating strategies in order to generate additional value for stockholders. General goals may include additional acquisitions and operational improvements. 
 Organizations in a number of industries are undergoing rapid transformation resulting from what we believe will be the eventual convergence of traditional media and digital media into a singular media ecosystem (the new modern media ecosystem). This new modern media ecosystem is expected to feature personalized and individually addressable content and advertising distributed over Internet Protocol (IP) across multiple platforms and screens with multiple revenue streams, including advertising, subscription and commerce. This transformation is being driven by changes in consumer behavior and technological developments that are impacting media consumption, distribution and monetization. We believe nearly every sector of the media, entertainment and marketing services industries will continue to face significant disruption to their legacy business models as they adapt to these technological shifts. We also believe that the accelerating shift to a new modern media ecosystem has created a significant opportunity for a new breed of media companies to provide innovative products and services, and provides opportunities for strategic combinations to accelerate growth and create competitive advantages. Although a number of new companies promising some of these products or services have been formed, we believe many lack the experience or strategic acumen necessary to scale and successfully operate, and navigate in the new competitive environment. We believe our management teams distinctive background and vast network of industry leaders will be able to provide us with a differentiated opportunity to source a target, validate a potential targets offerings, consummate a business combination with the target and help grow a large enterprise through organic growth and accretive, follow-on acquisitions. 
 We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive businesses within the media, entertainment and marketing services industries that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. Our objective is to consummate our initial business combination with such a business and enhance stockholder value by improving its operational performance. We believe we can achieve this objective by utilizing our management teams extensive experience in both consummating media industry transactions and operating media companies in combination with our management teams network of contacts in the Telecom, Media & Technology (TMT) sector. We believe many companies in the media industry could benefit from access to the public markets but have been unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the time it takes to conduct a traditional initial public offering, market volatility and pricing uncertainty. We intend to focus on evaluating more established companies with leading competitive positions, strong management teams and strong long-term potential for revenue growth and margin expansion. 
 Our President, CEO and Chairman, Lewis W. Dickey, Jr., is the former Chairman, President and CEO of Cumulus Media Inc. (Cumulus). Cumulus is the countrys second largest radio company, owning and operating 445 stations in 90 markets and the WestwoodOne radio network. Mr. Dickey co-founded Cumulus in 1997, and in 2000 became its Chairman and CEO. During his 19 years at Cumulus, Mr. Dickey built the company through over 150 separate transactions, growing the company from a startup to more than $1.2 billion in annual revenue and 6,500 employees. 
 Mr. Dickey is also co-founder and chairman of DM Luxury, LLC (DM) which acquired Modern Luxury Media (Modern Luxury), a publisher of luxury lifestyle magazines, in 2010, out of receivership, for $25 million, approximately three years after it was sold for $250 million. At the time of DMs purchase, Modern Luxury had annual losses of approximately $5 million and cash revenue of approximately 
 
2 


  $41 million. Over the last seven years, DM has increased its cash revenue, becoming profitable, and we believe it is now the countrys largest regional magazine company with 67 magazines in 19 luxury markets, and it continues to expand as a premier local brand activation platform for the luxury market. Mr. Dickeys partner in DM is an affiliate of Macquarie, which, as described below, is an affiliate of our sponsor. 
 In 1993, Mr. Dickey and his family bought two radio stations in Atlanta out of bankruptcy for $6.8 million. Mr. Dickey changed the programming formats of the stations, completely re-staffed them and effected a dramatic turnaround. In 2000, the Dickey family sold one of the two stations to Cox Communications for $285 millionwhich remains one of the highest prices ever paid for a single radio station. The family still owns and operates the remaining station under the brand name 680 The Fan, which is one of the countrys most popular pure sports talk radio stations. 
 Mr. Dickey is also the author of two books on media: The New Modern Media was released in the fall of 2016 and serves as an investment thesis for the rapidly evolving modern media ecosystem, and a strategic roadmap for the future of the media and advertising business; Mr. Dickeys first book, which he wrote prior to starting Cumulus, is The FranchiseBuilding Radio Brands, which has been recognized as a definitive text on radio competition and strategy. 
 Over the course of their careers, Mr. Dickey and the other members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and relationships that have provided our management team with leads and referrals that have resulted in numerous acquisitions. We believe this history, and the contacts and relationships derived therefrom, will serve as a useful source for identifying potential future investment opportunities, including our initial business combination and otherwise. We believe our management team is well positioned to create value for our stockholders, and that our contacts and relationships, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers will allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. 
 In addition to the strength of our management team, we believe our partnership with Macquarie Capital, described below, further enhances our capabilities to source, execute and scrutinize potential acquisition targets. We believe potential target companies will view the track record of Macquarie Capital with respect to deal sourcing, financing and execution capabilities, as a further positive attribute contributing to our ability to structure and complete a successful initial business combination. 
 Our sponsor is 50% owned by MIHI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie and a part of Macquarie Capital. Macquarie is a global provider of financial, advisory, investment and funds management services. Macquaries main business focus is generating returns to investors and stockholders by providing a diversified range of services to clients. Macquarie acts on behalf of institutional, corporate and retail clients and counterparties around the world. Founded in 1969, Macquarie operates in 25 countries, employs approximately 14,470 people and has assets under management of over $380 billion (as of March 31, 2018). 
 Macquarie Capital comprises Macquaries advisory, capital raising and principal investing capabilities. The firm provides varied services to corporate, financial sponsor and government clients involved in mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity fund raising, corporate restructuring, project finance and public private partnerships. In the U.S., Macquarie Capital has specialist sector expertise and a comprehensive advisory and capital markets platform. 
 Macquarie Capital has a global TMT practice with over 50 dedicated professionals and a presence in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Macquaries TMT team has extensive history and credentials in the media and telecommunications sectors, making it a trusted advisor to media and telecommunications companies and investors. Since 2011, the U.S. TMT team has participated in over 115 transactions with a cumulative value of more than $37 billion. 
 MIHI has served as co-sponsor of two previous blank check companies that completed successful business combinations. MIHI served as co-sponsor of Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (Terrapin 3). Terrapin 3 raised gross proceeds of $213 million in its initial public offering in July 2014. In December 2016, Terrapin 3 completed a business combination with Yatra Online, Inc. (Yatra), a leading Indian online travel agency and travel search engine. Yatra trades on NASDAQ under the symbol YTRA. 
 MIHI also served as co-sponsor of Hydra Industries Acquisition Corp. Hydra Industries Acquisition Corp. raised gross proceeds of $80 million in its initial public offering in October 2014. In December 2016, Hydra Industries Acquisition Corp. completed an acquisition of Inspired Gaming Group (Inspired), a global games technology company supplying Virtual Sports, Mobile Gaming and server-based gaming systems with associated terminals and digital content to regulated betting and gaming operators around the world. Inspired trades on NASDAQ under the symbol INSE. 
 The past performance of the members of our management team, Macquarie or any of its affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management, Macquarie or any of its affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance. Only one of our directors has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our management teams operational expertise. Our selection process is expected to leverage our management teams broad and deep relationship network, unique media industry expertise including proven deal-sourcing and structuring capabilities, to provide us with a multitude of business combination opportunities. Our management team has experience:

 Since the completion of our IPO, we have communicated with our management teams and Macquarie Capitals network of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a potential target initial business combination and pursued and reviewed potential opportunities. As described herein, we are party to the Business Transaction Agreement and currently anticipate completing the transactions on or prior to September 17, 2019. 
 Business Combination Criteria 
 Consistent with our strategy, we identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses and, in evaluating prospective target businesses, we conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We are using, and expect to continue to use, these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria or guidelines. 

 | Focus on media, entertainment and marketing services companies positioned to compete in the new modern media ecosystem. We believe nearly every sector of the media, entertainment and marketing services industries will continue to face significant disruption to their legacy business models as they adapt to technological shifts. We are seeking a target that we believe will be positioned to compete in this new paradigm, whether the company is a traditional media company undergoing changes or a company deploying new technologies in the entertainment space, especially as digital and traditional media ecosystems continue to converge. We believe our strategy leverages our management teams distinctive background and vast network of industry leaders in the target sectors as well as Macquarie Capitals relationships and expertise in the broader TMT space.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Emphasis on companies that can benefit from a public listing and greater access to capital. We are seeking a target that we believe will benefit from being publicly traded and will be able to effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. In addition, we believe the accelerating shift to the new modern media ecosystem has created a significant opportunity for a new breed of media companies to provide innovative products and services. As such, we believe many companies in the new modern media ecosystem can benefit from increased access to capital.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Businesses with a catalyst for significantly improved financial performance. We are targeting companies where we believe that our industry expertise and relationships can be used to create opportunities for value creation, whether for acquisitions, capital investments in organic growth opportunities or in generating greater operating efficiencies. We are seeking to identify such opportunities for value creation in evaluating potential business combinations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Market-leading participant with experienced and motivated management teams that may benefit from enhanced leadership and governance. We are seeking a target that has an established business and market position. While we intend to focus on technology-enabled businesses, we do not intend to seek a target that is pre-revenue or in early stages of development with unproven technologies. Additionally, we are seeking a target with an established management team. To the extent we believe it will enhance stockholder value, we would selectively supplement the existing leadership of the business with proven leaders from our network, whether at the senior management level or at the board level.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Middle-market businesses. We are seeking a target with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $1.5 billion, determined according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe targeting companies in the middle market will provide the greatest number of opportunities for investment and will maximize the collective network of our management team and Macquarie Capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

 Initial Business Combination 
 The rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (NASDAQ) require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets and liabilities of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets and liabilities of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for the post transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQs 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team, our sponsor and their affiliates directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a potential business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will be required to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under law, and only present the opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our Charter) provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any of our officers and directors unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 
 Macquarie and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including principal investing, specialized investment vehicle management, asset management, financial advisory, securities underwriting, sales and trading, investment research, lending and other activities. In the ordinary course of business, they engage in activities where their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with our interests. Accordingly, there may be situations in which Macquarie or an affiliate has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. You should assume that these conflicts will not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our relationship with Macquarie. 
 Macquarie, its affiliates and their clients make investments in a variety of different businesses and may directly compete with us for acquisition opportunities provided or created by Macquarie or its affiliates that meet our initial business combination objectives. Neither Macquarie nor any of its affiliates has an obligation to offer potential acquisition opportunities to us and may allocate them at its discretion to us or other parties. We will not have any priority in respect of acquisition opportunities provided or created by Macquarie or its affiliates. You should assume that Macquarie and its affiliates and clients will have priority over us in terms of access to acquisition opportunities and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our relationship with Macquarie.

 Clients of Macquarie and its affiliates may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our initial business combination objectives. If Macquarie or any of its affiliates is engaged to act for any such clients, we may be precluded from pursuing opportunities that would conflict with Macquaries or its affiliates obligations to such client. In addition, investment ideas generated within Macquarie or its affiliates may be suitable for our company or a client of Macquarie or its affiliates, and may be directed to any of such persons or entities rather than to us. Macquarie or its affiliates may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company, business or assets that would qualify as an acquisition opportunity for us. In such cases, we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the company, business or assets. If, however, we are permitted to pursue the opportunity, the interests of Macquarie or its affiliates, or their obligations to the seller, may diverge from our interests. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019. Neither Macquarie nor any of its affiliates (other than our sponsor) has entered into such an agreement, and, accordingly, are not precluded from participating in any other blank check company or from underwriting an offering by any other blank check company. 
 Proposed Business Combination with Akazoo Limited 
 On January 24, 2019, we entered into the Business Transaction Agreement, pursuant to which we intend to complete the Akazoo Business Combination. The Akazoo Business Combination will be effected as follows: (i) in accordance with Luxembourg law and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), the Company will merge with and into PubCo, with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the Merger); (ii) no later than seven days prior to the effective date of the Merger, LuxCo will acquire the entire issued share capital of Akazoo by issuing LuxCo shares (LuxCo Shares) to the Akazoo shareholders (the Share Exchange), such that the shareholdings of LuxCo will be identical to that of Akazoo prior to the Share Exchange; and (iii) on the calendar day following the effective date of the Merger, LuxCo will merge with and into PubCo in accordance with Luxembourg law, with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the Luxembourg Merger). Following the consummation of the Luxembourg Merger, Akazoo will be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, and the current security holders of the Company and Akazoo will be shareholders of PubCo. 
 The PubCo ordinary shares are expected to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) following consummation of the Business Combination. It is expected that the existing shareholders of Akazoo will own a majority of the PubCo ordinary shares following the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 Subject to the terms of the Business Transaction Agreement and at the consummation of the Merger, each share of the Companys common stock will convert into the right to receive one PubCo ordinary share, and each warrant to purchase the Companys common stock (each, a Company Warrant) will convert into a warrant to purchase an equal number of PubCo ordinary shares (each, a PubCo Warrant) on the same terms as the Company warrants. Also, as a result of the transactions, the holders of the Companys currently outstanding rights to purchase the Companys common stock will receive, with respect to each right, 0.1 PubCo ordinary shares. 
 Existing Akazoo shareholders will receive an aggregate number of PubCo ordinary shares equal to an assumed Akazoo enterprise value of $380 million (less any cash payment to them) divided by the per share redemption price applicable to any redemptions by public stockholders of the Company. The existing Akazoo shareholders prior to the Luxembourg Merger will receive a cash distribution of up to $20 million, in exchange for a portion of their shares, if and to the extent that cash available in the Companys trust account, after the payment of transaction fees and expenses and any redemptions, exceeds $110 million. 
 Additionally, subject to the terms of the Business Transaction Agreement, as consideration for the cancellation of their LuxCo shares (LuxCo Shares) in exchange for PubCo ordinary shares in the Luxembourg Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding LuxCo Share will be cancelled, and (ii) each LuxCo shareholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of the Share Consideration. Also, each LuxCo shareholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of the Cash Payment (if any) as a compensatory payment under Luxembourg law to be payable 10 calendar days after the closing date of the Luxembourg Merger. 
 For purposes of this section, each of the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below: 
 Akazoo Enterprise Value means $380,000,000, less the Cash Payment (if any); 
 Aggregate Redemption Payment means an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the product of the Per Share Redemption Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are redeemed pursuant to the Company Common Stockholder Redemption; 
 Company Common Stockholder Redemption means the right held by certain stockholders of the Company to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Company Common Stock upon the consummation of a business combination, for a per share redemption price of cash equal to (a) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Companys trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay certain taxes, divided by (b) the number of then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock issued in connection with the Companys initial public offering. 
 Cash Payment means an aggregate amount in U.S. dollars equal to the lesser of the Trust Amount Available for Cash Payment and $20,000,000; 
 Per Share Redemption Amount means an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the quotient of (A) the trust amount held in the Companys trust account two business days prior to the consummation of the Merger, divided by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are held by all Company stockholders other than shares held by certain Company sponsors (and not including any shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable pursuant to any Company Right); 
 Share Consideration means a number of PubCo ordinary shares equal to the quotient of (A) the sum of the Akazoo Enterprise Value, divided by (B) the Per Share Redemption Amount; 
 Stamp Duty Amount means the aggregate stamp duty (if any) payable with respect to the Share Exchange or the Luxembourg Merger; and 
 Trust Amount Available for Cash Payment means (A) the trust amount held in the Companys trust account two business days prior to the consummation of the Merger; less (B) the Aggregate Redemption Payment; less (C) an amount equal to any and all transaction fees and expenses incurred by the Company, PubCo, LuxCo and Akazoo in connection with the Transactions, up to a maximum of $18,000,000; less (D) the Stamp Duty Amount; less (E) $110,000,000; or if such number results in a negative number, $0. 
 The Business Transaction Agreement provides for customary conditions precedent to closing, including (i) approval by the Companys stockholders of (A) the adoption of the Business Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL, and (B) any other proposals the parties deem necessary or desirable to consummate the Akazoo Business Combination (collectively, the Transaction Proposals), in accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, the Companys organizational documents and the DGCL, (ii) approval of the Transactions by the Akazoo shareholders in accordance with the laws of Scotland and Akazoos organizational documents, (iii) a registration statement on Form F-4 (or other appropriate form) pursuant to which the PubCo ordinary shares, PubCo Warrants and the PubCo ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of such PubCo Warrants to be issued to the holders of Company Warrants pursuant to the Merger shall be registered for issuance under the Securities Act, having been declared effective by the SEC; (iv) the issuance of all necessary permits and authorizations under state securities or blue sky laws; (v) the funds contained in the Companys Trust Account and any additional capital otherwise available to the Company being not less than $60,000,000; (vi) the PubCo ordinary shares having been approved for listing on Nasdaq and (vii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. 
 The Business Transaction Agreement may be terminated at any time at or prior to the consummation of the Business Combination by mutual consent of the Company and Akazoo. In addition, the Business Transaction Agreement may be terminated: 
 

 | by either the Company or Akazoo if (i) consummation of the Business Combination has not occurred on or prior to June 30, 2019 (the Outside Date) for any reason other than delay and/or nonperformance of the party seeking such termination; (ii) the conditions set forth in the Business Transaction Agreement cannot be satisfied prior to the Outside Date; (iii) the Business Combination Agreement fails to receive approval from the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting; or (iv) the consummation of any of the Transactions is permanently enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable order of a court, unless the terminating partys willful breach is the primary reason for such injunction or prohibition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | by the Company, if (i) Company stockholders do not approve a proposal to extend the time in which the Company must complete its initial business combination (the Extension), (ii) Akazoo is in breach of the Business Transaction Agreement, and such breach is incapable of being cured or is not cured within 20 days of written notice to the Company or (iii) there occurs disclosure of any event, fact, or circumstance that is reasonably likely to cause the failure of any condition in the Business Transaction Agreement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | by Akazoo, if (i) the Company is in breach of the Business Transaction Agreement, and such breach is incapable of being cured or is not cured within 20 days of written notice to the Company; (ii) the Company ceases to be listed on Nasdaq, or PubCos initial listing application in connection with the Business Combination is not approved by Nasdaq by June 30, 2019; or (iii) (A) the Company board of directors shall have failed to recommend to its stockholders that they vote in favor of the adoption of the Transaction Proposals or failed to include the Company board recommendation in the proxy statement for the Stockholders Meeting or (B) there has been a change in recommendation, as defined in the Business Transaction Agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pursuant to the Business Transaction Agreement, Akazoo and its representatives waive all rights or claims to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by the Company, including for a breach of the Business Transaction Agreement or any agreements or understandings with the Company, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account except as expressly contemplated by the Business Transaction Agreement. However, (i) nothing contained in the Business Transaction Agreement will limit or prohibit Akazoos right to pursue a claim against the Company for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust Account, and (ii) nothing contained in the Business Transaction Agreement will serve to limit or prohibit any claims that Akazoo may have in the future against the Companys assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds). 
 Concurrent with the execution of the Business Transaction Agreement, the Company, Akazoo and certain shareholders representing a majority of Akazoos existing voting shares entered into separate Voting Agreements (the Voting Agreements). Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, the shareholders party thereto agreed to (i) vote their shares in favor of the Transactions, against any other transaction and against actions that would have the effect of delaying or inhibiting the timely consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) take any other actions set forth in the transaction step plan contemplated by the Business Transaction Agreement, including exercising their drag-along rights in furtherance of the Share Exchange. Additionally, the shareholder parties made certain customary representations and warranties with respect to the shares of Akazoo and LuxCo owned by such shareholder. 
 In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Transaction Agreement, PubCo and its majority shareholders will enter into a Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) to set forth certain agreements regarding the relationships among themselves and the governance of PubCo. 
 The initial PubCo board of directors (the PubCo Board) will be composed of up to seven directors, with one individual designated by the investor shareholders (Tosca Penta Music Limited Partnership and InternetQ Group Limited), who need not be independent, one individual designated by the Company shareholders (either Modern Media Sponsor, LLC, or if such entity is dissolved prior to the closing, MIHI LLC and Modern Media LLC), and one individual designated by certain management shareholders (including Mr. Zervos), each of whom need not be independent, as described in the Shareholders Agreement. For a period of three years following entry into the Shareholders Agreement, Lewis W. Dickey, Jr. will be the non-executive Chairman of the PubCo Board and a member of the PubCo Board. Mr. Zervos will be the initial Chief Executive Officer and an initial member of the PubCo Board. At all times during the term of the Shareholders Agreement, the shareholder parties will cause the majority of the PubCo Board to be comprised of independent directors. 
 The Company and Akazoo continue to work toward satisfaction of the conditions to closing the Akazoo Business Combination and the related Transactions, and while management of the Company currently anticipates that the Transactions will be completed prior to the Second Extension, there can be no assurances that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived, or that the Transactions will be completed on the terms or the timing currently anticipated, or at all. 
 Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets 
 We believe our management teams significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies has provided us with a substantial number of potential initial business combination opportunities. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and exiting investments and properties, our management teams relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
 This network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context, other than as provided below in Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination. 
 As more fully described elsewhere herein, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently and in the future may have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to various entities that may present a conflict of interest. As a result of these duties and obligations, situations may arise in which business opportunities may be given to one or more of these other entities prior to being presented to us. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our status as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we will be able to offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective process to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay the offering or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

 Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We anticipate that additional potential target initial business combination candidates will be brought to our attention from our officers, directors, and sponsor, as well as various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Potential initial business combination targets may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to potential initial business combination targets in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus relating to the IPO and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Macquarie Capital is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a potential initial business combination. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. 
 In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which the post transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for the post transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment 
 
7 


  Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 We have granted Macquarie Capital, an affiliate of our sponsor, a right of first refusal for a period of 36 months from the IPO Closing Date to provide to us certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which it may receive fees. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. 
 Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 

 | subject us to numerous, and possibly negative, economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevent us from benefitting from the possible spreading of risks or off-setting of losses; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team; Existing and Future Management 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary knowledge, skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our officers or directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is highly unlikely that any of our officers will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite knowledge, skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction | Whether StockholderApproval is Required
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company | No 
Merger of the Company with a target | Yes 

 Under NASDAQs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | we would issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market prior to the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares, rights or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information; and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it may be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
 In the event that our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of such purchases may be to: (i) vote such public shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination; (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met; or (iii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it more difficult to maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our furnishing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only 
 
9 


  potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our proposed initial business combination. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our sponsor or its affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account as of March 31, 2019 was approximately $10.13 per public share. The redemption amount per public share described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is as of March 31, 2019, except where otherwise noted. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our other directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial stockholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our Charter would typically require stockholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law and stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. 
 If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our Charter: 
 

 | conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of capital stock representing a majority of all of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares held by our initial stockholders, directors and officers will count towards this quorum. Our initial stockholders have agreed to vote all of their founder shares and any public shares purchased in favor of our initial business combination. Our other directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of our initial business combination with respect to any public shares acquired by them. These voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will complete our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed initial business combination or vote at all. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire in connection with the completion of a business combination. Our other directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial stockholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them. 
 Our Charter provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, any proposed agreement relating to our initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to 
 
10 


  be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we would not be able to complete the business combination or redeem any such shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption would be returned to the holders thereof. 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our Charter: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct a redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, our Charter provides that if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe the restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holders shares were not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management team at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of such stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date to be set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials we will furnish to such holders, or, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we furnish our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 
11 


 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date to be set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. 
 Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we would promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If any proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete our initial business combination with a different target until September 17, 2019. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have until September 17, 2019 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by September 17, 2019, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, and subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish our public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019. 
 Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019. However, if our initial stockholders or other members of our management team acquire public shares now or in the future, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019. 
 The underwriters in our IPO have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019 and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our shares of common stock. 
 Our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Charter that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial stockholders, directors or officers, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restrictions.

 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 Based on the amounts on deposit in the trust account as of March 31, 2019, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the redemption amount per outstanding share received by public stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.13. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.13. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although have sought and we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our executive officers will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if our executive officers believe that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our executive officers to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where executive officers are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. 
 Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (i) $10.13 per public share; or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below: (i) $10.13 per public share; or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.13 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by September 17, 2019 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision 
 
13 


  for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following September 17, 2019 in the event that we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by September 17, 2019, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by September 17, 2019, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, and subject to having lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest income earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish our public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.13 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 17, 2019 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholders voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 
 Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our Charter contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our Charter relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they currently have or may acquire in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our other directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial stockholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them. Specifically, our Charter provides, among other things, that: 
 
14 


 
 | prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we will either: (i) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable); or (ii) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we will complete our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such completion;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if our initial business combination is not completed by September 17, 2019, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional common stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These provisions may not be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our Charter provides that we may complete our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding rights and warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Conflicts of Interest 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will be required to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under law, and only present the opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our Charter provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any of our officers and directors unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 
 Macquarie and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including principal investing, specialized investment vehicle management, asset management, financial advisory, securities underwriting, sales and trading, investment research, lending and other activities. In the ordinary course of business, they engage in activities where their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with our interests. Accordingly, there may be situations in which Macquarie or an affiliate has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. You should assume that these conflicts will not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our relationship with Macquarie. 
 Macquarie, its affiliates and their clients make investments in a variety of different businesses and may directly compete with us for acquisition opportunities provided or created by Macquarie or its affiliates that meet our initial business combination objectives. Neither Macquarie nor any of its affiliates has an obligation to offer potential acquisition opportunities to us and may allocate them at its discretion to us or other parties. We will not have any priority in respect of acquisition opportunities provided or created by Macquarie or its affiliates. You should assume that Macquarie and its affiliates and clients will have priority over us in terms of access to acquisition opportunities and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our relationship with Macquarie. 
 Clients of Macquarie and its affiliates may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our initial business combination objectives. If Macquarie or any of its affiliates is engaged to act for any such clients, we may be precluded from pursuing opportunities that would conflict with Macquaries or its affiliates obligations to such client. In addition, investment ideas generated within Macquarie or its affiliates may be suitable for our company or a client of Macquarie or its affiliates, and may be directed to any of such persons or entities rather than to us. 
 
15 


  Macquarie or its affiliates may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company, business or assets that would qualify as an acquisition opportunity for us. In such cases, we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the company, business or assets. If, however, we are permitted to pursue the opportunity, the interests of Macquarie or its affiliates, or their obligations to the seller, may diverge from our interests. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination September 17, 2019. Neither Macquarie nor any of its affiliates (other than the sponsor) has entered into such an agreement and, accordingly, are not precluded from participating in any other blank check company or from underwriting an offering by any other blank check company. 
 Indemnity 
 Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (i) $10.13 per public share; or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for its indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 
Employees 
 We currently have three officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, common stock, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. You may obtain information from the SEC-maintained web site (http://www.sec.gov), which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The contents of this website are not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this filing. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by an independent registered public accounting firm. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential target businesses, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and

  exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the IPO Closing Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior September 30th; and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
