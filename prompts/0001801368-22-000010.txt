ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
MP Materials Corp. is the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere. The Company owns and operates the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility (“Mountain Pass”), the only rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America. We estimate the rare earth concentrate we produced and sold in 2021 represented approximately 15% of the rare earth content consumed in the global market. Separated rare earth elements (“REE”) are critical inputs for the magnets that enable the mobility of electric vehicles (“EVs”), drones, defense systems, wind turbines, robotics and many other high-growth, advanced technologies. Our integrated operations at Mountain Pass combine low production costs with high environmental standards, thereby restoring American leadership to a critical industry with a strong commitment to sustainability.
We currently produce a rare earth concentrate that we sell pursuant to the A&R Offtake Agreement (as defined in Note 4, “Relationship and Agreements with Shenghe,” in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) to Shenghe Resources (Singapore) International Trading Pte. Ltd. (“Shenghe”), an affiliate of Shenghe Resources Holding Co., Ltd., a leading global rare earth company that is publicly listed in China, that, in turn, typically sells that product to refiners in China. These refiners separate the constituent REE contained in our concentrate and sell the separated products to their customers. Upon completion of our Stage II optimization project (“Stage II”), we anticipate producing separated rare earth oxides (“REO”), including neodymium-praseodymium (“NdPr”) oxide, and selling these products directly to end users, at which time we may no longer sell our concentrate. Stage II is discussed further in the “Our Process” section below.
In December 2021, we announced (i) that we will build our initial rare earth, metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas (the “Fort Worth Facility”), and (ii) that we entered into a long-term agreement with General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) (“GM”) to supply U.S.-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors in more than a dozen models using GM’s Ultium Platform, with a gradual production ramp that begins in 2023. These developments are a part of our Stage III downstream expansion strategy (“Stage III”), which is discussed further in the “Our Process” section below.
As electrification drives significant global growth in demand for REE, we believe global economic trends, geopolitical realities and sustainability mandates are coalescing to further our opportunity to create shareholder value. We believe businesses are increasingly prioritizing diversification and security of their global supply chains so as to reduce reliance on a single producer or region for critical materials. As the only scaled source in North America for critical rare earths, with a processing facility designed to operate with best-in-class sustainability and a competitive cost structure, we believe we are well-positioned to thrive in this transforming global economy.
Our mission is to maximize shareholder returns over the long-term by executing a disciplined business strategy to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States of America. We believe we can generate positive outcomes for U.S. national security and industry, the U.S. workforce, and the environment.
Rare Earth Industry Overview
Rare earth elements are fundamental building blocks of the modern economy, impacting trillions of dollars in global gross domestic product through the enablement of end products across industries including transportation, clean energy, robotics, national defense, and consumer electronics, among others. By economic value, NdPr is the largest segment of the REE market. NdPr is most often utilized in NdPr magnets, which are also commonly referred to as “neo,” “NdFeB,” “NIB,” or permanent magnets, and are made predominantly from an alloy of NdPr, iron and boron. NdFeB magnets are the most widely used type of rare earth magnets and are critical for many advanced technologies that are experiencing strong secular growth, including EVs, drones, defense systems, wind turbines, robotics and many others. The rapid growth of these and other advanced motion technologies is expected to drive substantial demand growth for NdPr and NdFeB magnets.
The REE group includes 17 elements, primarily the 15 lanthanide elements. Lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium are considered “light REE” that are predominant in bastnaesite; samarium, europium and gadolinium are often referred to as “medium REE”; while terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium are considered “heavy REE.” Two additional elements, yttrium and scandium, are often classified as heavy REE although they are not lanthanides. Depending upon the rare earth-bearing mineral, the mixture of light, medium and heavy REE will differ.
The aggregate global market for REO totaled approximately 180,000 metric tons in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 4% through 2030, according to research by the CRU Group (“CRU”). Further, CRU estimates that the NdPr segment of the REO market, which makes up the significant majority of the market value, is expected to grow at a 9.1% CAGR through 2030 (excluding the impact of closed loop recycling), well in excess of the overall REO market. This expected growth will be driven by secular growth in demand for NdPr magnets.
REO are used in a diverse array of end markets, including:
•Clean-Energy and Transportation Technologies: traction motors in EVs and hybrid electric vehicles, generators in wind power turbines, and linear motors in mag-lev trains;
•High-Technology Applications: miniaturization of smart phones and other mobile devices, computing devices, speakers and microphones, as well as fiber optics, lasers, robotics, medical devices and optical temperature sensors in medical and industrial environments;
•Critical Defense Applications: guidance and control systems, communications, global positioning systems, radar and sonar, drones, and railguns; and
•Essential Industrial Infrastructure: advanced catalyst applications in oil refining, pollution-control systems in traditional internal-combustion automobiles, glass polishing, and LED lighting and phosphors.
Our Process
Upon completion of Stage II, processing at Mountain Pass will include five primary process steps: (i) mining and crushing; (ii) milling and flotation; (iii) leaching and impurity removal; (iv) separation and extraction; and (v) product finishing. Having completed Stage I of our optimization plan (“Stage I”) (discussed below), we are engaged in the first two of these steps. The first step includes mining the primarily bastnaesite ore followed by comminution, which involves crushing and grinding the ore into a milled slurry. In the second step, the milled bastnaesite slurry is then processed by froth flotation, whereby the bastnaesite floats to the surface while the gangue, or non-desired, elements are suppressed and disposed as tailings. We believe we are unique among scaled rare earth producers in our use of a dry tailings process that allows recycling of the water used in our milling and flotation circuit and eliminates the need for high-risk wet tailings ponds and traditional impoundment dams. In 2021, dry tailings processes allowed us to recycle over 1.7 billion liters of water.
Stage I
Following the acquisition of Mountain Pass in July 2017, we began implementing Stage I, which was designed to re-establish stable, scaled production of rare earth concentrate, leveraging the existing processing facility. Since restarting operations from cold-idle status, we implemented changes in the milling, flotation and tailings management processes; implemented and continue to advance an improved reagent scheme to improve mineral recovery; and implemented operational best practices. Together, these changes materially increased plant uptime and reliability driving enhanced flotation throughput, REO recovery and production as well as tailings facility reliability and throughput at a significantly lower cost per processed ton. We have established our ability to achieve approximately 3.5x the production volume of REO content as the prior operator of Mountain Pass using the same capital equipment. We also believe that our Stage I efforts enabled us to achieve world-class production cost levels for rare earth concentrate.
Stage II
Stage II is focused on advancing our operations from the production of rare earth concentrate to the separation of individual REE. Engineering, procurement, construction, and other recommissioning activities are underway and involve upgrades and enhancements to the existing facility process flow to reliably produce separated REE at a lower cost and with an expected smaller environmental footprint per unit of REO produced. As part of Stage II, we are in the process of reintroducing an oxidizing roasting circuit, reorienting the plant process flow, increasing product finishing capacity, improving wastewater management, and making other improvements to materials handling and storage. The reintroduction of the oxidizing roasting circuit also allows subsequent stages of the production process to occur at lower temperatures, and with significantly lower volumes of materials and reagents, which supports lower operating and maintenance costs and higher uptime.
The roasting step that oxidizes the rare earth concentrate in a rotary kiln is crucial to ensuring the cost-competitiveness of Mountain Pass. One of the unique attributes of bastnaesite is the ability to convert the trivalent cerium in the mixed rare earth concentrate to tetravalent cerium that has a low propensity to dissolve, enabling cerium to be separated expediently along with other insoluble gangue elements without selective extraction. Removal of the lower-value cerium early in our separations process will allow for up to a 40% reduction in the mass of material to be separated and finished, thus dramatically reducing the 
energy, reagents, and wastewater required to produce the higher-value NdPr. Upon completion of Stage II, we expect to be a global low-cost, high-volume producer of NdPr oxide, which represents a majority of the value contained in our ore.
In February 2022, we were awarded a $35.0 million contract by the Department of Defense’s Office of Industrial Base Policy to design and build a facility to process heavy rare earth elements (“HREE”). Successful completion of this project will establish the first processing and separation facility of its kind for HREEs in support of commercial and defense applications in the United States. The HREE processing and separations facility will be built at Mountain Pass and tie in with the rest of our Stage II facilities.
Stage III
Our mission is to restore the full rare earth magnetics supply chain to the U.S. by pursuing opportunities to integrate further downstream into converting NdPr into metal, alloy, and permanent magnets, as well as advancing magnet recycling capabilities. We recently announced our Fort Worth Facility, which we expect will have the capacity to produce approximately 1,000 metric tons (“MTs”) of finished NdFeB magnets per year, sufficient to power approximately 500,000 EV motors annually. The NdFeB alloy and magnets produced will also support other key markets, including clean energy, electronic and defense technologies. We also expect to supply NdFeB alloy flake to other magnet producers to help develop a diverse and resilient U.S. magnet supply chain. The Fort Worth Facility will serve as the business and engineering headquarters for our growing magnetics division.
The integration of magnet production would establish us as the first and only fully-integrated source of supply for rare earth magnets in the Western Hemisphere. By offering magnet customers a complete, end-to-end Western supply chain solution, we believe vertical integration represents a material incremental value creation opportunity. We believe that the ability to capture significant value from magnet production requires a scaled, steady supply of NdPr, which we believe we are uniquely-positioned to provide in the Western Hemisphere. We also believe integration into magnet production will provide some protection from commodity pricing volatility, while also enhancing our business profile as the producer of a critical industrial output in addition to a producer of resources.
Our Strategy
Offer the Western Hemisphere a trusted, sustainable source of supply for materials and components that enable the development of critical industries.
More than 60 years of operations at Mountain Pass have demonstrated that our ore body is one of the world’s largest and highest-grade rare earth resources. The low-volume nature of rare earth mining coupled with the exceptional scale and quality of the ore body results in a resource with significant viability well into the future.
Upon the completion of Stage II, we believe Mountain Pass will be one of the largest, most advanced and efficient fully-integrated REO processing facilities in the world, and the only such facility located in the Western Hemisphere. We hope to reinvigorate the industrial history of the rare earths supply chain that originated in the United States and provide a domestic alternative to both current and future users of rare earths that helps them avoid the risks associated with the single point-of-failure currently represented by China in the global rare earth supply chain. In addition, the U.S. government is actively seeking to end the country’s reliance on foreign REE sources, and we believe that our constructive relationship with key regulators and the relative stability of U.S. policies provides us with an advantage relative to non-U.S. REE producers.
The global effort to curb carbon emissions and reverse climate change often focuses on the impact of the transportation system, and we believe that our products will play a significant role in advancing those efforts. To date, nearly all U.S. states and the District of Columbia have mandated or offer incentives to support deployment of EVs or alternative fuel vehicles and supporting infrastructure, either through state legislation or private utility incentives within the state, with similar mandates and incentives in other countries globally. The NdPr product that we intend to produce at Mountain Pass is essential to the permanent magnet motor technology deployed in the significant majority of current EVs. In addition, we believe end consumers will demand that the materials used to build these vehicles be extracted sustainably. We are committed to protecting biodiversity and our environmental management plans cover biodiversity impacts, waste and noise management, air and water pollution, as well as natural resource and toxic chemical usage. We believe that our commitment to environmentally responsible production of REO will be a strong competitive advantage in building relationships with EV manufacturers, who share our commitment to sustainability.
A confluence of geopolitical and economic factors is causing downstream customers, such as automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), to be increasingly focused on supply risk, highlighting the need to develop domestic production of REE and related products. To meet the growth in demand for EVs, we believe automotive OEMs will redesign 
their supply chains to ensure a ready and stable supply of rare earth products as they transition their engine, transmission and motor manufacturing facilities to build EV components. We aim to capitalize on and accelerate this opportunity by seeking to partner with current and future customers in their efforts to re-position the capital and labor in their supply chain and to meet the growth in electrification.
Leverage our low-cost position to maximize earnings power in all commodity price environments.
The success of our business reflects and will reflect our ability to manage our costs. Our production achievements in Stage I have provided economies of scale to lower production costs per unit of REO produced in concentrate. Stage II is designed to enable us to continue to manage our cost structure for separating REE through an optimized facility process flow. This process flow will allow us to use significantly less energy and raw materials per ton of separated REO.
Optimization of logistics is also central to maintaining a low-cost position relative to other global producers. The location of our facility, which is immediately adjacent to Interstate 15, within one hour of truck drive-time to a major railhead and four hours to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, offers significant transportation advantages that create meaningful cost efficiencies in securing incoming supplies and shipping our final products. We believe the self-contained nature of our operations—with mining, milling, separations, and finishing all on one site—creates additional cost advantages and operational risk mitigation and upon the completion of Stage II, our integrated site will no longer incur the packaging, handling and transportation costs incurred by competitors who lack co-located processing.
Further our mission and ability to capture the full rare earth value chain through downstream integration into NdFeB magnet production.
Beyond re-establishing a supply chain for REE in the Western Hemisphere, we expect to recognize compelling longer-term opportunities to further our mission through the capture of additional value by pairing our attractive access to a large domestic rare earth supply with growing industry demands for magnetic materials. We are currently pursuing vertical integration through further downstream processing of REO into rare earth metals, alloys and finished magnets, including recycling. We intend to achieve this through a buy, build and/or joint venture strategy to achieve technical and cost leadership. We recently announced an agreement with GM and are developing a greenfield metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing and recycling facility in Fort Worth, Texas. We intend to continue exploring future opportunities to invest in, develop, and/or sponsor new downstream opportunities for REO, rare earth metals and alloys and rare earth products that contribute to the electrification of the industrial economy.
We believe our successes to-date at Mountain Pass demonstrate a competency in identifying undervalued assets, creating a disciplined, execution-focused strategy, and assembling the management talent to create value. We intend to apply our experience and skill sets across the rare earth value chain, while allocating capital effectively and responsibly, toward opportunities demonstrated to be in the best interest of our stockholders and consistent with our mission.
Human Capital Resources
Our people are our most valuable asset in progressing toward and ultimately fulfilling the Company’s mission. We strive to develop and maintain an owner-operator culture that instills an entrepreneurial spirit where our employees feel empowered to deliver results through an unwavering commitment to doing what is right in a safe environment. Ensuring we attract, develop and retain top talent across all functions with diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives is critical to our success. In each calendar quarter of 2021, our employee retention rate was approximately 94% or higher, which we believe demonstrates that we have prioritized investments and communication to ensure our team is healthy, motivated, proud to work for us, and believes in the Company’s mission.
Workforce Composition and Benefits
Since relaunching production at Mountain Pass in July 2017, we have increased our full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employee base from eight contractors in 2017 to 365 employees as of December 31, 2021, of which 313 were field-based employees and 52 were office-based employees. This represents a 32% increase of FTE employees in 2021. None of the employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. As part of our mission, we are committed to creating employment opportunities for U.S. workers and expect to hire more than 150 additional full-time employees as part of Stage II and at least 100 full-time employees as part of Stage III, the majority of which will support the Fort Worth Facility.
In living up to the owner-operator culture that powers our mission, in 2021, we issued immediately vested equity grants to all then-active, non-executive employees for the second year in a row. We believe equity ownership in the Company reinforces an unwavering commitment to our workforce and enhances our employees’ sense of their contribution to the results of the 
Company. The equity awards were provided in addition to competitive wages, comprehensive benefits and discretionary bonuses and incentive compensation opportunities.
Health and Safety
The health, well-being and safety of our employees, suppliers and communities are a top priority. We are committed to maintaining a strong safety culture and to emphasizing the importance of our employees’ role in identifying, mitigating and communicating safety risks. We believe that the achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in managing our operations.
The Company has established appropriate COVID-19 protocols in accordance with laws, guidance and regulations to ensure the safety of all employees and visitors of our facilities. Based on feedback received from our corporate employees through a return-to-office survey, in June 2021, we implemented a temporary hybrid schedule for onsite and remote work for our corporate office. At Mountain Pass, we continued staggered shift times and breaks to support appropriate distancing protocols, provided personal protective equipment across our teams, and initiated an enhanced disinfection program, which included sanitizer, cleaning supplies and electrostatic sprayers, with a focus on shared locations and equipment. We also worked diligently with our employees to accommodate their requests to use the Families First Coronavirus Relief Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. To encourage COVID-19 vaccination participation, the Company administered an incentive program for successful completion of a vaccination regimen.
Through these efforts, as well as our continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices recommended by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control, we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our customers, while also managing the spread of the virus and promoting the health, well-being and safety of our employees, suppliers and communities.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce produces better overall decision-making for employees, which benefits the organization. In addition to the requisite skills, we have taken steps to assemble a diverse workforce. One example is partnering with local veterans’ organizations for collaboration on presenting career opportunities and demonstrating support from the Company. As of December 31, 2021, based on employees’ self-reporting, veterans and women represented 4% and 15%, respectively, of our workforce and 18% of managerial or supervisory positions were occupied by women. As we progress with our Stage II and Stage III projects, we will continue to strive to assemble a diverse and inclusive workforce.
Employee Engagement and Development
Employee engagement efforts are critical in ensuring all employees feel heard and valued, and that applicable actions are taken when feedback is received. We provide opportunities for employees to engage with executive management through events such as virtual town hall sessions, which are typically conducted twice per year. 
Methodical execution is key to ensuring our Company goals are achieved and exceeded. For 2021, we revamped our performance management evaluation process to align more closely with our mission. This revised performance management baseline, rooted in the values of our organization, will set the foundation for applicable goal-setting, individual development plans and career pathways going forward.
We are dedicated to the continual training and development of our employees, especially of those in field operations, to ensure we develop future managers and leaders from within our organization. Our training starts on an employee’s first day with on-boarding procedures that focus on safety, responsibility, ethical conduct and inclusive teamwork. In addition, we have an electrical and instrumentation apprenticeship program in which we pay for our employees to attend trade school to increase their opportunity for future advancement.
Customers
Currently, we sell the vast majority of our rare earth concentrate to Shenghe under the terms of the A&R Offtake Agreement. Shenghe is contractually obligated under the A&R Offtake Agreement to purchase all of our rare earth concentrate product meeting certain minimum specifications on a “take-or-pay basis” (such that they are obliged to pay for product even if they are unable or unwilling to take delivery). Shenghe sells the rare earth concentrate it acquires under the A&R Offtake Agreement to customers in China, which process and resell these refined products. The A&R Offtake Agreement will terminate by the end of the first quarter of 2022. In February 2022, we entered into a term sheet with Shenghe which provides that once our A&R Offtake Agreement expires, we will continue to sell and Shenghe will continue to purchase our rare earth concentrate 
under an offtake arrangement. We may also enter into short- and long-term sales contracts with new customers for the sale of our rare earth concentrate.
In addition, we intend to enter into short- and long-term sales contracts with existing and new customers for separated REO in anticipation of and upon the completion of Stage II. For certain REE where the market demand is high, we may decide not to enter into letters of intent or contracts prior to commencing production.
We are also pursuing sales opportunities for our future NdFeB alloy and magnet products. In December 2021, we entered into a long-term agreement with GM to supply rare earth alloy flake and finished magnets to GM for the electric motors in its Ultium Platform, which will be manufactured in our Fort Worth Facility. We are currently negotiating the terms of a definitive long-term supply agreement with GM, which will include all of the necessary terms and conditions.
Suppliers
We use certain proprietary chemical reagents in our flotation process, which we currently purchase from third-party suppliers. These products are subject to pricing volatility, supply availability and other restrictions and guidelines. In the event of a supply disruption or any other restriction, we believe that alternative reagents could be sourced. The solvent extraction and finishing processes are highly reliant upon standard commodity reagents, particularly hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure and licensing agreements, patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. We utilize trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rare earth technology.
Competition
The rare earth mining and processing markets are capital intensive and highly competitive. Outside of the six major rare earth producers in China (which are being consolidated into two rare earth conglomerates), and those consolidated under their production quotas—there are only two other producers operating at scale, our Company and Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., which processes its rare earth materials in Malaysia.
Environmental, Health, Safety and Regulatory Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws, certifications, regulations, permits, and other legal requirements applicable to the mining and mineral processing industry, including, without limitation, those pertaining to employee health and safety, air quality standards and emissions, water usage, wastewater and stormwater discharges, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, hazardous and radioactive and other waste management, plant and wildlife protection, remediation of contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, procurement of certain materials used in our operations, groundwater quality and the use of explosives. These requirements have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations, earnings and competitive position. Environmental laws and regulation continue to evolve which may require us to meet stricter standards and give rise to greater enforcement, result in increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, and result in a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future laws, regulations, permits or legal requirements, as well as the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements, may require substantial increases in capital or operating costs to achieve and maintain compliance or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit operations, or other restrictions upon, our current or future operations or result in the imposition of fines and penalties for failure to comply.
Complying with these regulations is complicated and requires significant attention and resources. We expect to continue to incur significant sums for ongoing operating environmental expenditures, including salaries, and the costs for monitoring, compliance, remediation, reporting, pollution control equipment and permitting. In addition, we plan to invest significant capital to maintain and upgrade certain infrastructure to ensure we operate in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner.
