Overview
 
Kona Grill, Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company” or “we,” “us,” and “our”) currently owns and operates 34 restaurants in 20 states throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. In addition, we have two international restaurants that operate under franchise agreements. Our restaurants offer freshly prepared food, attentive service, and an upscale contemporary ambience that create an exceptional, yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete. Our restaurants feature contemporary American favorites, award-winning sushi and an extensive selection of alcoholic beverages. Our menu items are prepared from scratch at each restaurant location, creating memorable flavor profiles that appeal to a wide-range of customers. Our diverse menu is complemented by a full-service bar offering a broad assortment of wines, craft cocktails, and beers. We believe that our innovative menu items, generous portions, and flexible price points provide customers with a compelling value proposition and allow us to attract a diverse customer base.
 
Our restaurants seat an average of 290 customers and are comprised of multiple dining areas that incorporate modern design elements to create an upscale ambience that reinforces our high standards of food and service. Our main dining area, full-service bar, indoor/outdoor patio, and sushi bar provide a choice of atmospheres and a variety of environments designed to attract new customers and encourage repeat visits from regular customers. Our restaurants are generally located in high-activity areas such as retail centers, shopping malls, and lifestyle centers that are situated near commercial office space and residential housing to attract customers throughout the day.
 
Strategy
 
We grew the number of restaurants significantly from 2013 to 2016 and doubled the size of the Company from 23 restaurants in 2012 to 46 restaurants by 2017. We have currently discontinued developing new restaurants to give our existing base of restaurants the opportunity to mature, conserve our cash resources and have closed certain unprofitable restaurants. We are evaluating strategic alternatives including the sale of the Company, the potential sale of the Company’s assets through a Chapter 11 filing, refinancing or other alternatives, including the closure of additional restaurants.
 
In March 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team, engaged Piper Jaffray as our financial advisor to assist with the evaluation of strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of our business. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that we may undertake or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock.
 
Additionally, we are in discussions with our secured lenders in an effort to pursue various strategic alternatives.  We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute any strategic alternatives we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of our credit facility.
 
We may be required to file for protection in bankruptcy, even if we are successful in effecting a sale of our business or improving our capital structure. Any bankruptcy proceeding may result in the holders of our common stock receiving no proceeds.
 
It is possible that even a successful implementation of one of the strategic alternatives that we are pursuing will require us to make a filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Our seeking relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, whether or not such relief leads to a quick emergence from Chapter 11, could materially adversely affect the relationships between us and our existing and potential customers, employees, suppliers, and others.
 
Changes in Senior Management Team
 
Effective March 31, 2019, Marcus Jundt resigned from our Board of Directors and as Chief Executive Officer. On April 2, 2019, Christi Hing, our Chief Financial Officer, was appointed as the principal executive officer of the Company.

Competitive Strengths
 
The restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, value proposition, ambiance, service and location. We believe that the key strengths of our business include the following:

● | Innovative Menu Selections with Mainstream Appeal. We offer a menu of freshly prepared, high quality food that includes a diverse selection of contemporary American favorites and award-winning sushi items to appeal to a wide range of tastes, preferences, and price points. We prepare our dishes from scratch at each restaurant location using original recipes with generous portions and creative and appealing presentations. Our more than 40 signature sauces and dressings create memorable flavor profiles and further differentiate our menu items.

● | Distinctive Casual Dining Experience. Our creative menu, personalized service, and contemporary restaurant design blend together to create an inviting dining experience. Our restaurants feature a unique layout and utilize modern, eye-catching design elements to enhance the customer experience. Our multiple dining areas provide customers with many distinct dining environments and atmospheres to suit a wide-range of dining occasions. Our open exhibition-style kitchen and sushi bar further emphasize the quality and freshness of our food that are the cornerstones of our concept.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significant Bar and Happy Hour Business. Our high-energy bar and patio offer a distinctive atmosphere where customers can enjoy our alcoholic beverage offerings. Our patio is a popular place for customers to enjoy our high-value happy hour and reverse happy hour offerings, where full portions of select items are offered at reduced price points. Our patio, which is enclosed in colder climate locations, provides a year-round sales opportunity and is a key driver in generating business during non-traditional periods. Aggregate revenue during these non-peak periods accounted for 22.4% of our total sales during 2018, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Personalized Customer Service. Our commitment to make every experience exceptional reinforces our upscale ambience and helps distinguish us from other casual dining restaurants. We train our service personnel to be friendly and knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant, which helps us provide personalized customer service that is designed to ensure an enjoyable dining experience and exceed our customers’ expectations. Our kitchen staff completes extensive training to ensure that menu items are precisely prepared to provide a consistent experience. We believe our focus on high service standards underscores our customer-centric philosophy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple Daypart Model. Our appetizers, entrees, and sushi offerings provide a flexible selection of items that can be ordered individually or shared allowing customers to dine with us during traditional lunch and dinner meal periods as well as between customary dining periods such as in the late afternoon and late night. The lively ambience of our patio and bar areas provides a unique atmosphere for customers to enjoy before or after they dine with us. Our sushi bar provides another dining venue for customers while offering a wide selection of creative and flavorful menu items for health-conscious customers. We believe that our ability to attract customers throughout the day distinguishes us from many other casual dining chains.

Restaurant Sales Goals
 
Our goal for existing restaurants is to increase unit volumes through consistent execution of our food and drink offerings. We are focused on key initiatives designed to drive traffic, increase sales and enhance the customer experience. We have revitalized our legendary happy hour by expanding the number of food and drink offerings, reducing prices and extending the hours that happy hour is available. We are revamping our core menu to bring back certain items that made us successful in the past and right-sizing the menu to allow for consistent and timely delivering of our food and drink offerings. We offer online ordering for the convenience of our customers and have also partnered with several companies for delivery services to drive incremental sales growth. We believe the strength of our differentiated concept and the appeal of our contemporary design will enable us to gain market share over time. Furthermore, we continue to focus on the quality of our service and hospitality with extensive training for our service staff on our menu offerings. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Konavore loyalty program to encourage customers to visit our restaurants more frequently. The loyalty rewards program awards a customer one point for every $1 spent. When points are accumulated a reward to be used on future purchases is earned. We also have focused on social marketing and engaging with customers through various social media. 
 
Our ability to generate sales throughout the day is a key strength of our concept. The following table depicts the amount and percentage of contribution for each daypart of overall revenues during 2018.

Menu
 
Our menu features a wide selection of appetizers, salads, flatbreads, sandwiches, noodles, sushi, seafood, signature entrees, and desserts. Our appetizers include socially interactive items that can be eaten individually or easily shared among customers. Our signature entrees feature various sauces and offer customers generous portions that are impressive in presentation and in taste. For example, our most popular entrée is the Macadamia Nut Chicken served with shoyu-cream sauce and accompanied by mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Other favorites include Miso-Sake Sea Bass served with jasmine rice and seared green beans and Sweet-Chili Glazed Salmon served with shrimp and pork fried rice, crispy soy brussels sprouts and a sweet chili sauce.
 
We also offer an extensive assortment of sushi that includes traditional favorites as well as distinctive specialty sushi and sashimi items such as our Voodoo Roll made with spicy crawfish mix and avocado rolled inside of seaweed and topped with a habanero tuna mix or the Bama Roll made with crab mix, cream cheese and jalapeno in soy paper topped with tuna, avocado, fish roe and spicy mayo. Sushi sales accounted for 28% of our total revenue during 2018.
 
Our menu, coupled with an expansive selection of sushi, offers ample choices for health-conscious customers. We take great pride in providing our customers the full Kona Grill experience without compromising their dietary needs and restrictions. We offer gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options.
 
The versatility of our menu enables us to provide customers with dishes that can be enjoyed outside of the traditional lunch and dinner meal periods, as well as to serve our customers’ requirements for a variety of dining occasions, including everyday dining, business lunches, social gatherings and special occasions. We also offer catering, group dining menus, and sushi platters to provide additional opportunities to serve our customers’ needs. In general, our menu is consistent from location to location. We typically update our menu in the spring and the fall and make enhancements to existing items or introduce new items based on customer feedback, which helps ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers.
 
Our restaurants also offer an extensive selection of bottled and draft beers, wines by the glass or bottle, sake and an extensive selection of liquors and craft cocktail drinks. Alcoholic beverage sales represented 26% of our total revenue during 2018.
 
Food Preparation, Quality Control, and Purchasing 
 
We believe that we have some of the highest food quality standards in the industry. Our standards are designed to protect food products throughout the preparation process. We provide detailed specifications to suppliers for food ingredients, products, and supplies. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in our restaurants through hiring, training and supervision of personnel. We require annual recertification training for all employees, and each employee receives extensive training relating to food and beverage preparation and restaurant operations. We also instruct kitchen managers and staff on safety, sanitation, housekeeping, repair and maintenance, product and service specifications, ordering and receiving products, and quality assurance. Our restaurant managers are compliant with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, or HACCP, requirements. We monitor minimum cook temperature requirements and conduct twice-a-day kitchen and food quality inspections to further assure the safety and quality of all of the items we use in our restaurants. We have a ServSafe alcohol certification program, where front of house employees are trained and tested to ensure we are providing responsible alcohol service. Further, to monitor and ensure compliance with required guidelines, we evaluate our employees on their ability to maintain sanitary conditions in their respective restaurants.

We source our products and supplies with reputable and high-quality providers that are capable of providing consistent, reliable distribution to all of our restaurants. We have arrangements with national and local distributors and specialty food suppliers who provide high-quality ingredients and perishable food products. These distributors and suppliers are required to comply with food safety guidelines mandated by HACCP, the Food & Drug Administration and local statutes and regulations of the particular state, county or municipality.
 
Our goal is to maximize purchasing efficiencies and obtain the lowest possible prices for ingredients, products, and supplies, while maintaining the highest quality. We are committed to purchasing high-quality ingredients for our restaurants at reasonable prices. We use fresh ingredients and, as a result, we maintain only modest inventories. We believe that competitively priced alternative distribution sources are available should those channels be necessary. We negotiate national supply contracts and prices for food supply throughout all of our restaurants, monitor quality control and consistency of the food supplied to restaurants, and oversee delivery of food on a nationwide basis. In order to provide the freshest ingredients and products, and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, we utilize an automated food cost and inventory system to assist each restaurant’s management team in determining daily order requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies. The management team orders accordingly from approved suppliers, and all deliveries are inspected to assure that the items received meet our quality specifications and negotiated prices.
 
Restaurant Operations
 
Executive and Restaurant Management
 
Our senior management team continually monitors restaurant operations to assure the quality of products and services and the maintenance of facilities. We have procedures to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and provide centralized and individual restaurant support systems. Our corporate operations team and directors of operation have primary responsibility for oversight of our restaurants and analyze restaurant-level performance and strategic planning. We currently employ four directors of operations who are each responsible for overseeing the restaurants in a specific region. The directors of operations’ responsibilities include supporting the general managers and helping each restaurant achieve the sales and cash flow targets for their restaurant as well as providing insight for decision making in such areas as food and beverage, people development, and process improvements to enhance the efficiency of operations and the dining experience for our customers.
 
Our typical restaurant management team consists of a general manager, executive chef, sous chef and two to three additional managers depending upon the sales volume of each restaurant. Our restaurants employ on average approximately 75 non-management employees, many of whom work part-time. The general manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, including the hiring, training, personnel development, execution of local marketing programs, and operating results. The chefs are responsible for overseeing the preparation of kitchen and sushi items, maintaining product quality, and closely monitoring food costs and department labor costs.
 
Training
 
In order to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants, we carefully train and supervise restaurant personnel and adhere to high standards related to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of our restaurants. Our restaurant personnel participate in both initial and ongoing training programs under the direction of our director of training. Each restaurant manager completes a formal training program that is comprised of a mix of online and on-the-job instruction. The training covers all aspects of management philosophy and overall restaurant operations, including supervisory skills, operating and performance standards, accounting procedures, IT systems and employee selection and training necessary for top-quality restaurant operations. The training programs also involve intensive understanding of our menu and other key service protocols.

Recruitment and Retention
 
Our success is highly dependent upon the ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified individuals who are capable of successfully managing our high-volume restaurants. We believe that our high unit volume, the image and atmosphere of the Kona Grill concept, and career advancement and employee benefit programs enable us to attract high quality management and restaurant personnel. We offer restaurant management personnel competitive wages and benefits, including medical insurance and participation in our 401(k) plan with a company match. We motivate and prepare our restaurant personnel by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibility and advancement. Furthermore, the management team of each restaurant shares in a bonus tied to the sales and overall profitability of their restaurant. We believe that our compensation package for managers and restaurant employees is comparable to or better than those provided by other casual dining restaurants. We believe our compensation policies help us attract quality personnel.
Information Systems
 
We believe that our management information systems enable us to increase the speed and accuracy of order-taking and pricing, efficiently schedule labor to better serve customers, monitor labor costs, assist in product purchasing and menu mix management, promptly access financial and operating data, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant-level information and reporting.
 
We utilize an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and between each restaurant and our corporate office. This system includes a point-of-sale (POS) local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant. Additionally, we utilize the POS system to authorize, batch, and transmit credit card transactions, record employee time clock information, and produce a variety of management reports. The POS is integrated with food cost and labor scheduling software as well as our accounting system and incorporates a redundancy and back-up emergency operating plan on a temporary basis if the system experiences downtime.
 
We transmit electronically select information that is captured from the POS system to our corporate office on a daily basis. This information flow enables senior management to monitor operating results with daily and weekly sales analysis, detailed labor and food cost information, and comparisons between actual and budgeted operating results. We continually evaluate both our restaurant information systems and corporate office information systems to enhance operations.
 
Advertising and Marketing 
 
Our ongoing advertising and marketing strategy consists of a loyalty program, social media, grass-root local marketing, various public relations activities and word-of-mouth recommendations. We believe that these mediums are key components in driving customer trial and repeat usage. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in marketing and branding efforts, primarily to increase revenue and expand brand awareness. In addition, we use various social media platforms and our website, www.konagrill.com, to promote brand awareness.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Key competitive factors in the industry include the taste, quality, and price of food and drink offerings, quality and speed of customer service, brand name recognition, attractiveness of facilities, restaurant location, customer convenience and overall dining experience.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors, as follows:
 

● | We offer a broad menu of contemporary American favorites, award-winning sushi items and specialty cocktails; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of restaurant personnel and adherence to high standards related to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of our restaurants;


● | Our innovative menu with attractive price points, attentive service, and contemporary restaurant design with multiple environments blend together to create our upscale casual dining experience and enables us to attract a broad customer demographic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We offer online ordering through our website, catering and group dining menus, and partner with third parties for delivery service of our food and drink offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors, there are a substantial number of restaurants and food service providers that compete directly and indirectly with us, many of which have significantly greater financial resources, higher revenue, and greater economies of scale. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; national and regional employment statistics; demographic trends; weather conditions; the cost and availability of raw materials, labor, and energy; purchasing power; governmental regulations; and local competitive factors. Any change in these or other related factors or negative publicity relating to food safety could adversely affect our restaurant operations. Accordingly, we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concept over time to protect their longer-term competitiveness. Additionally, there is competition for highly qualified restaurant management employees and for attractive locations suitable for high volume restaurants.
 
Trademarks
 
We have registered the service marks “Kona Grill” and “Konavore” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and “Kona Grill” in certain foreign jurisdictions. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights, such as our distinctive menu offerings and signature sauce recipes, have significant value and are important to the marketing of our concept. We have protected in the past and will continue to vigorously protect our proprietary rights. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept and any litigation to enforce our rights will likely be costly. In addition, other local restaurant companies with names similar to ours may try to prevent us from using our marks in those locales.
Government Regulation
 
Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments and bureaus of alcohol control, health, sanitation, zoning, and fire and to periodic review by state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurants are located. Delays in obtaining, or denials of, or revocation or temporary suspension of, necessary licenses or approvals could have a material adverse impact on our restaurant operations.
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We have not encountered any material problems relating to alcoholic beverage licenses or permits to date. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain its liquor license would adversely affect that restaurant’s operations and profitability.
 
 6



We are subject to “dram shop” statutes in most of the states in which we operate. Those statutes generally provide a person who has been injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance which we believe is consistent with coverage in the full-service restaurant industry. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a “dram shop” statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime. Several states have set minimum wage rates higher than the current federal level. A significant number of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to state and federal minimum wage laws and, accordingly, state minimum wage increases implemented during the last several years have increased our labor costs. Increases in the minimum wage rate or the cost of workers’ compensation insurance, changes in tip-credit provisions, employee benefit costs (including costs associated with mandated health insurance coverage), or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect our operating results. To our knowledge, we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state, and local laws affecting our business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed 2,968 people of whom 2,936 worked in our restaurants and 32 were employed at our corporate office. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike, or labor dispute. We consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.
Access to Information
 
Our website is located at www.konagrill.com. The information on our website is not part of this filing. Through our website, we make available free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the SEC. We also post on our website the charters of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees; Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers; Insider Trading Policy and any other corporate governance materials required by SEC or NASDAQ regulations.
