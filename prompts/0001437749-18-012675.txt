Acquisitions.
 
Contrail, Jet Yard and AirCo.  On July 18, 2016, Contrail Aviation, a subsidiary of the Company, completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Contrail Aviation Support, Inc. (“Contrail Seller”). Prior to the asset sale, Contrail Seller, based in Verona, Wisconsin, engaged in the business of acquiring surplus commercial jet engines and components and supplying surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components. In connection with the acquisition, Contrail Aviation offered employment to all of Contrail Seller’s employees. The acquisition consideration paid to Contrail Seller included equity membership units in Contrail Aviation representing 21% of the total equity membership units in Contrail Aviation. As a result, the Company owns equity membership units in Contrail Aviation representing the remaining 79% of the total equity membership units in Contrail Aviation. In addition, Contrail Aviation has agreed to pay as additional deferred consideration to Contrail Seller up to a maximum of $1.5 million per year and $3.0 million in the aggregate based on Contrail Aviation’s EBITDA (as defined in the purchase agreement) measured during periods over the five years following the acquisition. Contrail Aviation and Contrail Seller also entered into put and call options permitting, at any time after the fifth anniversary of the asset sale closing date, Contrail Aviation at its election to purchase from Contrail Seller, and permitting Contrail Seller at its election to require Contrail Aviation to purchase from Contrail Seller, all of Contrail Seller’s equity membership interests in Contrail Aviation at a price to be agreed upon, or failing such an agreement to be determined pursuant to third-party appraisals in a specified process.
 
On October 3, 2016, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company, Stratus Aero Partners, LLC (formerly, Global Aviation Partners, LLC), acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Jet Yard, LLC (“Jet Yard”). Jet Yard is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and its principal asset at the time of the Company’s acquisition was a lease from Pinal County, Arizona to approximately 48.5 acres of land at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona. Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and prior to our acquisition maintained de minimus operations.
 
The aggregate cash consideration paid in these two acquisition transactions described above, after closing date adjustments and not including potential deferred payments to Contrail Seller, was approximately $4,048,000.
 
On May 2, 2017 and June 1, 2017, our newly formed subsidiaries, AirCo, LLC and AirCo Services, LLC (collectively, “AirCo”) acquired the inventory and principal business assets, and assumed specified liabilities, of Aircraft Instrument and Radio Company, Incorporated, and Aircraft Instrument and Radio Services, Inc. (collectively, the “AirCo Sellers”). The acquired business, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, distributes and sells airplane and aviation parts and maintains a license under Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration. The consideration paid for the acquired business was $2,400,000.
 
D&D GSE Support. On October 31, 2016, GAS acquired, effective as of October 1, 2016, substantially all of the assets of D&D GSE Support, Inc. (“D&D”) which was in the business of marketing, selling and providing aviation repair, equipment, parts, and maintenance sales services and products at the Fort Lauderdale airport. The total amount paid at closing in connection with this acquisition was $400,000, with an additional $100,000 paid 30 days after closing and an additional $100,000 payable in equal monthly installments of $16,667 commencing on November 1, 2016. Earn-out payments of $100,000 were paid in October 2017 based on specified performance for the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2017.
TFS Partners LLC. On June 7, 2017, Space Age Insurance Company (“SAIC”) invested $500,000 for a 40% interest in TFS Partners LLC (“TFS Partners”), a single-purpose investment entity organized by SAIC and other investors, for the purpose of making an investment in a limited liability company, The Fence Store LLC (“Fence Store LLC”), organized for the purpose of acquiring substantially all of the assets of The Fence Store, Inc. (“Fence Store Inc.”). TFS Partners acquired a 60% interest in Fence Store LLC, which has completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Fence Store Inc. Prior to this transaction, Fence Store Inc. operated a business under the tradename “Town and Country Fence” selling and installing residential and commercial fencing in the greater Twin Cities, Minnesota area. Fence Store LLC intends to continue this business.
Blue Clay Capital Management, LLC. On December 15, 2017, BCCM, Inc. (“BCCM”), a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Blue Clay Capital Management, LLC (“Blue Clay Capital”). In connection with the transaction, BCCM acquired the assets of, and assumed certain liabilities of, Blue Clay Capital in return for payment to Blue Clay Capital of $1.00, subject to adjustment for Blue Clay Capital’s net working capital as of the closing date.

In connection with the acquisition, a Partnership Interest Conversion and General Partner Admittance Agreement (“Conversion Agreement”) was entered into effective December 31, 2017 between Blue Clay Capital, BCCM Advisors, and various Blue Clay Capital investment funds. Per the Conversion Agreement, Blue Clay Capital sold to BCCM Advisors, and BCCM Advisors purchased from Blue Clay, the general partnership interests in certain investment funds previously managed by Blue Clay Capital (as specified above) for a purchase price equal to, with respect to each general partnership, of (i) one percent (1%) of the aggregate capital accounts of each fund as valued on December 31, 2017 and (ii) $100,000 (or $10,000 in the case of Blue Clay Capital SMid-Cap LO, LP). Upon acquisition of each of the general partnership interests, BCCM Advisors was admitted as the general partner of each fund.
 
Overnight Air Cargo.
 
MAC and CSA are two of seven companies in the U.S. that have North American feeder airlines under contract with FedEx. With a relationship with FedEx spanning over 35 years, MAC and CSA operate and maintain Cessna Caravan, ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft that fly daily small-package cargo routes throughout the eastern United States, upper Midwest and the Caribbean. MAC and CSA’s revenues are derived principally pursuant to “dry-lease” service contracts with FedEx.
 
On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx which together cover all of the revenue aircraft operated by MAC and CSA and replaced all prior dry-lease service contracts.  These dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by MAC and CSA in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate.  These dry-lease agreements provide that FedEx determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made by MAC and CSA, respectively.  The current dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of MAC and CSA’s costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Unlike prior dry-lease contracts, under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by MAC and CSA in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by MAC and CSA.  Under the dry-lease agreements, MAC and CSA are required to perform maintenance of the leased aircraft in return for a maintenance fee based upon an hourly maintenance labor rate, which has been increased from the rate in place under the prior dry-lease service contracts. Under prior dry-lease service contracts, the hourly maintenance labor rate had not been adjusted since 2008. The dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to MAC and CSA of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated.  The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the new dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and the fact that certain operational costs borne by MAC and CSA are not reimbursed. The amount of the administrative fee is subject to adjustment based on the number of aircraft operated, routes flown and whether aircraft are considered to be soft-parked. Since MAC and CSA entered into the new dry-lease agreements in 2015, they have periodically entered into amendments to the agreements with FedEx that have adjusted the administrative fees payable under these agreements. These adjustments, which have generally been made on an annual basis, have resulted in annual period-to-period volatility in MAC and CSA’s profitability. MAC and CSA entered into such an amendment effective as of June 1, 2017.
 
On June 1, 2016, the current dry-lease agreements were amended to extend the expiration date to May 31, 2020. The dry-lease agreements may be terminated by FedEx or MAC and CSA, respectively, at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, each of the dry-lease agreements provides that FedEx may terminate the agreement upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes MAC or CSA’s only customer, or MAC or CSA employs fewer than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The Company believes that the short-term nature of its agreements with FedEx is standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry, where performance is measured on a daily basis.
 
As of March 31, 2018, MAC and CSA had an aggregate of 79 aircraft under its dry-lease agreements with FedEx.  Included within the 79 aircraft, four Cessna Caravan aircrafts are considered soft-parked. Soft-parked aircraft remain covered under our agreements with FedEx although at a reduced administrative fee compared to aircraft that are in operation.  MAC and CSA continue to perform maintenance on soft-parked aircraft, but they are not crewed and do not operate on scheduled routes.

Revenues from MAC and CSA’s contracts with FedEx accounted for approximately 38% and 47% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of FedEx as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. MAC and CSA are not contractually precluded from providing services to other parties and MAC occasionally provides third-party maintenance services to other airline customers and the U.S. military.
 
MAC and CSA operate under separate aviation certifications. MAC is certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications permit MAC to operate and maintain aircraft that can carry a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds on the Cessna Caravan 208B under Part 135 and a maximum cargo capacity of 14,000 pounds for the ATR-42 and 17,800 pounds for the ATR-72 aircraft under Part 121. CSA is certified to operate and maintain aircraft under Part 135 of the FAA regulations. This certification permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds.
 
MAC and CSA, together, operated the following FedEx-owned cargo aircraft as of March 31, 2018:
 

Type of Aircraft | Model Year | | Form of Ownership | | Number of Aircraft
----------------------------------------+------------+-----------+-------------------+-----------+-------------------
Cessna Caravan 208B (single turbo prop) | | 1985-2012 | | Dry lease | | 61
ATR-42 (twin turbo prop) | | 1992 | | Dry lease | | 9 
ATR-72 (twin turbo prop) | | 1992 | | Dry lease | | 9 
 | | | | | | 79

 

The Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (“AAIP”). The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours. The current engine overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 8,000 hours.
 
The ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 continuous airworthiness maintenance program. The program consists of A and C service checks as well as calendar checks ranging from weekly to 12 years in duration. The engine overhaul period is 6,000 hours.
 
MAC and CSA operate in a niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market. MAC and CSA are two of seven carriers that operate within the United States as FedEx feeder carriers. MAC and CSA are benchmarked against the other five FedEx feeders based on safety, reliability, compliance with federal, state and applicable foreign regulations, price and other service related measurements. Accurate industry data is not available to indicate the Company’s position within its marketplace (in large measure because all of the Company’s direct competitors are privately held), but management believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute the largest contract carrier of the type described immediately above.
 
FedEx conducts periodic audits of MAC and CSA, and these audits are an integral part of the relationship between the carrier and FedEx. The audits test adherence to the dry-lease agreements and assess the carrier’s overall internal control environment, particularly as related to the processing of invoices of FedEx-reimbursable costs. The scope of these audits typically extends beyond simple validation of invoice data against the third-party supporting documentation. The audit teams generally investigate the operator’s processes and procedures for strong internal control procedures. The Company believes satisfactory audit results are critical to maintaining its relationship with FedEx. The audits conducted by FedEx are not designed to provide any assurance with respect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and investors, in evaluating the Company’s consolidated financial statements, should not rely in any way on any such examination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
The Company’s overnight air cargo operations are not materially seasonal.

Ground Equipment Sales.
 
GGS is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment sold to domestic and international passenger and cargo airlines, ground handling companies, the United States Air Force (“USAF”), airports and industrial customers. GGS’s product line includes aircraft deicers, scissor-type lifts, military and civilian decontamination units, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other specialized equipment. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, sales of deicing equipment accounted for approximately 77% of GGS’s revenues, compared to 49% in the prior fiscal year.
 
GGS designs and engineers its products. Components acquired from third-party suppliers are used in the assembly of its finished products. Components are sourced from a diverse supply chain. The primary components for mobile deicing equipment are the chassis (which is a commercial medium or heavy-duty truck), the fluid storage tank, a boom system, the fluid delivery system and heating equipment. The price of these components is influenced by raw material costs, principally high-strength carbon steels and stainless steel. GGS utilizes continuous improvements and other techniques to improve efficiencies and designs to minimize product price increases to its customers, to respond to regulatory changes, such as emission standards, and to incorporate technological improvements to enhance the efficiency of GGS’s products. Improvements have included the development of single operator mobile deicing units to replace units requiring two operators, a patented premium deicing blend system and a more efficient forced-air deicing system.
 
GGS manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from 700 to 2,800 gallons. GGS also offers fixed-pedestal-mounted deicers. Each model can be customized as requested by the customer, including single operator configuration, fire suppressant equipment, open basket or enclosed cab design, a patented forced-air deicing nozzle, on-board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage, and color and style of the exterior finish. GGS also manufactures five models of scissor-lift equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft, and has developed a line of decontamination equipment, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment.
 
GGS competes primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of its products, prompt delivery, service and price. The market for aviation ground service equipment is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry, weather patterns and changes in technology.
 
GGS’s mobile deicing equipment business has historically been seasonal, with revenues typically being lower in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. The Company has continued its efforts to reduce GGS’s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its international and domestic customer base and its product line. In July 2009, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF, which expired in July 2014. On May 15, 2014, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF. The initial contract award is for two years through July 13, 2016 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF, the first of which was exercised, extending the contract term to July 13, 2018. The value of the contract, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends upon annual requirements and available funding to the USAF.
 
Last year, GGS sold one deicer, the pre-production unit for the GL 1800 model deicer under this contract, to the USAF under the above contract during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, which pre-production unit was accepted by the USAF. This year, GGS sold one deicer, the pre-production unit for the ER 2875 model deicer under this contract, to the USAF under the above contract during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and the unit was accepted by the USAF. Also, during this year, GGS has received delivery orders from the USAF for both GL 1800 and ER 2875 models, has put them in the production schedule and is successfully completing and having the units accepted per normal operations. As the delivery and acceptance of the pre-production units was required and completed by the USAF, additional orders have been submitted and additional orders are expected.
 
In September 2010, GGS was awarded a contract to supply flight-line tow tractors to the USAF. The contract award was for one year commencing September 28, 2010 with four additional one-year extension options exercisable by the USAF. All option periods under the contract were exercised and the contract expired in September 2015, though it continues to govern orders placed under the contract prior to its expiration. Sale of flight-line tow tractors under this contract have been at very low margins. This contract was completed in March 2017 and GGS had no revenues for sales of flight-line tow tractors in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared to sales of approximately $3,174,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

Ground Support Services.

GAS provides aircraft ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services. At March 31, 2018, GAS was providing ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services to more than 145 customers at 128 North American airports.
 
Approximately 24% and 28%, respectively, of GAS’s revenues in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were derived from services under a contract with LSG SkyChefs. The LSG SkyChefs contract is an evergreen agreement without a specific termination date but does include a 60-day termination clause for either party. In addition, approximately 23% and 14% of GAS’s revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were derived from services under a contract with Delta Airlines. In December 2016, Delta awarded GAS a five-year contract at 28 locations in connection with their periodic request-for-proposal (RFP) process. Most significantly, GAS was awarded the maintenance of the baggage handling system and passenger boarding bridges for Delta’s hub operation at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. Not all Delta locations serviced by GAS were included in this RFP. At March 31, 2018, GAS had over 132 technicians serving Delta in 47 locations. In addition to expanded locations with Delta, during the fiscal year 2018, GAS added multiple service locations to other key customers. In total, during the fiscal year 2018, GAS added 2 new served locations and over 22 additional technicians.
 
GAS competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and pricing of its services. The market for ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry. GAS’s maintenance service business is not materially seasonal.
 
Printing Equipment and Maintenance.

The Company determined that for accounting purposes, it had obtained control over Delphax in conjunction with the acquisition of the equity and debt interests on November 24, 2015 and has consolidated Delphax in Air T’s consolidated financial statements beginning on November 24, 2015. Delphax’s business has included the design, manufacture and sale of advanced digital print production equipment (including high-speed, high-volume cut-sheet and continuous roll-fed printers), maintenance contracts, spare parts, supplies and consumable items for these systems. The equipment, spare parts, supplies and consumable items have been manufactured, and maintenance and services have been provided by Delphax Canada and such products and services have been sold through Delphax, Delphax Canada and Delphax subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom and France. A significant portion of Delphax’s net sales has historically been related to service and support provided after the sale, including the sale of consumable items for installed printing systems. Delphax’s legacy consumables production business had been expected to generate cash flow while Delphax rolled-out its next generation élan commercial inkjet printer.
 
The Company’s investments in Delphax were intended to support the commercial rollout and manufacturing costs of the new Delphax elan® 500 digital color print system, which combines advances in inkjet and paper-handling technologies in a production class sheet-fed system offering full CMYK color and 1600 dpi print quality at speeds of up to 500 letter impressions per minute. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, Delphax was informed by its largest customer that the customer had decided to accelerate its plans for removing Delphax legacy printing systems from production and that Delphax should, as a consequence, expect the future volume of legacy product orders from the customer to decline markedly from prior forecasts. Furthermore, the future timeframe over which orders could be expected from this customer was sharply curtailed. In addition to this specific customer communication, Delphax also experienced a broad-based decline in legacy product customer demand during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Sales of Delphax’s new elan® printer system also had not materialized to expectations.
 
The above described adverse business developments drove significant negative operating results and led to severe liquidity constraints for Delphax. In addition to other measures intended to respond to developments, Delphax engaged an outside advisory firm to assist with operations, cost reductions and expense rationalization, and to provide an objective assessment and recommendations regarding Delphax’s business outlook and alternative courses of action. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a number of Delphax employees were either severed or furloughed. For most of fiscal year 2017, Delphax’s operations have been maintained at a significantly curtailed level.

On January 6, 2017, the Company acquired all rights, and assumed all obligations, of a third-party lender under a senior credit agreement (the “Delphax Senior Credit Agreement”) with Delphax and Delphax Canada providing for a $7.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility, subject to a borrowing base of North American accounts receivable and inventory, including obligations, if any, to fund future borrowings under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. In connection with this transaction, the Company, Delphax and Delphax Canada entered into an amendment to the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement to, among other things, reduce the maximum amount of borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement from $7.0 million to $2.5 million and to revise the borrowing base to include in the borrowing base 100% of purchase orders from customers for products up to $500,000. On January 6, 2017, the Company notified Delphax and Delphax Canada of certain “Events of Default” (as defined under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement) existing under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the existence of events of default under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement, during the first six calendar months of 2017, the Company permitted additional borrowings under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement to, among other things, fund a final production run by Delphax Canada of consumable products for Delphax’s legacy printing systems, which production run was primarily completed over the first six months of calendar 2017.
 
In light of continuing events of default under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement and the conclusion of final production run by Delphax Canada of consumable products for Delphax’s legacy printing systems, on July 13, 2017, the Company delivered a demand for payment and Notice of Intention to Enforce Security to Delphax Canada. On August 10, 2017, the Company foreclosed on all personal property and rights to undertakings of Delphax Canada. The Company foreclosed as a secured creditor with respect to amounts owed to it by Delphax Canada under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. The Company provided notice of its intent to foreclose to Delphax Canada and its secured creditors and shareholders on July 26, 2017. The outstanding amount owed to the Company by Delphax Canada under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement on July 26, 2017 was approximately $1,510,000. The Company also submitted an application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bankruptcy and Insolvency (the "Ontario Court") seeking that Delphax Canada be adjudged bankrupt. On August 8, 2017, the Ontario Court issued an order adjudging Delphax Canada to be bankrupt. The recipients of the foreclosure notice did not object to the foreclosure or redeem. As a result, the foreclosure was completed on August 10, 2017, and the Company accepted the personal property and rights to undertakings of Delphax Canada in satisfaction of the amount secured by the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement.
 
With it being adjudged bankrupt on August 8, 2017, Delphax Canada ceased to have capacity to deal with its property. The property of Delphax Canada vested in the trustee in bankruptcy of Delphax Canada subject to the rights of secured creditors. The Company’s rights under Delphax Senior Credit Agreement permitted it to foreclose upon the personal property and rights of undertakings of Delphax Canada. Since the Company foreclosed on Delphax Canada’s assets within very close time proximity to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings and because the bankruptcy and foreclosure were undertaken in contemplation of one another, the Company treated these as one single financial reporting event. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company considered whether Delphax Canada was still a business post-bankruptcy and foreclosure of the assets by the Company and concluded that Delphax Canada no longer constituted a business as it is defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, derecognition of Delphax Canada’s liabilities will occur when Delphax Canada is legally released as the primary obligor with respect to the liabilities in the bankruptcy proceedings. As of March 31, 2018, the bankruptcy proceedings were ongoing in accordance with Canadian law and, therefore, Delphax Canada was still the primary obligor of its liabilities.
 
Air T has contributed certain of the assets acquired in foreclosure to a newly formed subsidiary, Delphax Solutions, Inc. (“Delphax Solutions”), which has contracted with Delphax to make available for purchase legacy parts and consumables, as well as to serve as a temporary fulfilment provider to Delphax for logistics and sales order processing. In addition, Delphax Solutions intends to pursue market success for the elan® printer system, as Delphax is no longer actively selling its product lines. Delphax Solutions has entered into an agreement with Delphax for a license for intellectual property and rights to the elan® printing system and technologies in return for royalties based on sales. Delphax Solutions intends pursue sales of the elan® printing system and related product lines both directly and through qualified resellers and agents.

Commercial Jet Engines and Parts.
 
Contrail Aviation and Jet Yard, added during fiscal year 2017, and AirCo, formed in May 2017 to acquire the business of the AirCo Sellers, comprise the commercial jet engines and parts segment of the Company’s operations. Contrail Aviation is a supplier of surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components. Its primary focus revolves around the CFM International CFM56-3/-5/-7 engines and the International Aero Engines V2500A5 engine, which power the two most prevalent narrow body, single aisle aircraft that are currently flown commercially—the Boeing 737 Classic / 737 NG and the Airbus A320 family. Contrail Aviation acquires commercial jet engines and components for disassembly and/or overhaul to useable components. Components are overhauled by third-party FAA-authorized repair agencies and are then held in inventory for resale. Customers include major airlines, original equipment manufacturers and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service providers.

Contrail Aviation’s operations are housed in a 21,000 square-foot office and warehouse facility in Verona, Wisconsin that is leased from an entity owned by the shareholder of Contrail Seller, who joined Contrail Aviation as its Chief Executive Officer in connection with the acquisition, and by the individual appointed as Chief Financial Officer of Contrail Aviation following the acquisition.
 
Jet Yard offers commercial aircraft storage, storage maintenance and aircraft disassembly/part-out services at facilities leased at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona. The prevailing climate in this area of Arizona provides conditions conducive to long-term storage of aircraft. Jet Yard is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA and it leases approximately 48.5 acres of land under a lease agreement with Pinal County, Arizona. Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and had maintained de minimus operations from formation through the date it was acquired by the Company. The lease expires in May 2046 with an option to renew for an additional 30-year period (though the lease to a 2.6-acre parcel of the leased premises may be terminated by Pinal County upon 90 days’ notice). The lease provides for an initial annual rent of $27,000, which rental rate escalates based on a schedule in annual increments during the first seven years of the lease (at which time the annual rental rate would be $152,000) and increases by an additional five percent for each three-year period thereafter. Because the rental expense will be accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, the rental expense in the initial years will exceed the corresponding cash payments. The lease agreement permits Pinal County to terminate the lease if Jet Yard fails to make substantial progress toward the construction of facilities on the leased premises in phases in accordance with a specified timetable, which includes, as the initial phase, the construction of a demolition pad to be completed by March 2017 and, as the final and most significant phase, the construction of an aircraft maintenance hangar large enough to house a Boeing B777-300 by the first quarter of 2021. The construction of the demolition pad specified under the lease has not been completed, and Jet Yard and Pinal County are in discussions with respect to improvements on the leased premises. As of the date of issuance, the Company was informed that the Pinal County is working on the rezoning of Pinal Airpark, which prevents any tenant from construction on the Airpark.

AirCo operates at a 20,000 square-foot facility leased from the shareholder of the AirCo Seller. The lease duration is one year with an option for AirCo to extend the lease up to four additional one-year periods at the same terms. The lease provides that AirCo may terminate the lease on 90 days’ notice during the first year. Customers of AirCo include airlines and commercial aircraft leasing companies.
 
Leasing.
 
The Company organized ATGL on October 6, 2015. ATGL provides funding for equipment leasing transactions, which may include transactions for the leasing of equipment manufactured by GGS and Delphax and transactions initiated by third parties unrelated to equipment manufactured by the Company.
Backlog.
 
GGS’s backlog consists of “firm” orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment sold by GGS. At March 31, 2018, GGS’s backlog of orders was $13.3 million, all of which GGS expects to be filled in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2017, GGS’s backlog of orders was $2.8 million. Backlog is not meaningful for the Company’s other business segments.

Research and Development.
 
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, Delphax incurred research and development expenses of $196,000 and $1,042,000, respectively. Research and development expense incurred by Delphax relates to the development of its elan® 500 digital color print system.
 
Governmental Regulation.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies.
 
The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has the authority to regulate air service. The DOT has authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, and may, in certain circumstances, assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions.
 
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires MAC and CSA to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.
 
The FAA has safety jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including flight equipment, flight and ground personnel training, examination and certification, certain ground facilities, flight equipment maintenance programs and procedures, examination and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic control and communications and other matters. The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of flight operations generally, including equipment used, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds all operating airworthiness and other FAA certificates that are currently required for the conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked for cause. The FAA periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA’s operating procedures and flight and maintenance records.
 
In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including MAC and CSA, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carriers from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.
 
The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. The aircraft operated by the Company are in compliance with all such regulations promulgated by the FAA. Moreover, because the Company does not operate jet aircraft, noncompliance is not likely. Aircraft operated by us also comply with standards for aircraft exhaust emissions promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended.
 
Jet Yard and AirCo operate repair stations licensed under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications must be renewed annually, or in certain circumstances within 24 months. Certified repair stations are subject to periodic FAA inspection and audit. The repair station may not be relocated without written approval from the FAA.
 
Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

Maintenance and Insurance.
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is required to maintain the aircraft it operates under the appropriate FAA and manufacturer standards and regulations.
 
The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance in excess of minimum amounts required by the United States Department of Transportation.
 
The Company maintains cargo liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance for owned and leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance with respect to injuries and loss arising from use of products sold and services provided.
 
In March 2014, the Company formed Space Age Insurance Company (“SAIC”), a captive insurance company licensed in Utah. SAIC insures risks of the Company and its subsidiaries that were not previously insured by the various Company insurance programs (including the risk of loss of key customers and contacts, administrative actions and regulatory changes); and may from time to time underwrite third-party risk through certain reinsurance arrangements. SAIC is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Employees.
 
At March 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had 775 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees. None of the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are represented by labor unions. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.
