Item 1. Description of Business.
 
Himalaya Technologies, Inc. a/k/a Homeland Resources Ltd. (“Himalaya”, “HMLA,” “us,” “we,” the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Company’s principal historical activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, the Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude oil and natural gas properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2019. Over the past few years, the company generated approximately $1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to July 31, 2022 the Company reached an agreement with the prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder. Our intended plan of operations is to develop and enhance our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness in the cannabis media market supplemented by strategic acquisitions and investments in GenBio, Inc. and other potential to be determined opportunities. On June 28, 2021 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Himalaya Technologies, Inc. from Homeland Resources Ltd.
 
Our business plan includes completing our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness focused on the cannabis market, generating revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing our planned 19.9% investment GenBio, Inc.’s health and wellness products targeting anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals to consumers. In the future, in partnership with GenBio, Inc., we plan to introduce a health and wellness energy and anti-inflammatory beverage product under the brand “FOMO” or other to drive growth. We are currently in preliminary discussions with co-pack and distribution companies, and GenBio, Inc. is formulating its extracts and obtaining laboratory certification for this planned consumer beverage, though there can be no assurance of a successful product formulation or distribution.
 
The Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP. The Company has two investments, GenBio, Inc. and The Agrarian Group, LLC. The Company owns 19.9% of GenBio, Inc. and 19.9% of The Agrarian Group, LLC.
 
KANAB CORP. is a development stage company targeting information services for the cannabis industry using its social site Kanab.Club (https://kanab.club/). We do not offer e-commerce services at this time or touch the cannabis plant and, given these matters, do not believe regulatory oversight or rules of law are a risk factor to our business.
 
On November 28, 2021 we executed a 19.9% stock purchase with GenBio, Inc. (“GenBio”; https://www.genbioinc.com/) a provider of nutraceutical products and services based on proprietary biotechnology that fight inflammation and high blood pressure. We issued 99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9% ownership. Based on a stock price at closing of .0019 and 99,685,794 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $189,749. The GenBio transaction is being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate GenBio’s financial statements.
 
On January 1, 2022, the Company executed a 19.9% stock purchase with The Agrarian Group LLC (“TAG”; http://www.theagrariangroup.com/), a provider of digital intelligence “AgtechDi” software designed from its granted patents to optimize the food supply chain by increasing food safety and profitability for growers who operate vertical farms, greenhouses, converted shipping containers, and other forms of controlled environment agriculture. TAG is focusing its technology on the broad produce market, but in the future may offer it to cannabis cultivators. TAG is a software platform and will never touch the cannabis plant, eliminating regulatory risk, in our view. Under the Investment Agreement, we issued TAG 99,686 Series B Preferred shares in exchange for 1,242,000 Class A Membership units of TAG. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,868,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $119,841. The TAG transaction is being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate TAG’s financial statements.

The Company’s shareholder voting control is effectively controlled by its chairman and CEO, Vikram P.
