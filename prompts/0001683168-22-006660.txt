ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Business
 
iPower Inc. (formerly BZRTH, Inc.), a California-based corporation, was formed in Nevada in April 2018. We own and operate the retail website www.zenhydro.com where we sell a wide array of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) and multiple best-selling products which enable our customers to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers, and other plants, including cannabis. We believe we are one of the largest online hydroponic equipment suppliers in the United States. The U.S. hydroponic and gardening industry is generally fragmented, and retail outlets are often smaller family-owned enterprises consisting of a single location. We intend to take advantage of current market conditions by providing consumers with a one-stop shopping experience where they can satisfy all of their horticultural needs and have the products shipped directly to them. We have also leveraged our product development, merchandising and ecommerce expertise to extend our product catalog to address the broader general gardening and home goods market. The company is also developing a suite of ecommerce services to enable companies and brands to penetrate global markets more effectively.
 
The Company leases approximately 220,000 square feet of floor space across our four fulfillment centers just outside of Los Angeles, California and in Rancho Cucamonga, California. We have fostered relationships with recognized commercial shipping enterprises. From our four fulfillment centers, we deliver directly to customers including homes, farms and small commercial cultivators, as well as various commercial hydroponics stores across the United States.
 
In addition to iPower’s website, www.zenhydro.com, we sell our products through third party e-commerce channels including Amazon, eBay and Walmart.com, where we have worked to develop a strong presence on their platforms. Approximately 90% of our sales revenue during the year ended June 30, 2022 were derived from sales on Amazon, eBay and Walmart, where we experienced approximately 47% revenue growth in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year.
 
Products
 
iPower offers essential supplies to the hydroponic, gardening and home goods industry, including nutrients, industry-leading hydroponic equipment, power-efficient lighting, and thousands of additional products for home users and professional growers. In addition to offering products from hundreds of third-party brands, the Company has established its own in-house branded products which are also made available for purchase through our various sales channels. Our in-house branded products, marketed under the iPower™ and Simple Deluxe™ brands, include grow-light systems, ventilation systems, activated carbon filters, nutrients, growing media, hydroponic water-resistant grow tents, trimming machines, pumps and many more hydroponic-related items, some of which have been designated as Amazon best seller product leaders, including products which have been designated “Amazon Choice Products” and “#1 Best Seller SKUs.” We currently offer more than 4,000 products from our proprietary, in-house branded products to consumers. This year, our in-house catalog has expanded to include more general home goods products including floor fans, wall fans, shelving units, chairs and other items that are extensions of our hydroponic product catalog.
 
Specifically for the hydroponics market, we own and operate the retail website www.zenhydro.com where we sell a wide array of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) and multiple best-selling products which enable our customers to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers, and other plants, including cannabis.

Our Industry is Large and Rapidly Growing
 
Our principal industry opportunity is in the retail sale and distribution of hydroponics equipment and supplies, general gardening supplies, and home goods. Hydroponics supplies generally include grow light systems; advanced heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems; humidity and carbon dioxide monitors and controllers; water pumps, heaters, chillers and filters; nutrient and fertilizer delivery systems; and various growing media typically made from soil, rock wool or coconut fiber, among others. General gardening supplies generally include environmental sensors and controls and nutrients among others. Home goods supplies currently include commercial fans, floor and wall fans, storage and shelving units, and chairs among others. 
 
Hydroponic systems constitute an increasingly significant and fast-growing component of the expansive global commercial agriculture and consumer gardening sectors. According to the USDA and National Gardening Survey, the agriculture, food, and related industry sector produced more than $1 trillion worth of goods in the U.S. alone in 2017. According to Statista, the market for garden supplies and equipment surpassed $100 billion in 2020, and is expected to reach $130 billion by 2024.
 
According to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global industry for hydroponic systems is currently valued at approximately $12.1 billion and is projected to reach $25.1 billion by 2027. In addition, according to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global hydroponics crops market is estimated to be valued at approximately $37.7 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $53.4 billion by 2028, recording a CAGR of 7.2%. The rapid growth of hydroponics-related crop output will subsequently drive growth in the wholesale hydroponics equipment and supplies industry.
 
The home goods industry has become a significant category we sell into. Grandview Research estimated that the size of the home goods market in the US was $740 billion in 2020 and should reach close to $1,040 billion by 2024, with a CAGR of 7.4%.
 
Increased Focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Issues
 
We believe the growth and change in our end-markets is in part driven by a variety of ESG trends aimed at preserving resources and enhancing the transparency and safety of our food supply chains. It has been reported by McKinsey & Company that approximately 66% of consumers – and 75% of millennial consumers – consider sustainability when making purchases. (See Business News Daily, “Most Consumers Want Sustainable Products and Packaging” (August 5, 2022)). Overall, hydroponic growing systems deliver superior performance characteristics versus traditional agriculture when compared on select key ESG performance criteria:
 

· | More efficient land usage. Hydroponics systems allow for greater crop production per square foot, reducing the amount of land needed to grow crops. Certain types of vertical farming are up to 20 times more productive than traditional farming per acre. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | More efficient fresh water usage. Hydroponics systems allow for the management and recycling of water inside of a closed-loop system and therefore generally require less water than traditional outdoor agriculture. In certain instances, hydroponics systems can grow plants with up to 98% less water than soil-based agriculture. 
· | Decreased use of fertilizer and pesticides. As hydroponics takes place in a controlled, often indoor environment, the need for pesticides application is reduced, allowing growers to apply less pesticide with more precise application compared to traditional outdoor agriculture. 
· | Reduced carbon emissions. Hydroponics, especially vertical farming, allows large farming operations to be located significantly closer to end-users, thereby reducing the transportation distance of ready-to-use crops. 
· | Reduced food waste. Similar to the above, since hydroponics growing systems allow for food production significantly closer to the end-user, there is less time between production and consumption and therefore reduced product spoilage, damage and waste. 
· | Chemical runoff prevention. Due to the closed-loop nature of hydroponics systems, such systems significantly decrease the risk of chemical runoff, which is generally more difficult to control in traditional outdoor agriculture. 
· | Supports organic farming. Hydroponics is well suited for organic farming, the produce of which has been in increasing demand by consumers. 

Research and Development
 
The Company has not incurred any significant research and development (“R&D”) expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. We do most of our development work in conjunction with our manufacturing partners, where we co-engineer designs with their development teams. We plan to increase our investments in R&D relating to the improvement of existing products and the development and addition of new product lines.

Customers and Suppliers
 
We have a diverse customer base, with residential gardeners and hobbyists constituting a significant portion of our customer base and thus the largest segment of our total sales. We sell to both commercial and home cultivators growing specialty crops. At present, sales to customers through Amazon and other third-party online platforms accounts for more than 90% of our annual sales.
 
We do not manufacture any of the hydroponic products we sell through our distribution channels. We purchase our products from more than 100 suppliers, including manufacturers and distributors in the US and China. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, one supplier accounted for 18% and three suppliers accounted for 38% (18%, 10% and 10%) of the Company's total purchases, respectively. We do not have any long-term supply agreements.
 
Manufacturers
 
We obtain both our branded proprietary products and distributed products from third party suppliers. Most of the products purchased and resold, whether our proprietary products or third-party products we sell through our platform, are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens and plant-based products. Our products are sourced from more than 100 different suppliers and manufacturers, with approximately 84% sourced from China. Quality control is a critical priority for our team charged with ensuring the supply of the products from our suppliers, specifically those coming from China. We seek to ensure the highest level of quality control for our products through routine factory visits, spot testing and continual, ongoing supplier due diligence.
 
Our distributed products are sourced from more than 100 suppliers. Our experienced internal sourcing team is charged with maintaining strong relationships with current suppliers, while also constantly tracking current and future market trends and reviewing offerings of new suppliers.
 
We do not have exclusive purchase agreements with many of our suppliers. Based on our knowledge and communication with our suppliers, we believe some of our suppliers may sell directly to the retail market or to our wholesale customers. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Business.”
 
Demand for Products
 
Demand for indoor and outdoor growing equipment is currently high due to the legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis, which is mainly due to equipment purchases for build-out and repeat purchases of consumable nutrients needed during the growing period. This demand is projected to continue to grow as additional states adopt legislation supporting the sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis-related products. Continued innovation and more efficient build-out of technologies along with larger and consolidated and combined cultivation facilities is expected to further expand market demand for iPower products and services, including our in-house branded products. We expect the market to continue to segment into urban farmers serving groups of individuals, community cultivators, and small- and large-scale commercial cultivation facilities across the states. We are of the opinion that as our volume increases, we will obtain volume discounts on purchasing that should allow us to maximize both our revenues and gross margins. In addition, the vertical farming market is increasing year over year, where it is projected to grow from $3.98 billion in 2020 to $21.15 billion in 2028, representing a 23.6% compound annual growth rate.

E-Commerce Strategy
 
The Company continues to grow and develop its e-commerce platform, www.zenhydro.com., where we sell hydroponic products, including equipment, tools, nutrients and more. In addition to our website, we offer products to consumers through established e-commerce channels such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart. Through these portals we offer various hydroponic, specialty and organic gardening products for sale. Online shoppers can have the ability to peruse our various product departments, from nutrients to lighting to hydroponic and greenhouse equipment, providing consumers with an easy and quick method to find the exact products they need. In addition to these sections, our webstore frequently offers customers flash deals, best value recommendations and clearance sale items. Our e-commerce site has been designed to appeal to both the professional grower, as well as the home gardener/hobbyist. Each product listed on the site contains product descriptions, product reviews and a picture so the consumer can make an informed and educated purchase. Our product filters allow the consumer to search by brand, manufacturer, or by price. Consumers can shop online day and night and have their purchases shipped directly to the location of their choice, or simply elect to use our website as a resource. Google advertising, social media advertising and email list marketing, in addition to auto-ship functionality, are the primary mechanisms we employ to drive traffic to www.zenhydro.com and the other portals through which we make our products available for sale, including Amazon.com, eBay and Walmart. At present, more than 50% of our total sales occur through Amazon.com.
 
Large Established Distribution Infrastructure
 
We have a fully developed distribution network through our three distribution centers in California. We work with a network of third-party common carrier trucking/freight companies that service our customers throughout the U.S., Canada and across the globe. We receive daily customer orders via our business-to-business e-commerce platform. Orders are then routed to the applicable distribution center and packed for shipments. Most of our customer orders are shipped within one business day of order receipt.
Competition
 
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive and fragmented. Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, as well as other online product resellers on large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay. Our industry is highly fragmented with more than 1,000 retail outlets throughout the U.S. We compete with companies that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. Our competitors could also introduce new hydroponic growing equipment, and as manufacturers are able to sell equipment directly to consumers, our distributors could cease selling products to us.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that our pricing, inventory and product availability, and overall customer service provide us with the ability to compete in this marketplace. We believe that we have the following core competitive advantages over our competitors:
 

· | In addition to our in-house branded products, we distribute products from hundreds of third-party brands, ensuring that whatever a customer’s particular need may be, they need look no further than iPower for their gardening needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our knowledgeable and experienced sales team can provide guidance and insights, whether dealing with a seasoned commercial entity or a first-time purchaser looking to get their grow operations off the ground. 
· | The convenience of our e-commerce platform allows customers to shop from the comfort of their own home and have their purchases shipped directly to them. 
· | We offer top-to-bottom solutions, from custom build-outs to nutrients in order to ensure that their grow operations flourish and provide significant yields. 
· | We view ourselves as an industry leader, offering products and new technologies from the largest and most trusted names in the business, as well as our own in-house branded products. 

 
Moreover, we expect that as we continue to grow our business, we will achieve an economy of scale, and as such, will be able to make larger inventory purchases at lower volume sale prices, which will enable us to continue to maintain competitive pricing options and deliver the array of items that our customers require. Through supply chain and industry competency, support services, and our relationships with suppliers, distributors, vendors and logistics partners, we believe we can maintain and increase our growth trajectory.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our intellectual property primarily consists of our brands and their related trademarks, domain names, websites, customer lists and affiliations, as well as our marketing intangibles, product know-how and technology. We also hold rights to website addresses related to our business, including websites that are actively used in our daily business operations, such as www.Zenhydro.com. We own federally registered trademarks for “iPower” and “Simple Deluxe,” which correspond to our current in-house branded products.
Government Regulation
 
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments.
 
In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and a total of 44 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have adopted frameworks, in varying forms, that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, as well as hemp and CBD, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. In addition, with the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. While we do not know the percentage or actual usage of our products for purposes of growing cannabis or hemp-derived products, for those users who intend to use the Company’s products to grow hemp-derived CBD medicinal products, the 2018 Farm Bill officially removed hemp from the list of controlled substances. While we note that the 2018 Farm Bill has not changed the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration as concerns cannabis and cannabis-derived products, and that such products continue to remain subject to the same regulatory requirements as FDA-regulated products, we nonetheless believe the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities.
 
Our gardening products, including our hydroponic gardening products, are multi-purpose products designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp. Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business. The changing laws may cause us to experience additional capital expenditures as we adapt our business to meet the requirements of the evolving legal and regulatory landscape.
 
As we believe certain unknown number of our end users are in the business of growing cannabis, we believe we have benefited from the nationwide efforts to legalize marijuana at the state level. To date, a total of 44 states plus the District of Columbia (“D.C.”) have legalized cannabis in one form or another, with 15 states plus D.C. have legalizing marijuana for adult use, including both medicinal and recreational, 20 states having legalized marijuana for medical purposes only, and 12 states have legalized the use of CBD oil (a concentrated form of hemp extract) only. According to the 2019 US Cannabis Cultivation Report published by New Frontier Data, United States cultivation output is expected to grow from 29.8 million pounds in 2019 to 34.4 million pounds by 2025. According mjbizdaily.com, the U.S. retail cannabis industry grew to a record $27 billion in sales in 2021, is expected to hit $33 billion in 2022, with expected annual sales of $52.6 billion by 2026. (See https://mjbizdaily.com/us-cannabis-sales-estimates/).We intend to leverage the growth of cannabis and CBD products, in tandem with its increased legalization, to further build our brand and promote our hydroponics equipment and products within the cannabis community.
 
We believe that the growth in licensed cannabis cultivation facilities and the increase in organically grown produce will increase the general demand for hydroponics products. Further, we believe our dedication to providing consumers with innovative and cutting-edge products tailored to their individual needs, combined with our industry knowledge and customer service, has positioned iPower to take advantage of the domestic and international growth anticipated for hydroponic products.
