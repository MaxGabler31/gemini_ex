ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles. Our primary focus is to provide sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. We design and manufacture all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes the way these vehicles operate. We are focused on our core competency of bringing our electric delivery vehicle platforms to market.
Automotive
We are an American-based Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), and our products are marketed under the Workhorse® brand. All Workhorse last-mile delivery trucks are assembled in our Union City, Indiana production facility. 
We believe our all-electric commercial vehicles offer fleet operators significant benefits, which include:
•Lower total cost-of-ownership as compared to conventional gas/diesel vehicles;
•Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses;
•Increased package deliveries per day through use of more efficient delivery methods;
•Decreased vehicle emissions and reduction in carbon footprint; and
•Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.
Electric Delivery Truck Platforms
Product Roadmap
Workhorse has developed a revised strategic product roadmap for our electric vehicle delivery offerings. The foundation of this plan is the development of two new truck chassis platforms, the W56 and W34. The W56, based on long-standing Company know-how in the Class 5 and 6 truck chassis market, is expected to begin production in 2023. The W34 platform will be our second generation, low floor, advanced content offering for the Class 3 and 4 truck chassis market and is expected to begin production in 2024.
In order to accelerate time-to-market for customers seeking delivery of electric vehicles during 2022, we entered into a strategic supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with GreenPower Motor Company Inc. (“GreenPower”). Under the agreement, we will have exclusive rights to sell Class 4 step vans based on the GreenPower supplied base vehicle. The finished Class 4 step vans will be available for sale in the United States and Canada, under the Workhorse brand and with Workhorse after sales and support service. The van, known as the W750, will have approximately 750 cubic foot capacity and will feature up to 150 miles of all-electric range, with a payload capacity of five thousand pounds. We expect the first deliveries of the W750 will occur later in 2022.
C-Series Electric Delivery Truck
We announced the development of the C-Series electric delivery truck in 2017, a vehicle aimed at the Class 3 truck market which leverages an ultra-low floor delivery vehicle platform. We utilized our extensive customer experience gained from working with our E-Series customers to design this product. In September 2021, we announced a number of enhancements to the design of the C-1000 to address customer feedback, primarily related to vehicle dynamics that increase the vehicles’ payload capacity. As part of these efforts, we suspended deliveries and recalled all of the C-1000 vehicles due to additional testing and modifications required to certify the C-1000 vehicles under FMVSS. In connection with the recall, we agreed to refund our customers for the purchase price of the C-1000 vehicles previously delivered.
The certification and testing process was completed in February 2022. Upon completion of this review, the C-1000 platform was determined to be eligible for certification and reintroduction as a limited production vehicle with constrained cargo capacity. Accordingly, we do not plan to focus our manufacturing efforts on the C-1000 in the future. Instead, we expect to transition our manufacturing focus to the W56 and W34 platforms in the near future. 
Further modifications to the vehicle will be made during the required FMVSS rework process, including a redesigned front suspension as well as supplier corrective actions related to certain components. The entire fleet of currently manufactured 
C-1000’s will have the required corrective actions applied during 2022. We intend to repair and resell the majority of the returned vehicles to the original customers.
E-Series Electric Delivery Vans
Workhorse E-100 battery-electric and E-GEN range-extended delivery vans are used by our customers on daily routes across the United States. We have built and delivered approximately 360 electric and range-extended medium-duty delivery trucks to our customers with a combined mileage total of more than 8 million miles. Our customers include companies such as Alpha Baking, FedEx Express, Ryder, the United Parcel Service, and W.B. Mason.
Aerospace
HorseFly™
As part of our growing technology portfolio, the Company has been developing small Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) for several years. We hold, or have filed for, patents on several elements of UAS intellectual property. 
Our HorseFly UAS includes a custom-designed, purpose-built, all-electric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (“UAV”), a proprietary Ground Control Station (“GCS”), and equipment that supports integrating the UAS with our delivery trucks and other applications. The HorseFly UAV is an airborne work truck, that can carry a significant payload for 10 miles. Our rugged components are designed to support the high volumes, long duty days and ease of maintenance demanded by the commercial package delivery industry. 
In 2020, Workhorse began the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Type Certification (“TC”) process for our Horsefly UAS. Compliance with FAA regulations governing TC helps set a very high bar for system performance and we believe it is important to have a TC system in our product offerings. Safety, reliability and capability are the primary points of value in a commercial UAS. Presently, the FAA allows some exceptions for commercial operations to use non-certificated drone systems. As the industry matures, we expect the FAA will require certificated aircraft in most commercial operations.
We have developed subsystems and many discrete functions to improve the safety, reliability and performance of our systems. One subsystem is a proprietary winch that can lower and raise significant payloads from safe altitudes. Another is a truck integration system that allows continuous operations from a truck in the field. Our GCS software allows Remote Pilots in Command to control more than one aircraft simultaneously. 
Workhorse was granted a patent on our UAS, and though initially designed as a complimentary system delivering packages from our electric trucks, the latest iteration of our UAS supports package delivery point-to-point, enabling deliveries to and from anywhere, allowing it to serve a broader customer base. As part of the divestiture of SureFly™ Multicopter, the Company formed a 50/50 joint venture to which we contributed our HorseFly technology.
In tests and demonstrations, Workhorse has flown thousands of missions in the National Airspace System, demonstrating package deliveries for large multi-national companies in Ohio, Michigan, Florida and California. Our aircraft has proven to be safe, reliable, and capable. In addition, we have successfully demonstrated the drone’s enhanced functionality working with local, state and federal government agencies to validate other, new cases. For example, in January 2022 we received a grant from the US Department of Agriculture in support of enhanced mapping and data analysis of farmland in underserved communities in the State of Mississippi.
Locations and Facilities
Our company headquarters, research and development facilities and warehouse are located in the Greater Cincinnati area in Ohio. We manufacture and test our electric delivery trucks at our manufacturing facility located in Union City, Indiana. We plan to open an engineering and technical design center in Wixom, Michigan during 2022.
Marketing
There are over 350,000 last-mile delivery trucks replaced annually and is the fastest growing vehicle market in an $18.0 billion market space. Our sales team is focused on building our market share in this space by targeting commercial transportation companies and developing a dealer network through our relationships with Mitsubishi, Ryder and Pritchard Companies (“Pritchard)”.
We have established the commercial delivery vehicles as our core business and intend to be the best choice for a vehicle in this segment. Our sales plan is to meet with the top potential customers and obtain purchase orders for new electric vehicles to be manufactured in our production facility.
Strategic Relationships 
GreenPower Motor Company Inc.: On February 28, 2022, Workhorse entered into a strategic vehicle purchase and supply agreement with GreenPower Motor Company, Inc. to purchase base vehicles in the Class 4, medium-duty vehicle class. The term of the agreement is two years and will provide Workhorse with base vehicles for completion at our Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility. Workhorse will begin accepting deliveries of the base vehicles in the second half of 2022. Workhorse has exclusive rights to sell step vans using the base vehicle in the United States and Canada.
Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc: Mitsubishi (formerly Hitachi Capital America) continues to be our primary financing partner to market and distribute our electric vehicles through an existing and well-established commercial vehicle dealer network throughout North America. Mitsubishi enables Workhorse to have our vehicles sold and financed from the moment they roll off the production line, into a shared pool of vehicles, where they become visible and available to every Mitsubishi connected dealer. The dealer can configure additional equipment, schedule upfit integration and delivery in a seamless manner. Other strategic relationships come into play here, such as Pritchard, which supports installation of the requested upfits and transportation of those vehicles from Workhorse manufacturing in Union City, IN, to upfit install locations and then to the final delivery site.
Amerit Fleet Solutions (“Amerit”): Workhorse has signed a strategic agreement with Amerit to provide maintenance and repair services for Workhorse vehicles, utilizing their mobile maintenance units and technicians. This provides Workhorse with on ground maintenance and warranty service capabilities in a great majority of locations across the United States.
Ryder System, Inc: The Company has an agreement with Ryder to serve as a distributor. Under the agreement, Ryder also has the ability to be a provider of certain repair services and distributor of certain vehicle parts in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Moog Inc: The Company and Moog entered into a joint venture agreement for the development of the Company's Horsefly truck based electrically powered unmanned aerial systems (the “Horsefly Assets”) and the related business (the “Horsefly Agreement”). Under the Horsefly Agreement, the Company contributed the Horsefly Assets and Moog contributed certain complementary assets to Certus Unmanned Aerial Systems LLC, (“Certus”) that is 50% owned by both the Company and Moog. Certus will license the Horsefly Assets to the Company and Moog so that each party may use the Horsefly Assets in their respective businesses. Through Certus, teams from Workhorse and Moog are improving HorseFly’s components and sub-systems with the goal of bringing the highest quality, most capable UAS to market. We believe combining the capabilities of the two companies brings significant value to the UAS marketplace, particularly in the area of high-reliability, safety-sensitive, certificated systems that require the highest levels of government approval for operations.
Technology, Research and Development
The majority of our research and development is conducted in-house at our facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio and is centered on drive train, telematics and related electric vehicle (“EV”) centric feature sets. During 2022, we plan to expand our research and development footprint to include the addition of new staff in Wixom, MI. The Wixom facility is intended to focus additional resources for product development and validation activities for existing and future programs. Additionally, we contract with engineering firms to assist with validation and certification requirements as well as specific development and vehicle integration tasks. Our research and development activity over the past year has focused on the development of the W56 and the W34 platforms. Additionally, we focused on enhancements and required improvements for the C-1000 product line, including corrective action needed to support production assembly efficiency, material component availability, cost reduction and customer feedback. 
Metron / Metron - Air
We continue to develop our Metron remote data management system that tracks the performance of all the vehicles we deploy. We are currently focused on adding the ability to integrate Metron Telematics with the internal telematics and data management systems of our clients, as well as expanding our ability to present and manipulate data within a proprietary Workhorse interface.
Competition
Traditional OEMs
Most, if not all, traditional OEM's have made announcements about their electrification efforts, which have primarily been highly focused on consumer-based vehicles. In 2021, due in part to a shift in consumer behavior stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increased focus on the commercial space. To date, plans have primarily been focused on lighter and smaller last mile vehicles, such as Ford with their Transit Connect and larger Transit models, and General Motors with their recent unveiling of the Brightdrop company and EV600 product. All of these vehicles have 600 cubic foot or less of cargo capacity. In contrast, Workhorse is focused on the 650 - 1200 cubic foot category. Our market research and direct customer engagements have helped us provide value to some of the largest and most efficient last mile delivery companies in North America, through deployment of our E-Series, which was produced until 2018. Current competition in this segment from traditional chassis manufacturers include a recently released EV strip chassis product from Freightliner Custom Chassis, integrated with components from third party suppliers.
Non-Traditional OEMs
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid global shift towards home delivery, with many companies seeking to provide delivery solutions aimed at a sub-600 cubic foot cargo area. It is our expectation that these non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford. We believe one of the main reasons for this race towards smaller vehicles is to provide a sub-10,000 pound gross vehicle weight (“GVW”) offering, as vehicles above 10,000 pound GVW require a more expensive, commercially licensed and trained driver pool.
Regulatory
Our electric vehicles are designed to comply with required government regulations and industry standards. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our business.
Emission and fuel economy standards
Government regulation related to climate change is in effect at the U.S. federal and state levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which is applicable for model years 2018 through 2020. EPA and NHTSA also issued a final rule on August 16, 2016 increasing the stringency of these standards for model years 2021 through 2027.
The rules provide emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors; (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe Workhorse vehicles would be considered “vocational vehicles” and “heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans” under the rules. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse vehicles, including an engine Averaging, Banking and Trading (“ABT”) program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements more than the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity (“CoC”) issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) requires we obtain a CoC with respect to emissions and mileage requirements for our vehicles. Workhorse received its CoC from the EPA for both model year (“MY”) 2020 and MY2021 C-Series. The CoC is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The 
California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. Workhorse received Executive Order A-445-0003 for MY2020 vehicles and Executive Order A-445-0004 for MY2021 vehicles.
Vehicle safety and testing
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) substantially regulates our aerospace vehicles. Those regulations govern two important areas: operating rules and aircraft certification rules. The FAA’s operating rules govern all operations of all aerial vehicles in the National Airspace System of the United States. The FAA’s certification rules help define the safety and reliability requirements of certain aircraft and systems. Not every aircraft and system are required to be FAA certificated, though typically certification is required for commercial operations like package delivery. 
Workhorse is applying for FAA Type Certification for its small unmanned aerial system. We believe it is important to achieve FAA certification of our products. Though we believe our design and execution comply with FAA requirements for certification, should we or the FAA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exist with respect to our aircraft or its systems, it could add substantially to the time and expense of certification. Should the FAA change its rules for either certification or operations, it could render our designs non-competitive in the marketplace.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants. We seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-how, and engineering skills make a vital contribution to our business, and we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
We are not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of our trademarks that could materially affect our business. It is our policy to pursue registration of our primary trademarks whenever possible and to vigorously defend our patents, trademarks and other proprietary marks against infringement or other threats to the extent practical under applicable laws.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)
Workhorse’s mission is based on the foundation of the commercial vehicle transition to zero emissions. To do this, we embrace a world with reduced carbon emissions in both energy generation and consumption. We are designing and manufacturing a key ingredient of the transportation ecosystem evolution to achieve this goal - last mile electric delivery vehicles. 
We are investing to make our factory more efficient and sustainably designed and are also driving a continuous safety mindset by focusing on worker engagement. In addition, we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint throughout our supply chain. We are committed to sourcing responsibly produced materials from suppliers who have social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations.
Finally, we believe that sound corporate governance is essential to helping us achieve our goal, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company. During 2022, we will create our first ESG Council, made up of leaders from across our company, and they will begin regular presentations on our related initiatives to our Board of Directors, which guides our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, our full-time headcount for our employees was 221. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We understand that our innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in our space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy.
Governance. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters. The Compensation Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including compensation and benefit programs. Our collective recommendations to the Board of Directors and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that aligns with our core values.
Our management team administers all employment matters, such as recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation and rewards, performance management and professional development. We continuously evaluate and enhance our internal policies, process and practices to increase employee engagement and productivity.
Support Employee Well-being and Engagement. We support the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial, and social perspective. Our well-being program includes a long-standing practice of flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance programs.
Offer Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefits offerings, tying incentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering competitive maternal/paternal leave policies, providing meaningful retirement and health benefits, and maintaining an employee stock incentive plan. 
Promote Sense of Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our values and spot awards to recognize employee contributions. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. We conduct annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager and also conducts a self-assessment, a process which empowers our employees. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of objectives specific to the employee’s department or role.
Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training, and education, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company and management and leadership development programs.
Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The health and safety of our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace around the world is of paramount importance to Workhorse. We have remained open throughout COVID-19, but we have allowed employees at certain points during the pandemic to work from home. Additionally, in order to maximize the health and safety of our workforce, we provided periodic communication from senior leaders regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the workforce and the Company while initiating new safety protocols across all sites.
