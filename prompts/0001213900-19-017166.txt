ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company Background
 
We are engaged in marketing self-owned brand and wholesaling of spirits and wines in China through our operating subsidiary, Fenyang Huanxin Wine Industry Development Co., Ltd. (“Huaxin”) and Fujian Jin’ou Trading Co., Ltd. (“Jin’ou”). We maintain our principal executive offices at One Liberty Plaza, Suite 2310 PMB# 21, New York, NY 10006, United States. Our telephone number is (646) 759-3614.
 


We run a growing alcohol marketing self-owned brand and wholesale business guided by a core purpose: to promote premium alcoholic beverages to China’s population. We currently focus our business on the sale of Chinese Fenjiu liquor and imported wines. We aim to achieve this purpose by catering to the ever-evolving customer tastes in alcohols through our creative marketing strategies and innovative product designs that target different age groups of China’s population. To that end, we have hired marketing talents who have decades of experience in effective alcohol brand building. As a result, we believe we have managed to respond to the demand for Chinese Fenjiu liquor and imported wines in the Chinese marketplace.

We believe that Fenjiu liquor presents great business opportunities for us to utilize creative product designs and marketing strategies to attract Chinese consumers. Collaborating with Fenjiu Group, the sole producer of Fenjiu liquor in China, we have been focusing on product design to convey a modern feel to our Fenjiu products while maintaining Fenjiu liquor’s historical elegance. We believe our designer packaging, symbolized by its bright coloring and prominently fat-bellied jars, stands out from those of our competitors. With creative designs and stylized names, our registered trademarks, such as Dagangjiu (translated as “Big Jar Liquor”), are effective in capturing the attention of Chinese consumers, young and old.
 
Established in October 2016, we believe our imported wine distribution business has high growth potential as evidenced from the market prices of the imported wines from Spain and New Zealand, the two countries where we import most of our wine products from, in the current Chinese market. A great majority of our competitors have priced their 750mL bottles of wine imported from Spain and New Zealand well above RMB 200. This price falls within the premium range in the general Chinese wine market. Within the general Chinese wine market, the premium range enjoyed the highest year-on-year growth compared to other price tiers of wine in 2018. This pricing trend for premium wines is applicable to imported wines from Spain and New Zealand, which we believe will benefit our growth in 2019. Accordingly, our strategy is to continue pricing our imported wine products within the premium range levels to generate higher margins. Though marketing and branding are still integral parts of the wine business in China, wine sales are highly driven by the origin of the wines. Since Spain and New Zealand are considered prime origins for wine productions, we believe that our imported wine products will continue to attract the attention of Chinese consumers and promote the sustainable growth of our imported wine business.
 
We believe that effective marketing strategies and creative product designs are two major contributing factors to our success. To improve and maintain the effectiveness of our marketing strategies, we have established integrated and collaborative processes to drive coordinated operations across our marketing efforts and sales. Our marketing strategies enable us to promote multiple sales concepts across two major alcohol categories, effectively attracting different age and cultural groups of the Chinese population. Our marketing plans are tailored to meet the evolving taste and demands of Chinese consumers. As a result, we believe that the Company’s innovative and highly-customized designs draw considerable public attention, which in turns is a contributing factor to the volume of our sales.
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenue of approximately 97% from Fenjiu liquor wholesale and approximately 3% from imported wine wholesale. For the year ended June 30, 2018, we generated revenue of approximately 84.9% from Fenjiu liquor wholesale and approximately 15.1% from imported wine wholesale. We have not experienced any seasonality in our business. 
 
Industry Overview
 
Chinese Fenjiu Liquor Market
 
We believe that the long-term demand for Chinese hard liquor, especially Fenjiu liquor, will continue to grow in China. The overall business environment has been optimistic, due to the continuous economic growth evidenced by the significant growth of Chinese nominal gross domestic product (“GDP”). This has led to an ever-increasing growth in China’s per capita expenditures on food, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages, indicating increased consumers’ disposable income and willingness to spend money on alcoholic beverages in general. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the sales volumes of Chinese liquor in China has remained relatively flat between 2012 and 2016. Given the increasing purchasing power and improving living standards, the sales volume of Chinese liquor increased from 11,267.0 million liters in 2012 to 13,057.1 million liters in 2016, with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.8%. Overall, we believe consumers are increasingly interested in drinking better quality liquor. We expect that with the Chinese consumers’ increasing purchasing power the consumption of Chinese liquor will shift to higher quality products and therefore the Chinese liquor market is expected to experience growth in the near future. According to the China Insights Consultancy (“CIC”) report, there are approximately 1,578 Chinese liquor producers in China with annual revenue above RMB 20 million in 2016. These producers are mainly located in the southwest, northeast and central China. Given the Chinese government’s implementation of policies designed to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, namely overseas travel, receptions, and official cars, the high-end Chinese liquor market in China has undergone extensive restructuring since 2012.

Chinese government officials had a long history of using high-end liquors at reception events. However, in 2012, the Chinese governments implemented policies designed to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, namely overseas travel, receptions, and use of government vehicles. Ripples of this anti-corruption campaign are felt beyond the high-end liquor industry, in sectors that heavily rely on China’s gifting culture and the lavish lifestyle of the privileged for growth. This extensive restructuring of Chinese liquor market caused by the anti-corruption campaign from Chinese government lasted for several years. As a result, the overall spending on high-end liquor market in China was limited and the sales volumes of Chinese high-end liquor has remained relatively flat until 2016. Nowadays, the structure of Chinese liquor market is stable again and has a steady growth supported by constant economic growth in China. Chinese consumers are expected to spend more on purchasing high-end liquors led by their increasing purchasing power.
 
Fenjiu Group and its subsidiaries are the sole suppliers of Fenjiu liquor in China. Fenjiu liquor has a relatively long history and is one of the world-famous Chinese liquor brands. Due to the Chinese government’s implementation of policies meant to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, sales revenue in the Fenjiu liquor market have followed a downward trend since 2012. However, with increasing per capita incomes and rising demand for mid-to-high-range products, the Fenjiu liquor market started to rebound in 2015, the market has expanded in terms of sales revenue to reach RMB5,117.9 million in 2016. Shanxi Province is the main market of Fenjiu liquor. Approximately 55% of Fenjiu liquor sales revenue was achieved in Shanxi in 2016. It is expected that the sales revenue of Fenjiu liquor will reach a further RMB10,532.0 million in China by 2022, increasing at a CAGR of 12.8% between 2016 and 2022.
 
According to the CIC report, at the end of 2016, the total number of Fenjiu liquor distributors reached 987 in China. The Fenjiu liquor distribution market is highly competitive with no single distributor occupying a major share of the market.
 
There are relatively high entry barriers for new competitors in the Fenjiu liquor distribution market. First, it is important for new entrants to get an authorization from Fenjiu Group, which is the sole provider of Fenjiu liquor products in China, to distribute Fenjiu Group’s products. Fenjiu Group started placing stricter requirements on its distributors, including, for example, new sales target, proven experience in the industry, past cooperation with Fenjiu Group. Thus, it has become increasingly difficult for new players to enter the market. Fenjiu liquor enjoys widespread popularity in and around Shanxi Province, with markets in other parts of China being significantly smaller. It is therefore important for new entrants to have a pre-existing distribution network in certain regions of China in order to be successful. It remains risky for new entrants to enter into new areas where Fenjiu liquor is not yet fully established and where the distribution market is already saturated. Distributors range from mom-and-pop stores in Shanxi Province to larger companies with years of experience in the Fenjiu liquor industry, each competing for a fair share of the market. Intense competition arises between distributors within the same region, selling the same or different Fenjiu brands. Fenjiu liquor includes a variety of products, differing in terms of ABV, vintage, recipe, etc. Although there are no dominant varieties in the market, some are preferred by end consumers more than others. However, almost all of these popular varieties have already been taken up by exclusive distributors. Thus, new entrants might find it difficult to source popular products directly from Fenjiu Group or will be left to source them from existing distributors, which entails lower profit margins.

Chinese Wine Market
 
According to the International Organization of Vine and Wine, or OIV, the per capita wine consumption in China is much lower than the US average level between 2012 and 2016. After the reduction of “three public consumptions” in 2013, China’s per capita consumption showed a further decrease. However, the consumption pattern has changed and the wine consumption has grown into a mass consumption accompanied by a decrease in wine price. Compared with the world average consumption, China’s per capita wine consumption has been around one-third of the world’s average since 2010. The relatively low per capita wine consumption in China indicates great growth potential for China’s wine market in the future.
 
According to the CIC report, Chinese consumers should, between 2017 and 2022, develop the habit of drinking wine rather than other alcoholic beverages, wine consumption is considered a healthier option. In addition, the development of O2O platforms selling wine will most certainly facilitate the purchase of wine in China.
 
There are three market drivers for China’s wine market. Firstly, China’s per capita disposable income has been increasing rapidly mainly due to increasing wages. Rising disposable income translates into increasing purchasing power for Chinese people; it also means that Chinese people tend to focus more on their quality of life. As wine is considered in China as a premium product with some beneficial health effect, we believe that increasing purchasing power will stimulate the further growth of wine consumption. In addition, the characteristics associated with drinking wine, such as beautification and antioxidation, play an important role in contributing to its consumption, especially for female customers. Secondly, China’s urbanization rate has been improving greatly during the past decades and the Chinese government sets up the goal that the urbanization rate of China is set to reach 60% by 2020. With the further improvement of the urbanization rate in China, the retail sales market is experiencing a rapid growth in urban regions in China. Thirdly, there are favorable national and international policies for imported wine. According to bilateral trade agreements signed by the PRC government with New Zealand, Chile and Australia, imported goods from the three countries will benefit from low tariff rates, effective from 2019. According to those agreements, by 2019, these tariffs will be totally eliminated. This favorable policy should reduce the wine retailing price and hence contribute to a growth in sales.
 
Our Strengths
 
Although we operate in a highly competitive industry, we believe that the following factors provide us with the competitive advantages in the marketplace that could differentiate us from our potential competitors:
 
Our Company has a high brand recognition in the Chinese Fenjiu liquor market
 
Our Fenjiu liquor is sold under the “Dagangjiu” brand and is one of the Chinese Fenjiu liquor market’s most popular brands. We have leveraged our business relationship with Fenjiu Group and relied on Fenjiu Group’s international fame to become one of the leading brands in international alcohol festivals. We believe that our brand’s strong recognition reinforces our existing customer goodwill in Shanxi province and beyond, providing us with a competitive advantage.
 
Our Marketing Team’s Extensive Experience and Superior Reputation in our Industry
 
We believe that our competitors’ marketing team cannot match our marketing experts’ extensive industry experience and their superior reputation. To some degree, our commercial campaigns are well accepted by consumer trends and resonate with potential liquor distribution partners.
 
Additionally, we believe our marketing expertise and design proficiency required to successfully attract new customers combined with our ability to generate a range of business concepts and capability to customize each sales opportunity according to customers’ need are advantages when competing in the Chinese Fenjiu market. Our expertise also allows us to successfully manage the numerous regional and cultural complexities involved in operating a traditional liquor business in China.
 
A Flexible Business Model
 
Our current business model is flexible. It can be adjusted to different products we sell and producers we sign cooperative agreements with. While operating a mix of marketing campaigns and business concepts under our own registered trademarks “Dagangjiu” and “Dagang Jiufang”, we entrust our liquor inventory to reputed large-scale producers. Currently, we are in a strategic partnership with Fenjiu Group.

Our current business strategy emphasizes on the marketing, packaging and distribution of Fenjiu liquor and imported wines. However, should we decide to change our business strategy catering to other popular liquor products such as Luzhou-flavor liquor and Maotai-flavor liquor, we can quickly adjust our marketing strategy and product packaging to meet customers’ evolving needs and preferences. Since our brand is well recognized and our current business model is based on flexible dealership, we can adjust our strategic partnerships to address new product preferences while maintaining our accumulated goodwill. This approach enables us to update marketing concepts and product mix at any time and allows us to be flexible in our marketing approach.
 
This flexible business model has contributed to the resilience of our business performance.
 
Service-driven and Cohesive Management Team
 
Our talented and dedicated senior management team has guided our organization through its expansion and, we believe, positioned us for continued growth. Additionally, our management team possesses extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines, including Chinese liquor marketing, sales, E-Commerce, finance, franchising and business management. Our management team embraces our core purpose to “promote premium alcoholic beverages to the Chinese population of all ages”. They are the promotors of our passionate and customer-oriented business culture, which is shared by our employees throughout our company. We believe our management team is service-driven and cohesive, focusing on the Company’s long-term business growth.

Fenjiu Liquor Wholesale and marketer
 
For our Fenjiu Liquor Wholesale and marketer business, we secure our strategic partnerships with dealers based on our market survey data, market positioning data, sales channels data, sales capabilities data and sales potential evaluation.

For our Fenjiu Liquor Wholesale and marketer business, we pay special attention to dealers with direct business access to retail stores and outlets. We sell our Fenjiu products with simple and bulk packaging to these dealers. The idea is to achieve larger profit margins through removing high-end designs and packaging, thus ensuring a relatively low price of our Fenjiu liquor products. Through this approach, we believe we can reach a greater number of Chinese customers who are attracted by the cost-effectiveness of our simple and bulk packaging products. We sell our simple and bulk packaging products to our targeted dealers who then directly resell these products to local retail stores and outlets.

Competition
 
There is intense competition in the Chinese liquor market. As a result, customers face a tremendous number of choices when deciding which brand or product to choose from.
 
As of June 30, 2019, Fenjiu Group has nearly 1,000 multi-layered distributors that often serve as Fenjiu brand co-builders. Although the Fenjiu Group is now widely known as the only producer of Fenjiu throughout the market, intense competition in the wholesale market remains since Fenjiu liquor distributors will continue working to co-build and enhance their respective brand image alongside Fenjiu Group to capture market shares from their competitors. Distributors range from mom-and-pop stores in Shanxi Province to larger companies with years of experience in the Fenjiu liquor industry, each competing for a fair share of the market. Competition can be even more intense amongst the distributors within the same region.
 
The Chinese wine market is also very competitive. Our competitors such as wine producers, distributors or retailers conduct various marketing activities and pricing strategies in an effort to keep their market shares, which directly impact our sales, revenues, and profitability. We follow the market trend closely and adjust our own advertising, promotion, pricing and sourcing strategies accordingly. In addition, competitors in the Chinese wine market compete against us for regaining highly qualified marketing personnel and staff members.
 
In response to the intense competition in the Chinese liquor and wine markets, we have implemented a number of initiatives designed to expand our revenues. Our revenue enhancement initiatives include expanding our marketing efforts, developing new products, and working with start-up companies and bulk-sale customers directly to decrease our marketing costs.

Currently, license for liquor wholesale is no longer required in nationwide level, but it is still required in some particular Provinces, such as Shanxi Province and Shanghai. In addition to Shanxi Province, the Company also sell liquor to other Provinces, namely Fujian, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, Beijing, Shanghai and Hebei Province. Liquor wholesale business of the Company is operated by its subsidiaries, Huaxin and Fenyang Jinqiang Wine Co., Ltd. (“Jinqiang”), both of which were established in Shanxi Province and have obtained wholesale licenses in Shanxi Province. According to our telephone consultation with the competent authorities in Beijing, Shanghai, Ningxia, Gansu and Hebei, no wholesale license is required for Huaxin or Jinqiang in such Provinces since Huaxin and Jinqiang were established in Shanxi Province and have already obtained wholesale licenses in Shanxi Province. In conclusion, no further wholesale license is required in other Provinces where the Company operates its business, unless the Company newly establish operating entity in such Provinces and license is still required for liquor wholesale business in such Provinces. 
 
Regarding the imported wine business, pursuant to the Foreign Trade Law of the People’s Republic of China (Revised in 2016), a foreign trade operator engaged in import and export of goods shall register with competent local regulatory authorities in Shanxi Province that in charge of foreign trades; and pursuant to the Administrative Provisions of the Customs of the People’s Republic of China on the Registration of Customs Declaration Entities, consignors and consignees of imported and exported goods shall go through customs declaration entity registration formalities with their local Customs in accordance with the applicable provisions.

The registration for a record as a foreign trade operator has no time limit; while the validity period for Certificate of the Customs of the PRC on the Registration of Customs Declaration Entities is two years and such certificate can be renewed before the expiration date. Nevertheless, Huaxin may be subject to penalties by PRC regulatory authorities if Huaxin fails to go through the modification formalities in the event of a change to any of its details registered with the competent governmental authorities including its name, nature, domicile and legal representative.

Regulations on Trademarks
 
The Trademark Law of the PRC was adopted at the 24th meeting of the SCNPC on August 23, 1982. Three amendments were made on February 22, 1993, October 27, 2001 and August 30, 2013. The last amendment was implemented on May 1, 2014. The Regulations on the Implementation of the Trademark Law of the PRC were promulgated by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China on August 3, 2002, which took effect on September 15, 2002. It was revised on April 29, 2014 and became effective as of May 1, 2014.

The trademark registrant shall enjoy the exclusive right to use the trademark and shall be protected by law. The trademark law also specifies the scope of registered trademarks, procedures for registration of trademarks and the rights and obligations of trademark owners. We are currently holding 5 registered trademarks in China and enjoy the corresponding rights.
Regulations on Patents
 
Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC, or the Patent Law, promulgated by the SCNPC on March 12, 1984, as latest amended on December 27, 2008, and effective from October 1, 2009 and the Implementation Rules of the Patent Law of the PRC, promulgated by the State Council on June 15, 2001 and latest amended on January 9, 2010, there are three types of patent in the PRC: invention patent, utility model patent and design patent. The protection period is 20 years for invention patent and 10 years for utility model patent and design patent, commencing from their respective application dates. Any individual or entity that utilizes a patent or conducts any other activity in infringement of a patent without prior authorization of the patentee shall pay compensation to the patentee and is subject to a fine imposed by relevant administrative authorities and, if constituting a crime, shall be held criminally liable in accordance with the law. In the event that a patent is owned by two or more co-owners without an agreement regarding the distribution of revenue generated from the exploitation of any co-owner of the patent, such revenue shall be distributed among all the co-owners.
 
Existing patents can become narrowed, invalid or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity, and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. Under the Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within 3 years from the date of application.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we had obtained two patents for liquor-making devices that can change proofs of various liquors, both of which were registered in 2015. Our issued PRC patents will expire in 2025.

PRC Laws and Regulations on Foreign Exchange
 
General Administration of Foreign Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, Renminbi is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13
 
Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.
 
If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.
 
Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, all of our beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.
 
Circular 19 and Circular 16
 
Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.
 
Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:
 

● | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      10

 


● | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.
 
Our PRC subsidiaries' distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.
 
PRC Laws and Regulations on Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “EIT Law”) was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.
 
The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.
 
In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.
 
Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.
 
In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.
 
On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.

According to the Notice on the Adjustment to the Value-added Tax Rates issued by the SAT and the MOF on April 4, 2018, where taxpayers make VAT taxable sales or import goods, the applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 17% to 16% and from 11% to 10%, respectively. Subsequently, the Notice on Policies for Deepening Reform of Value-added Tax was issued by the SAT, the MOF and the General Administration of Customs on March 30, 2019 and took effective on April 1, 2019, which further adjusted the applicable tax rate for taxpayers making VAT taxable sales or importing goods. The applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 9%, respectively.
 
Dividend Withholding Tax
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

They also have not deposited employees’ housing funds. Huaxin and its subsidiaries may be ordered by the housing provident fund management center to complete the registration formalities, open bank accounts, make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit. Failing to register or open bank accounts at the expiration of the time limit could result in fines of not less than 10,000 yuan nor more than 50,000 yuan. And an application may be made to a people’s court for compulsory enforcement if payment and deposit has not been made after the expiration of the time limit.
 
Customers
 
Our customers are downstream distributors. We rely upon several of our large customers from whom we generated substantial revenue each year, and the composition of our largest customers has changed from year to year. For the year ended June 30, 2019, five of our customers accounted for 13%, 12%, 12%, 11% and 10% of Huaxin’s revenue, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2018, five of our customers, Beijing Huaxin Rongfa Trading Co., Ltd., Fuqing Jing Hong Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai Baiwang Trading Co., Ltd., New Venus Trade (Fujian) Group Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Moneng Trading Co., Ltd. represented approximately 16.3%, 16.2%, 11.5%, 11.2% and 10.6% of Huaxin’s revenue, respectively. Huaxin currently engages its major customers with purchase agreements negotiated on an arm’s length basis. These purchase agreements customarily cover a one-year period and contain material subsections such as targeted customers’ selling goals, representation and warranties of the customers, rights and responsibility of the customers, pricing adjustment, logistics and shipping, payment methods, downstream management and dispute resolutions. While we believe that one or more of our major customers could account for a significant portion of our sales for at least the year 2019, we anticipate that our customer’s base will continue to expand and that in the future we will be less dependent on major customers.
Suppliers
 
We primarily rely upon a few main suppliers from whom we purchase materials each year. For the year ended June 30, 2019, three of our suppliers accounted for 52%, 21%, and 13% of our total supply purchases.

All supplier contracts with large suppliers were entered from year to year on an arm’s length basis.
 
In general, we enter into procurement agreements in the ordinary course of business with our suppliers, pursuant to a form of supply order typically on a “deal by deal” basis. However, we have a strategic partnership with Fenjiu Group. Most recently, we entered into a partnership agreement with Fenjiu Group on June 30, 2017, pursuant to which Fenjiu Group has agreed to supply us with $4,379,850 worth of Fenjiu liquor during a three-year period from June 30, 2017 to June 29, 2020. We agreed to buy $4,379,850 worth of Fenjiu liquor using our best effort pursuant to this strategic partnership agreement, he underwriter has no obligation or commitment to purchase any securities. If the contract is renewed, the two parties must agree on the terms of contract cooperation for the next year before June 29 of each year and sign a cooperation contract for the next year. The foregoing description of the strategic agreement and the terms and conditions of such agreement is qualified in their entirety by the complete text of the strategic agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 (the “Partnership Agreement”) to the Form S-1 with SEC on July 3, 2019 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business.
