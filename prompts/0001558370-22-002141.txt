ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2004. The principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky.
General Development of Business
The Company is a growing restaurant company operating predominately in the casual dining segment. Our late founder, W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 667 restaurants in 49 states and ten foreign countries. Our mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service®." Our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants as the local hometown favorite for a broad segment of consumers seeking high quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 28, 2021, we owned and operated 566 restaurants and franchised an additional 70 domestic restaurants and 31 international restaurants. 
Narrative Description of Business
Of the 566 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2021, we operated 526 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, 36 as Bubba’s 33 restaurants and four as Jaggers restaurants. 
Texas Roadhouse is a moderately priced, full-service, casual dining restaurant concept offering an assortment of specially seasoned and aged steaks hand-cut daily on the premises and cooked to order over open grills. In addition to steaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority of our entrées include two made-from-scratch side items, and we offer all our dine-in guests a free unlimited supply of roasted in-shell peanuts and fresh baked yeast rolls.
Bubba’s 33 is a family-friendly, sports restaurant concept featuring scratch-made food, ice cold beer and signature drinks. Our menu features burgers, pizza and wings as well as a wide variety of appetizers, sandwiches and dinner entrées. Our first Bubba’s 33 restaurant opened in May 2013 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Jaggers is a fast-casual restaurant concept offering burgers, hand-breaded chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches served with scratch-made sauces. In addition, we offer fresh salads that are tossed when ordered and served with homemade dressings. Jaggers offers drive-thru, carry-out, and dine-in service options. Our first Jaggers restaurant opened in December 2014 in Noblesville, Indiana.
Throughout this report, we use the term "restaurants" to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33, unless otherwise noted.
Segment Information
We manage our restaurant and franchising operations by concept and as a result have identified Texas Roadhouse, Bubba’s 33, Jaggers and our retail initiatives (including our online store and royalty-based licensing arrangements) as separate operating segments. In addition, we have identified Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 as reportable segments. 
COVID-19 and Related Impacts
​
The Company has been subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (the “pandemic”). These include federal, state and local restrictions on restaurants, some of which have limited capacity or seating in dining rooms while others have allowed to-go or curbside service only. As of December 28, 2021, all of our domestic company and franchise locations were operating without restriction. As of December 29, 2020, all of our domestic company and franchise locations were operating their dining rooms under various limited capacity restrictions or were limited to outdoor and/or to-go or curbside service only.
As a result of these restrictions, we developed a hybrid operating model to accommodate our dining room restrictions together with enhanced to-go. We continue to see sales in our to-go program higher than pre-pandemic levels, even with dining rooms operating without restriction. We cannot predict how long we will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the extent to which our dining rooms will have to close again or otherwise have limited

seating, or if the increased sales in our to-go program will continue. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, or financial condition will depend on future developments which are outside of our control. This includes, without limitation, the efficacy and public acceptance of vaccination programs and/or testing mandates in curbing the spread of the virus, the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus, which may prove resistant to currently approved vaccines, and new or reinstated restrictions or regulations on our operations. 
As a result of a significant increase in sales, the lingering impact of the pandemic, and other supply constraints, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience commodity cost inflation and certain food and supply shortages. The commodity cost inflation, which primarily relates to beef, is due to increased costs incurred by our vendors related to higher labor, transportation, packaging, and raw material costs. To date, we have been able to properly manage any food or supply shortages but have experienced increased costs. If our vendors are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts, we may encounter further shortages and/or higher costs to secure adequate supply and a possible loss of sales, any of which would harm our business. 
In addition, as our dining rooms have returned to operating without restriction, our ability to attract and retain restaurant-level employees has become more challenging due to an increasingly competitive job market throughout the country. We have also experienced periodic staffing shortages due to employees testing positive or having to quarantine due to exposure to the virus. To the extent these challenges persist, we could continue to experience increased labor costs and/or decreased sales. 
As a result of the pandemic, legislation referred to as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was passed in 2020 to benefit companies that were significantly impacted by the pandemic. This legislation allowed for the deferral of the social security portion of the employer portion of FICA payroll taxes from the date of enactment through the end of 2020. In total, we deferred $47.3 million in payroll taxes, of which $24.3 million was repaid in 2021 and $23.0 million is required to be repaid by the end of 2022. The amount due in 2022 is included in accrued wages and payroll taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. 
The CARES Act also allowed for an Employee Retention Credit for companies severely impacted by the pandemic to encourage the retention of full-time employees. This refundable payroll tax credit was available for any company that had fully or partially suspended operations due to government order or experienced a significant decline in gross receipts and had employees who were paid but did not actually work. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Company has provided various forms of relief pay for hourly restaurant employees, a significant portion of which qualified for this tax credit. For the years ended December 28, 2021 and December 29, 2020, we recorded $1.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, related to this credit which is included as a reduction to labor expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
​
Operating Strategy
The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concepts is built on the following key components:

● | Offering high quality, freshly prepared food. We place a great deal of emphasis on providing our guests with high quality, freshly prepared food. As part of our process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of promoting consistent adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. At our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we hand-cut all but one of our assortment of steaks and make our sides from scratch.

● | Offering performance-based manager compensation. We offer a performance-based compensation program to our individual restaurant managers and multi-restaurant operators, who are called "managing partners" and "market partners," respectively. Each of these partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant’s pre-tax income. As a result of the pandemic and the impact on restaurant operating results, we guaranteed a portion of these performance bonuses in the periods that were the most significantly impacted. By providing our partners with a significant stake in the success of our restaurants and underscoring our long-term commitment to them during the pandemic with guaranteed bonuses, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focusing on dinner. In nearly all of our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday. By focusing on dinner, our restaurant teams have to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week. We believe this allows our restaurant teams to offer higher quality, more consistent food and service to our guests. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offering attractive price points. We offer our food and beverages at moderate price points that we believe are as low as or lower than those offered by many of our competitors in any given market. Within each menu category, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of fulfilling each guest’s budget and value expectations. For example, at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, our steak entrées, which include the choice of two side items, generally range from $11.99 for our 6-ounce Sirloin to $29.99 for our 23-ounce Porterhouse T-Bone. The per guest average check for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants we owned and operated in 2021 was $19.68. Per guest average check represents restaurant sales divided by the number of guests served. We consider each sale of an entrée to be a single guest served. Our per guest average check is higher as a result of our weekday dinner only focus. At our Bubba’s 33 restaurants, our entrées range from $9.99 for our Classic Cheeseburger to $21.49 for our 16-inch Meaty Meaty pizza. The per guest average check for the Bubba’s 33 restaurants we owned and operated in 2021 was $18.94.

● | Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere with a focus on high quality service. We believe the service quality and atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. We focus on keeping our table-to-server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus on their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner. Our Texas Roadhouse restaurants feature a rustic southwestern lodge décor accentuated with hand-painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, our restaurants continuously play upbeat country hits. Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing sporting events and music videos and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair.

Unit Prototype and Economics
We design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on restaurant-level returns over time. Our current prototypical Texas Roadhouse restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 7,600 to 8,400 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 acres or retail pad sites, with seating of approximately 58 to 68 tables for a total of 270 to 325 guests, including 18 bar seats, and parking for approximately 180 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross parking arrangement. Our current prototypes are adaptable to in-line and end-cap locations and/or spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping center. 
Our current prototypical Bubba’s 33 restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 7,200 to 8,800 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 acres or retail pad sites. This includes seating of approximately 55 to 59 tables for a total of 270 to 330 guests, including 26 to 46 bar seats. Some locations include patio seating with an additional 10 tables and up to 60 seats. Parking is targeted for approximately 180 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross parking arrangement. 
In response to the pandemic, we made building modifications and/or expansions to a number of existing restaurants. These changes were made to better accommodate the increase in our to-go sales and/or alternative dining arrangements. We also installed booth partitions in all of our restaurants as an added safety measure for our guests.

​
For 2021 and 2020, our average capital investment for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants was $5.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The decrease in our 2021 average capital investment was primarily due to lower land and building costs. The higher land costs in 2020 were due to increased rent amounts at several sites. The higher building costs in 2020 were due to higher material costs and construction delays related to the pandemic as well as sites located in more expensive areas. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2022 to be approximately $6.3 million due to increased supply costs. 
Our average capital investment for the Bubba’s 33 restaurants opened in 2021 and 2020 was $7.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The increase in our 2021 average capital investment for our Bubba’s 33 restaurants was primarily due to higher rent costs. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2022 to be approximately $7.3 million. 
We remain focused on driving sales and managing restaurant investment costs in order to maintain our restaurant development in the future. Our capital investment (including cash and non-cash costs) for new restaurants varies significantly depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the square footage, layout, scope of required site work, geographical location, supply chain costs, type of construction labor (union or non-union), local permitting requirements, our ability to negotiate with landowners and/or landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and hook-up fees.

Site Selection
We continue to refine our site selection process. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team and our restaurant market partners devote significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density, household income levels and site-specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic generators, proximity of other retail activities and competitors, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with experienced real estate brokers in target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly update our database of potential sites. We typically require three to six months to locate, approve and control a restaurant site and typically six to 14 additional months to obtain necessary permits. Upon receipt of permits, we require approximately five months to construct, equip and open a restaurant.
