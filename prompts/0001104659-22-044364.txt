ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
On December 31, 2021, the Company closed on the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) and two Software Purchase Agreements (the “Software Purchase Agreements” and, together with the Equity Purchase Agreement and the other transaction documents described therein, the “Purchase Agreements”) dated as of October 15, 2021, with subsidiaries and affiliates of PartnerOne Capital, Inc. (the “Purchasers”). The Purchase Agreements provided for the sale and transfer of substantially all of the Company’s operating subsidiaries and all of its assets that provided real-time digital engagement solutions and services in the areas of real-time analytics, customer acquisition and activation, customer value management and loyalty for the telecom industry to the Purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $40 million (subject to adjustment as set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement). The Purchase Agreements included customary terms and conditions, including an adjustment to the purchase price based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the closing date and provisions that require the Company to indemnify the Purchasers for certain losses that it incurs as a result of a breach by the Company of its representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreements and certain other matters. The Company received cash proceeds of $36.0 million and may receive up to an additional $2.5 million in consideration pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement entered into in connection with the Equity Purchase Agreement. 
Simultaneously with the approval by the board of directors of the Company to execute the Purchase Agreements, the board formed a subcommittee of the board (the “Investment Committee”) to evaluate options to maximize the value of the Company’s assets, which, following the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreements, will consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The board of directors has authorized the Investment Committee to retain such counsel, experts, consultants or other professionals as the Investment Committee shall deem appropriate from time to time to aid the Investment Committee in the performance of its duties.
Following the sale of its assets in real-time digital engagement solutions and services in December 2021, the Company has decided to evaluate new areas of business and is currently a research and development organization with two initial areas of product focus, each of which are in a research-oriented pre-release mode. The two areas of focus are in the application of self-learning algorithms as well as the symbolic tagging and organizing of physical objects.
The Company is developing a set of proprietary algorithms that model and predict behavior of dynamic systems. The algorithms it is developing are novel but based on the team’s collective experience having built big data and machine learning systems that drove marketing programs for almost a billion consumers in its previous operating businesses at the Company. There exists a set of code that is currently in an engineering-complete first stage of development and ready for testing and quality control changes. These algorithms can be used for a number of purposes including consumer behavior detection and prediction as well as for the modeling of the behavior of physical and financial objects. In particular, the company is focusing its application on the modeling of the behavior of chaotic crypto-based financial instruments. In 2022, the Company expects that it will implement back-testing of algorithms against historical data sets; migrating to real-time testing against live transaction data and implementing small-scale testing of automated algorithms.
The Company has also begun developing a set of tools and technologies for applying (‘sticking’) symbolic content to physical objects to catalog and, in doing so, gaining the ability to track real-world objects in a novel way. This technique and the databases created as a result can be used in a range of applications including travel, crowd-sourced organic information (crime, parking, etc.), as well as for historical and demographic research.
In this development area of the symbol tagging application, the team is building a set of databases and prototypes which are currently working in a test environment. The development includes a prototype front end which is running on Apple’s iOS as well as a back-end which is based on Java, Linux, and MySQL. This initiative remains in an early, research-oriented stage.
Finally, the Company’s directors and executives maintains an extensive background in mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity. The Company plans to use its cash assets, and network of relationships to seek to acquire businesses and/or assets as well as consider strategic partners.

COMPETITION
We have noted that we are currently engaged in research and development with two initial areas of product focus, each of which is in a research-oriented pre-release mode. The market for these products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, changing industry standards, regulatory developments and consolidation. As the products enter their target markets, we will identify further our principal competitors in each market.
We are also focused on identifying, acquiring and operating fairly valued to undervalued businesses that have growth potential. Due to current market conditions, we face significant competition from strategic and, in particular, financial buyers which, in any instance, may raise seller valuation expectations above what we would consider to be attractive levels for our management and our shareholders. We continue to believe that additional fairly and undervalued opportunities exist and are attainable. We do not intend to pursue what we consider to be over-valued businesses and assets that we believe may not deliver the levels of returns we target.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 8 people all located in the United States. Our employees are not unionized.
