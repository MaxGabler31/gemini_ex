The Automotive Aftermarket
 
The automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size. In addition to manufacturing, aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend. Aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support. Aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute, with rapid turnaround times, products for a full range of domestic and import vehicles on the road. The primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are large retail chains, national and regional warehouse distributors, automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).
 
The automotive aftermarket industry differs substantially from the OEM supply business. Unlike the OEM supply business that primarily follows trends in new car production, the automotive aftermarket industry’s performance primarily tends to follow different trends, such as:
 
  
· | growth in number of vehicles on the road;
--+------------------------------------------


· | increase in average vehicle age;
--+---------------------------------


· | change in total miles driven per year;
--+---------------------------------------


· | new or modified environmental and vehicle safety regulations, including fuel-efficiency and emissions reduction standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increase in pricing of new cars;
--+---------------------------------


· | economic and financial market conditions;
--+------------------------------------------


· | new car quality and related warranties;
--+----------------------------------------


· | changes in automotive technologies;
--+------------------------------------


· | change in vehicle scrap rates; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | change in average fuel prices.
--+-------------------------------



Traditionally, the parts manufacturers of OEMs and the independent manufacturers who supply the original equipment (“OE”) part applications have supplied a majority of the business to new car dealer networks. However, certain parts manufacturers have become more independent and are no longer affiliated with OEMs, which has provided, and may continue to provide, opportunities for us to supply replacement parts to the dealer service networks of the OEMs, both for warranty and out‑of‑warranty repairs.

 Index

We are a basic manufacturer of many of the engine management parts we market.  Our strategy includes expanding our product lines through strategic acquisitions in addition to sourcing certain materials and products from low cost regions such as those in Asia.  In our Engine Management Segment, replacement parts for ignition, emission control and fuel systems accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 58% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 62% of our consolidated net sales in 2015.
 
Computer-Controlled Technology. Nearly all new vehicles are factory‑equipped with computer‑controlled engine management systems to monitor and control ignition, emissions, fuel economy, transmission and many other automotive systems.  The on‑board computers monitor inputs from many types of sensors located throughout the vehicle, and control a myriad of valves, solenoids, coils, switches and motors to manage engine and vehicle performance. Computer-controlled engine management systems enable the engine to operate with improved fuel efficiency and reduced levels of hazardous emissions.
 
Government mandated emissions and fuel economy regulations have been implemented throughout the United States. The Clean Air Act imposes strict emissions control test standards on existing and new vehicles, and remains the preeminent legislation in the area of vehicle emissions.  As many states have implemented required inspection/maintenance tests, the Environmental Protection Agency, through its rulemaking ability, has also encouraged both manufacturers and drivers to reduce vehicle emissions.  Automobiles must now comply with emissions standards from the time they were manufactured and, in most states, until the last day they are in use.  This law and other government emissions laws and fuel economy regulations have had a positive impact on sales of our ignition, emissions control and fuel delivery parts since vehicles failing these laws may require repairs utilizing parts sold by us.
 
Our sales of sensors, valves, solenoids and related parts have increased as automobile manufacturers equip their cars with more complex engine management systems.
 
Safety, Driver Assistance and Collision Avoidance Systems. An increasing number of new vehicles are factory equipped with government-mandated safety devices, such as anti-lock braking systems and air bags. As these systems mature, requiring servicing and repair, we anticipate increased sales opportunities for many of our products such as ABS sensors, tire pressure monitoring systems, and traction control products.  Newer automotive systems include Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Collision Avoidance Systems to alert the driver to potential problems, or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards. Many of these systems use on-board computers to monitor inputs from sensing devices located throughout the vehicle.  As the use and complexity of these systems continue to develop and proliferate, we expect to identify and benefit from new sales opportunities within this category such as ultrasonic sensors.
Wire and Cable Products. Wire and cable parts accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 14% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2015.  These products include ignition (spark plug) wires, battery cables, pigtails, sockets and a wide range of electrical wire, terminals, connectors and tools for servicing an automobile’s electrical system.
 
We have historically offered ignition wires and battery cables under premium brands, which capitalize on the market’s awareness of the importance of quality, along with “value” priced brands for older vehicle applications. We extrude high voltage ignition wire for use in our wire sets. The vertical integration of this critical component offers us the ability to achieve lower costs and a controlled source of supply and quality.
 
In May 2016, we acquired the North American automotive ignition wire business of General Cable Corporation.  The acquisition included General Cable Corporation’s automotive ignition wire business in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  For additional information regarding this acquisition and our integration efforts, refer to the information set forth under the captions “2016 Business Acquisitions” and “Integration Costs” appearing in Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Temperature Control Segment
 
We manufacture, remanufacture and distribute a full line of replacement parts for automotive temperature control (air conditioning and heating) systems, engine cooling systems, power window accessories and windshield washer systems, primarily under our brand names of Four Seasons®, EVERCO®, ACi® and Hayden® and through co-labels and private labels such as NAPA Temp Products™, Cold Power®, DriveworksTM, ToughOneTM and Murray®.  The major product groups sold by our Temperature Control Segment are new and remanufactured compressors, clutch assemblies, blower and radiator fan motors, filter dryers, evaporators, accumulators, hose assemblies, thermal expansion devices, heater valves, heater cores, AC service tools and chemicals, fan assemblies, fan clutches, oil coolers, window lift motors, window regulators and assemblies, and windshield washer pumps.  Our temperature control products accounted for approximately 25% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, and approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015.
 
Our Temperature Control business continues to implement cost savings initiatives in response to offshore competitive price pressures.  We have consolidated excess manufacturing facilities and have implemented a program to improve our manufacturing and distribution efficiencies.  In February 2016, we began implementation of a plant rationalization initiative to relocate certain production activities from our Grapevine, Texas manufacturing facility to facilities in Greenville, South Carolina and Reynosa, Mexico, relocate certain service functions from Grapevine, Texas to our administrative offices in Lewisville, Texas, and close our Grapevine, Texas facility.  We are also continuing to improve our cost position through our global sourcing initiatives in low cost regions and by increasing our production of remanufactured and new compressors in our facility in Reynosa, Mexico.  As of December 31, 2017, all of our Grapevine Texas production activities have been relocated.
 
We are also continuing to improve our cost position through our global sourcing initiatives in low cost regions, increasing our production of remanufactured and new compressors in our facility in Reynosa, Mexico, and through strategic transactions with manufacturers in low cost regions.  In April 2014, we formed a joint venture with Gwo Yng Enterprise Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of air conditioning accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies, and switches.  In November 2017, we formed a separate joint venture with Foshan Guangdong Automotive Air Conditioning Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of air conditioning compressors.  We believe that these transactions will enhance our position as a basic low-cost manufacturer and a leading supplier of temperature control parts to the aftermarket, as well as provide us with an opportunity for growth in the China market.
 
Today’s vehicles are being produced with more complex AC systems that are designed to improve their efficiency and reduce their size.  Our Temperature Control Segment continues to be a leader in providing superior training to service dealers who require access to up-to-date knowledge in proper maintenance and repair for changing technologies utilized in today’s vehicles.  We believe that our training module (Diagnosing and Repairing the Top Automotive HVAC Problems) remains one of the most sought-after training clinics in the industry and among professional service dealers.

Sales and Distribution
 
In the traditional channel, we sell our products to warehouse distributors, who supply auto parts jobber stores. Jobbers in turn sell to professional technicians and to “do-it-yourselfers” who perform automotive repairs on their personal vehicles. In recent years, warehouse distributors have consolidated with other distributors, and an increasing number of distributors own their jobber stores or sell down channel to professional technicians. In the retail channel, customers buy directly from us and sell directly to professional technicians and “do-it-yourselfers” through their own stores. Retailers are also consolidating with other retailers and have begun to increase their efforts to sell to professional technicians adding additional competition in the “do-it-for-me,” or the professional technician segment of our industry.
 
As automotive parts and systems become more complex, “do-it-yourselfers” are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on automotive dealerships and independent service dealer technicians.  In addition to new car sales, automotive dealerships sell OE brand parts and service vehicles.  The products available through the dealers are purchased through the original equipment service (“OES”) network.  Traditionally, the parts manufacturers of OEMs have supplied a majority of the OES network.  However, certain parts manufacturers have become independent and are no longer affiliated with OEMs.  In addition, many Tier 1 OEM suppliers are disinterested in providing service parts requirements for up to 15 years after the OE model has gone out of production.  As a result of these factors, there are additional opportunities for independent automotive aftermarket manufacturers like us to supply the OES network.
 
Our sales force is structured to meet the unique needs of our traditional and retail customers across the distribution channel, allowing us to provide value-added services that we believe are unmatched by our competitors.  We also believe that our sales force is the premier direct sales force for our product lines due to our concentration of highly‑qualified, well‑trained sales personnel.  We provide our sales personnel extensive instruction at our training facility in Irving, Texas and provide an extensive continuing education program that allows our sales force to stay current on troubleshooting and repair techniques.  The continuing education courses along with monthly supplemental web-based training are an integral part of our sales force development strategy.
 
In addition to training our sales personnel in the function and application of our products, we thoroughly train our sales personnel in proven sales techniques.  Our traditional and retail customers, therefore, have come to depend on these sales personnel as a reliable source for technical information and to assist with sales to their customers (i.e., jobber stores, “do-it-yourselfers,” and professional technicians).  In this manner, we direct a significant portion of our sales efforts to our customers’ customers to generate demand for our products, and we believe that the structure of our sales force facilitates these efforts by enabling us to implement our sales and marketing programs uniformly throughout the distribution channel.  One of the ways we generate this demand is by offering technician seminars, which teach over 65,000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair vehicles equipped with complex systems related to our products. We also offer on-demand webinars through the Internet on similar topics.  Approximately 15,000 technicians were registered to participate in such sessions in 2017.  To help our sales personnel to be effective teachers and trainers, we focus our recruitment efforts on candidates who have technical backgrounds as well as strong sales experience.

We offer a variety of strategic customer discounts, allowances and incentives to increase customer purchases of our products.  For example, we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice, and we offer pricing discounts based on volume purchased from us and participation in our cost reduction initiatives.  We also offer rebates and discounts to customers as advertising and sales force allowances, and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided.  We believe these discounts, allowances and incentives are a common practice throughout the automotive aftermarket industry, and we intend to continue to offer them in response to competitive pressures and to strategically support the growth of all our products.
Customers
 
Our customer base is comprised largely of warehouse distributors, large retailers, OE/OES customers, other manufacturers and export customers.  Our five largest individual customers accounted for approximately 70% of our consolidated net sales in 2017 and 2016, and approximately 68% of our consolidated net sales in 2015.  During 2017, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, Inc., NAPA Auto Parts, and AutoZone, Inc. accounted for 21%, 17%, 16% and 10% of our consolidated net sales, respectively.  Net sales from each of the customers were reported in both our Engine Management and Temperature Control Segments.
Competition
 
We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for product lines in Engine Management and Temperature Control. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, product availability, value-added services, product coverage, order turn‑around time, order fill rate, technical support and price. We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily through:

· | a value‑added, knowledgeable sales force;
--+------------------------------------------


· | extensive product coverage in conjunction with market leading brands;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | rigorous product qualification standards to ensure that our parts meet or exceed exacting performance specifications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sophisticated parts cataloguing systems, including catalogues available online through our website and our mobile application;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | inventory levels and logistical systems sufficient to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | breadth of manufacturing capabilities; and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | award-winning marketing programs and sales support and technical training.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------



In the Engine Management business, we are one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors in the United States. Our competitors include ACDelco, Delphi Technologies PLC, Denso Corporation, Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., Dorman Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies importing products from Asia.
 
Our Temperature Control business is one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors of a full line of temperature control products in North America and other geographic areas. ACDelco, MAHLE GmbH, Behr Hella Service GmbH, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden International, Inc., Continental AG, and several privately-owned companies are some of our key competitors in this market.
 
The automotive aftermarket is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve.  Our success in the marketplace continues to depend on our ability to offer competitive prices, improved products, superior value-added services and expanded offerings in competition with many other suppliers to the aftermarket.  Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.  In addition, we face competition from automobile manufacturers who supply many of the replacement parts sold by us, although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they produce through OE dealerships.

Seasonality
 
Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment. It is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business.  In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories. For example, a cool summer, as we experienced in 2017, may lessen the demand for our Temperature Control products, while a warm summer, as we experienced in 2016, may increase such demand.  As a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products, our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received. During this period, our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.
Working Capital and Inventory Management
 
Automotive aftermarket companies have been under increasing pressure to provide broad SKU (stock keeping unit) coverage due to parts and brand proliferation. In response to this, we have made, and continue to make, changes to our inventory management system designed to reduce inventory requirements. We have a pack‑to‑order distribution system, which permits us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until an order for a specific branded part is received. This system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory. We also expanded our inventory management system to improve inventory deployment, enhance our collaboration with customers on forecasts and inventory assortments, and further integrate our supply chain both to customers and suppliers.
 
We face inventory management issues as a result of overstock returns.  We permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us) in the event that they have overstocked their inventories.  In addition, the seasonality of our Temperature Control Segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns.
 
Our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to our sales mix of Temperature Control products.  Our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received.  These increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
 
Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass, electronic components, fabricated copper (primarily in the form of magnet and insulated cable), steel magnets, laminations, tubes and shafts, stamped steel parts, copper wire, stainless steel coils and rods, aluminum coils, fittings, rods, cast aluminum parts, lead, steel roller bearings, rubber molding compound, thermo‑set and thermo plastic molding powders, and chemicals.  Additionally, we use components and cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps.
 
We purchase materials in the U.S. and foreign open markets and have a limited number of supply agreements on key components. A number of prime suppliers make these materials available. In the case of cores for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps, we obtain them either from exchanges with customers who return cores subsequent to purchasing remanufactured parts or through direct purchases from a network of core brokers. In addition, we acquire certain materials by purchasing products that are resold into the market, particularly by OEM sources and other domestic and foreign suppliers.

We believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores. In order to ensure a consistent, high quality and low cost supply of key components for each product line, we continue to develop our own sources.  We are not dependent on any single commodity, however, there can be no assurance over the long term that increases in commodity prices will not materially affect our business or results of operations.
Production and Engineering
 
We engineer, tool and manufacture many of the components used in the assembly of our products. We also perform our own plastic molding operations, stamping and machining operations, wire extrusion, automated electronics assembly and a wide variety of other processes. In the case of remanufactured components, we conduct our own teardown, diagnostics and rebuilding for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps. We have found this level of vertical integration provides advantages in terms of cost, quality and availability. We intend to continue selective efforts toward further vertical integration to ensure a consistent quality and supply of low cost components. In addition, our strategy includes sourcing an increasing number of finished goods and component parts from low cost regions such as those in Asia.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,200 people, with 1,900 people in the United States and 2,300 people in Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K., Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Of the 4,200 people employed, approximately 2,100 people are production employees. We operate primarily in non‑union facilities and have binding labor agreements with employees at other unionized facilities.  We have approximately 90 production employees in Edwardsville, Kansas who are covered by a contract with The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) that expires in April 2019.  We expect to renew this agreement with the UAW upon mutually agreeable terms.  We also have approximately 1,100 employees in Mexico who are covered under union agreements negotiated at various intervals.
 
We believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our union and non‑union employees are good. Our employees share our corporate values of ethics, integrity, common decency and respect of others, values which have been established since our company was founded in 1919.
