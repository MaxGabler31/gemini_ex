ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
United Health Products, Inc. ("United" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. The product HemoStyp, is derived from regenerated oxidized cellulose, which is all natural, and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and helps control bleeding. The Company is focused on identifying new markets and applications for its product as well as ramping up sales in its current markets. The Company has received orders from the veterinarian, dental and medical markets and is pursuing multiple markets for HemoStyp, including the medical, sports, dental and military sectors, each of which represents multi-million-dollar markets. 
Recent Developments
 
The following developments in the Company’s business have occurred since the beginning of 2017:
 
 
· | Patterson Veterinary/AHI is a distributor of our HempStyp products to the United States animal and dental market. Patterson is one of the largest animal health companies in the United States.

· | In February 2018, the Company completed and submitted to the FDA all materials relevant for the pre-market approval (“PMA”) for HemoStyp under the FDA’s new and innovative CtQ Pilot-Program as a Class III application for internal surgical procedures. 
 | The FDA selected UHP’s HemoStyp as only one of nine participants for the program. The Company’s management scheduled and had its first face-to-face meeting with FDA experts on January 17, 2018 to provide the agency with whatever information it needs to advance the application for premarket approval (PMA). The FDA has stated that it intends to work collaboratively with pilot program participants during the review of their PMA submission to define characteristics of the device that are critical to product quality, and how these characteristics are controlled in design and manufacturing prior to the post market inspection. For pilot program participants, the FDA would forego conducting the standard PMA preapproval inspection, and a post market inspection focusing on the PMA applicant’s implementation of the critical to quality characteristics would be conducted instead. The CtQ Pilot Program was created to identify products that have a chemical makeup of demonstrated safe interaction with the body –as evidenced by years of prior product usage and studies-- to be approved for Class III internal surgical use. The program’s intent is to allow products that have demonstrated repeated safe interaction to enter the market in a more efficient manner. The market for 2017 internal surgical market for hemostatic products is estimated at in excess of seven billion dollars, and is expected to grow at 7.1% over the next few years, to reach more than $8.3 billion by 2022. 


· | The Company’s 2” x 4” Trauma Gauze™ product has been selected as the feature component for a new Advanced Wound Care Kit for Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE DKS). With today’s environment when the unexpected can happen anywhere, both in the wild and in urban areas, having an advanced trauma kit can be the difference between survival and tragedy. The Hemostyp® pouches have been included under the Field and Stream label and are available in their stores nationwide since February 2018 and are displayed in various locations throughout the stores.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In December 2017, the Company announced it is applying to have HemoStyp designated as a Class III medical device with Australia’s Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA, counterpart to the U.S. FDA). Similar to the US FDA Class III application, TGA approval would allow for internal surgical use. The Company’s Australian TGA consultants believe that UHP has the requisite test data and documentation to obtain rapid approval in Australia, and that HemoStyp® could obtain approval for use in the Australian market within 30 days.

· | In January 2018, the Company’s distribution partner Quantum Health Group filed an application for class III use in general internal surgical procedures with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in South Korea. Quantum anticipates a response within 70 days. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety provides the vision of "Safe Food and Drug, Healthy People, Well-being Society" and making extensive efforts to safeguard consumers and promote the public health by ensuring the safety of all foods, drugs, cosmetics, herbal medicines, and medical devices that South Koreans have in their daily lives. The importance of risk management for food and drug safety is ever growing and the scope of management is expanding. As more and more people are seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle, it is crucial to ensure that the food and drugs they have are safe and effective.

· | In March 2018, the Company obtained Class III and CE mark approval for HemoStyp in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises the 28 European Union members and a number of other countries. Accordingly, HemoStyp is approved for use in internal surgical procedures in more than 30 countries. The approval was received following the provision of all required documentation by the relevant regulatory agencies. The CE marking– CE is an acronym for the French term "Conformité Européenne"– certifies that a product has met EEA health, safety, and environmental requirements, which ensure consumer safety. Manufacturers in the EEA and abroad must meet CE marking requirements where applicable to market their products in Europe. A manufacturer who has gone through the conformity assessment process may affix the CE mark to its product. With the CE marking, the product may be marketed throughout the EEA, which comprises 33 countries with a population of exceeding 517 million and a GDP exceeding $17 trillion.

Primary Strategy
 
The Company's gauze products are designed for the wound care market and manufactured to our specifications at various facilities. We have engaged in Quality Control audits to bring those facilities online. This allows us rapid production expansion while protecting the company from any one specific facility causing any slowdown. We believe redundancy and protection of our manufacturing is key to our short-term success. The gauze can be used on any wound where bleeding is present. Upon contact with moisture, the gauze forms a gel-like substance that acts as a hemostatic agent to address bleeding quickly. The hemostatic gauze derived from regenerated oxidized/cellulose, which is all natural and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and helps to control bleeding. Once bleeding has ceased and coagulation has occurred, the product can be rinsed away with saline solution or lukewarm water. After acquiring the intellectual property rights, in 2009, we have devoted our time to obtaining necessary approvals to enable the hemostatic gauze product to be sold worldwide as well as attempting to establish an international distribution network.
 
The Company has the ability to represent to distributors and customers that its gauze products meet all the FDA requirements. This approval now allows us to expand our potential customer base and pursue accounts that requested a current 510(k) FDA approval, including the prescription based medical arena, veterinary, retail, hospital, EMS, military, state and national governmental agencies and veterinary markets. Our gauze products can be used to stop nose bleeds and for post dialysis treatment and venipuncture.
 
The Company's strategy is to engage distributors to market the Company's gauze products to the various worldwide markets. The Company has an initial foundation for the distribution of its hemostatic gauze products by entering into agreements with our several distributors/partners (covering the dental, veterinarian, U.S. retail, U.S. military and worldwide equestrian markets and Australasia). We have distribution agreements to commence in South Korea, South Africa and additional parts of Asia upon individual regulatory country approvals. The Distributor (SSEM) for the South African market has signed their agreement in late 2017 and was shipped their opening stock order in December of 2017.

Our HemoStyp Gauze Products
 
HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is a collagen-like natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose. It is an effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The HemoStyp hemostatic material contains no chemical additives, thrombin or collagen, and is hypoallergenic. When it comes in contact with blood it expands slightly and converts to an adhesive gel that subsequently dissolves into glucose and saline. Because of its purity and the fact it simply degrades to these end products, it does not cause significant delay in healing as do other hemostatic materials that may have a similar appearance. Our HemoStyp gauze products are sold in different sizes for use in superficial trauma cases. It is also sold as a dental gauze and as a nasal dressing. Additional testing shows Hemostyp is 100% absorbable in one hour or less. Additionally, tests have been conducted to show the effectiveness of Hemostyp in Thoracic and Abdominal procedures. The Company continues to test for the effectiveness and the IFU for Abdominal and Thoracic Procedures.
 
HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is applied by simply folding the gauze once or twice, depending on the size of the wound, and then putting it as far into the wound as possible. Putting a bandage on top of the gauze is optional and in many cases unnecessary. On smaller cuts, it may be helpful to first cut the Gauze in half before applying it to the wound. When this is done, it may not be necessary to fold it first. Since EMS work is pre-hospital, rinsing the gauze out with saline or water is not necessary. This is because after the patient reaches the hospital, a wound will be debrided and possibly reopened prior to suturing.
 
The Company's hemostatic gauze product line includes various configurations. The Company's product line has been developed to address the specific needs of our market segments and our existing customers, including the U.S. military. The Company's hemostatic gauze product line now includes the following products:
 

· | Veterinary Market;

In February 2018, the Company completed and submitted to the FDA all materials relevant for the pre-market approval (“PMA”) for HemoStyp under the FDA’s new and innovative CtQ Pilot-Program as a Class III application for internal surgical procedures. The CtQ Pilot Program was created to identify products that have a chemical makeup of demonstrated safe interaction with the body –as evidenced by years of prior product usage and studies-- to be approved for Class III internal surgical use. The program’s intent is to allow products that have demonstrated repeated safe interaction to enter the market in a more efficient manner. The market for 2017 internal surgical market for hemostatic products is estimated at in excess of seven billion dollars, of that the estimated market size for ORC or similar products is estimated to be 2.7 Billion USD. The market is expected to grow at 7.1% annually over the next few years. Our strategy is to continue to seek out distributors for the internal medical device market in Europe now that the company has secured CE Class III designation and to actively seek a medical/Acquisition partner candidate.
 
Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products
 
The Company has established various contract manufacturing facilities to replace its original agreement with Hemo Manufacturing. All of these facilities have been vetted and have supplied multiple Quality Control program certificates and are registered FDA facilities. The facilities have been confirmed as part of our PMA submission and includes the FDA inspection records of these facilities. They are currently compliant and meet all the current standards required by the FDA
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
In September 2012, the Company announced that its hemostatic gauze products were granted patent protection by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which patent protection currently runs through 2029. However, if our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. Also, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing our patent in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products.
Competition
 
The disposable medical supply market in the United States is dominated by large companies such as Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson and 3M Company. Our hemostatic gauze product will directly compete in the gauze markets dominated by these majors. However, the market for hemostatic products, which includes gauzes, gels, bandages and powders, is largely composed of smaller, privately-held companies with the exception of Johnson & Johnson, which manufactures SurgicelÒ. In this market, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies.
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations. As a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products, we are subject to these laws and regulations. We must have all necessary licenses and other regulatory approvals and are required to be in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations. See “Recent Developments.”
 
In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (the "2007 Act") requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. These standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other technologies. The 2007 Act required the FDA to develop a standardized numerical identifier by April 1, 2010.
 
As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the healthcare delivery industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. Although there was substantial Federal legislation enacted during 2010 that impacted our healthcare system in the United States, we expect that the administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods in order to reform the healthcare system. Thus, we cannot predict the impact on us of the 2010 legislation and/or additional regulation governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare products that may be passed. Nor can we predict the impact on us of potential changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system, if any, when they may be adopted.
 
The costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our business activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to water, air, hazardous substances and wastes that may restrict or limit such business activities. Although the Company does not currently directly manufacture its own products, we may still be subject to existing environmental laws by way of regulatory agencies or other third party claimants. Examples of U.S. Federal environmental legislation that may have adverse effects on the Company include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Compensation and Liability Act (aka CERCLA or Superfund) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. By no means do we certify this list as being complete, as there are many laws and regulations that exist or that may come to pass that we cannot foresee that may also have an impact on the Company. The multitude of regulations issued by federal, state, provincial and local administrative agencies can be burdensome and costly and we determined to change our business model as a result. There are currently no pending legal proceedings with any government regulatory agencies.
