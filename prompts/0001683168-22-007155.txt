Item 1.  Business.
 
Worldwide Strategies Inc. is a digital health and fitness technology company that provides fitness experiences and solutions through a mobile application available on Apple iOS and Google Android devices. Our data-driven wellness platform allows people to set and track fitness and nutrition goals, integrates with wearable fitness devices and offers community features, enabling users to compete and support each other as they work towards achieving their personal fitness and wellness goals. We plan to develop our platform into a single destination for fitness and wellbeing, offering content and products to our users based on their specific needs on their personal health and wellness journey. 
 
Recent Developments
 
On October 22, 2022, we successfully terminated a license agreement for certain intellectual property we had previously licensed and had not been able to commercialize. In connection with the termination of the license we were able to cancel 90,000 shares of our issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and 1.2 million issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred stock; subsequent to the termination of the license agreement.
 
We successfully negotiated an amendment to our asset purchase agreement with Fitwell Limited, to remove the financing contingency and accelerate the closing of the purchase of the Fitwell assets. As of October 18, 2022, we successfully completed the purchase of the Fitwell assets, which includes a copy of the source code and data sets for a comprehensive health and fitness platform. In connection with the purchase of the Fitwell assets, we issued a promissory note for $0.5 million and issued 2 million shares of common stock as consideration for the purchase, and an additional 2.8 million shares for services rendered, and to be rendered in the future, for the benefit of the Company.
 
The net effect of canceling the license agreement and closing on the Fitwell asset purchase, was reverse dilution to the Company and its shareholders by 96 million shares of common stock and we believe the shift in strategy will allow for us to start generating revenue in the near term.
 
The Fitwell Software
 
We acquired a mobile fitness and wellness software platform which includes mobile apps native to the iOS and Android operating systems. The software enables video-based fitness curriculums, which provide beginner, intermediate and advanced cardiovascular and strength training programs, in easy to follow short-format instructional videos. We plan to enhance and improve the software, by i) adding fitness content, generated internally by fitness professionals which we plan to hire and through collaborations with fitness influencers, who we plan to work with to generate content and drive users to our platform, ii) segmenting users using artificial intelligence which will allow us to provide wellness content by user-group and demographic, iii) offering embedded e-commerce offerings of wellness products and services, iv) and eventually offer our mobile app users to book appointments at our planned brick and mortar locations, see Clinics; Preventative Care and Longevity, below.
 
Currently, content on our mobile app is available on a freemium model, with a small library of content offered for free, and unlimited access offered on a subscription basis. The platform also includes a comprehensive food library with meal and calorie tracking, a pedometer to track steps taken each day, artificial intelligence based coaching functionality, community-based features to provide peer based encouragement, and leaderboards to measure your progress against other users. The platform integrates with wearable fitness devices, such as the Apple Watch and aggregates and tracks collected health and fitness data. The app facilitates communication through push notifications as well as content and information features integrated seamlessly within the UX (user experience).
 
In addition to the feature rich experience, the platform provides for robust data capture and tracking which allows us to provide a highly customized user experience which is intended to maximize users’ fitness and wellness outcomes. We plan to leverage the source code and build on top of the existing platform a B2B wellness platform and market the platform to enterprise clients, data-mine the dataset for marketing opportunities, identify trends for new product launches and develop a DTC offering based on free content and micro-transactions.

Business to Business (“B2B”) Enterprise Level Wellness Solution
 
We believe that there is a need and demand within medium to large enterprise to offer to employees a comprehensive, real-time fitness and nutrition platform, that with employees opt-in can track an employee’s daily dietary consumption, through integrated food tracking in the app, activity tracking through integrated pedometers and apple health integration, through which we can track and monitor various biomedical data points. Based on individual inputs our algorithm can/will suggest an employee take a break, stretch, take a short walk, eat lunch, and or change tasks. Moreover, we can incentivize certain behaviors by issuing food vouchers/coupons through the app, recommending and pushing stretching or exercise routines through the app, and or calming and or meditative routines.
 
We believe that an employer’s adoption of a program that improves the lives, physical and mental health of their employees is a meaningful step in employee retention, boosting productivity, morale and meets an enterprises social governance objectives.
 
We would be able to provide employers with macro and micro data points, macro points would speak to the general well-being of their work force and segmented by operating divisions, we can track health, stress and the physical and cardiovascular well-being of employees. Through the platform we can identify best performers and laggards who are in need of additional support. We believe that a healthy work force will be more motivated, more productive and have less turnover, which are measurable metrics for companies and offer significant value.
 
Business to Consumer (“B2C”) and Direct to Consumer (“DTC”)
 
Part of our mobile app acquisition, includes a video based, in-gym workout program, with users being able to choose their workouts. Users may choose workouts based on intensity, muscle group and or trainer. Most fitness apps are subscription based, we plan to differentiate our offering by adding alternative methods for users to purchase content, beyond the basic freemium model. The trend in fitness applications is a subscription-based model, which we intend to offer, however we plan to offer micro transactions an additional option for users to consume content. Users will be able to pay a small charge to view a workout once in a 12-hour period, and or will be able to add the workout to their permanent in-app library for a slightly higher cost. We believe these micro-transactions are preferable for consumers who prefer to pay based on use, rather than on a hard-to-cancel monthly or annual subscription. We also plan to offer a library of free fitness content to onboard and engage users. The software collects user inputted data and data the user chooses to share with us. We intend to use this data to make personalized suggestions to improve a user’s health, fitness and well-being.
 
Clinics; Preventative Care and Longevity
 
We plan to offer a premium in-person clinic based experience, sold on a subscription basis, that would provide customers with access to cutting edge wellness and longevity treatments including but not limited to hyper and hypo -baric chambers, cryotherapy treatments, infrared sauna, as well as real-time bio data tracking, a dedicated medical team assigned to clients who offer personalized recommendations based on a client’s individual needs, based on their DNA, blood-based biomarkers, gut-biome, with adjustments being recommended as appropriate. We also plan to offer in-house and or facilitate for our clinic clients, regular preventative imagery and diagnostic scans, with the goal being to identify any medical complications early, where medical intervention has the highest likelihood of success.
 
Our services as it relates to medical imaging are preventative only, we do not offer any medical treatments. Users will be encouraged to consult with their primary care practitioners subsequent to any imaging performed. We believe that there is a segment of individuals who demand both longevity and wellness offerings with a view to maintaining good health using cutting edge tools as well as a subset of the population who want to be proactive in their personal care through regular screenings, including comprehensive blood panels and imagery. Subscription packages will provide unlimited access to services with the exception of biologics.
