ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Business Overview 
 
Nocera is a United States public company headquartered in Taiwan engaged in the manufacturing of aquaculture equipment, construction of aquaculture facilities, managing and operating aquaculture facilities and consulting for third party operators of aquaculture facilities. We provide land-based recirculation aquaculture systems (“RASs”) for fish farming. Our primary business operations consist of the design, development and production of RASs large scale fish tank systems, for fish farms along with expert consulting, technology transfer, and aquaculture project management services to new and existing aquaculture management business services.Corporate History
 
Nocera, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 1, 2002, and is based in New Taipei City, Taiwan.
 
Reverse Merger
 
Effective December 31, 2018, Nocera completed a reverse merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) with (i) GSI, (ii) GSI’s stockholders, Yin-Chieh (“Jeff”) Cheng and Zhang Bi, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of GSI (the “GSI Shares”) and (iii) GSI Acquisition Corp. Under the terms of the Agreement, the GSI Stockholders transferred to Nocera all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of Nocera’s common stock. As a result of the reverse merger, GSI became Nocera’s wholly-owned subsidiary and Mr. Cheng and Zhang Bi, the former stockholders of GSI, became Nocera’s controlling stockholders. The share exchange transaction with GSI was treated as a reverse merger, with GSI as the accounting acquirer and Nocera as the acquired party. GSI is a limited company established under the laws and regulations of Hong Kong on August 1, 2014 and is a holding company without any assets or operations.
 
In anticipation of the reverse merger, GSI undertook a reorganization and became the 100% holding company of Guizhou Grand Smooth Technology Ltd (“GZ GST”) and GSI Guizhou Wan Feng Hu Intelligent Aquatic Technology Co. Limited (“GZ WFH”), which were all controlled by the same stockholders before and after the reorganization, pursuant to a series of contractual agreements (the “GZ WFH VIE Agreements”). As a result, GSI, through GZ GST, was determined to be the primary beneficiary of GZ WFH and GZ WFH became a variable interest entity of GSI. Accordingly, GSI consolidated GZ WFH’s operations, assets and liabilities.
 
GZ WFH was incorporated in Xingyi City, Guizhou Province, People’s Republic of China (PRC) on October 25, 2017, and was engaged in providing fish farming containers service, which integrated sales, installments, and maintenance of aquaculture equipment.
 
Divestiture of GZ WFH 
 
On September 21, 2020, Nocera terminated its relationship with GZ WFH and its management, and the GZ WFH Agreements between the parties were terminated as well.
 
Subsequently on October 8, 2020, Zhang Bi and GZ WFH entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with the Company wherein all claims as to GZ WFH’s debt (claim to shares in Nocera or GZ GST) were compromised, settled, and otherwise resolved as to any and all claims or causes of action whatsoever against Nocera for any matter, action, or representation as to Nocera, and any debt to ownership of Nocera or GZ GST up to the date of the settlement agreement. The consideration for the settlement agreement was mutual waiver of any and all claims against each other and GZ GST, and GZ WFH (including Zhang Bi) waived any claims to Nocera stock, and the 4,750,000 shares of common stock of Nocera owned by Zhang Bi were cancelled.

The VIE Agreements with XFC
 
On December 31, 2020, Nocera exchanged 700,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock to stockholders of Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd,. a Taiwan limited liability company (“XFC”), in exchange for 100% controlling interest in XFC. 
 
 On December 31, 2020, Nocera and XFC, a domestic funded limited liability company registered in Taiwan (R.O.C.), entered into a series of contractual agreements whereby Nocera agreed to provide technical consulting and related services to XFC. As a result, Nocera has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of XFC, and XFC became a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of Nocera.
 
The VIE structure was adopted mainly because we engage in business in an industry that prohibits foreign investment (e.g., construction) and of which requires special licenses in Taiwan. We are not currently planning to engage in business in mainland China or Hong Kong, and as a result, we are not currently required to obtain any special licenses in mainland China or Hong Kong. Nocera has entered into the following contractual arrangements with a stockholder of XFC, that enable the Company to (1) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affects the economic performance of XFC, and (2) receive the economic benefits of XFC that could be significant to XFC. The Company is fully and exclusively responsible for the management of XFC, assumes all of the risk of losses of XFC and has the exclusive right to exercise all voting rights of XFC’s stockholder. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 810 “Consolidation,” the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of XFC and has consolidated XFC’s assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
XFC will shift focus to support the construction activities of RASs fish farms of our clients and the development of the Company-owned and operated fish farms.
 
Corporate Structure
 
We conduct our operations through (i) XFC; and (ii) Nocera Taiwan Branch, an unincorporated division of the Company (“NTB”). The Company’s other subsidiaries, GSI, which wholly-owns GZ GST, are dormant and currently do not have any operations. However, GZ GST may be involved with RASs manufacturing in the near future.
 


We acquired GSI in a reverse merger on December 31, 2018. Prior to the merger, we were a “shell company” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act). GSI is the parent holding company of GZ GST, which was incorporated on November 13, 2018, as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in the PRC. Both GSI and GZ GZT are currently dormant and do not conduct any operations. The Company currently does not conduct any operations in China or Hong Kong.
 
In December 2020, Nocera added XFC as a VIE. Under the laws of Taiwan, foreign investments are typically restricted or prohibited with respect to the operation of certain businesses in Taiwan (e.g., construction). As a result, it was necessary for us to add XFC as a VIE in order to obtain a Class A construction license to construct indoor RASs and solar sharing fish farms. Without this license, we would not be able to conduct this critical part of our business in Taiwan. XFC has obtained a Class A construction license in Taiwan and we plan to use XFC for the investment in, and the construction of, indoor RASs and solar sharing fish farms. The Company is now looking for opportunities to expand into the U.S. by building fish farms or transforming existing ones into high-tech and solar sharing enterprises.
 
NTB was established on January 14, 2021 in Taiwan. In October 2021, Nocera began its eel trading business in response to domestic demands created by the COVID-19 lockdown. NTB currently procures and sells eel in Taiwan and plans to trade other types of seafood, such as tilapia and milkfish, in the near future. 
 
Significant Products & Services
 
The Company manufactures, sells, and installs RASs for land-based fish farms. Originally, our systems were designed and constructed from used marine shipping containers. The Company then developed its next generation of RASs, a cylindrical shaped tank that holds approximately 15,000 U.S. gallons of water, which the Company believes make them among the largest systems in the market.

There are several significant benefits to our RASs:
 

· | the system provides a controlled and “traceable” environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | the recirculating aquaculture system can be installed almost anywhere and requires minimal site preparation; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | it benefits local economies by providing fresher and, therefore, generally healthier fish.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Nocera’s RASs include the fish tank, circulation and filtration systems.
 

Nocera Land-based RASs Overview 
----------------------------------
Height / width | 1.5m/10m 
Main composition of our tank | Environmental-friendly PE
Yield per growing season (Tilapia) | 11,000 lbs. 
Fish farming density | 100-109 lb./m3 
Price per RASs Total Solution | $35,000 USD 

 
The Company’s RASs can raise both freshwater and saltwater fish, as well as a variety of crustaceans. 
 
Nocera Recirculating Aquaculture System 
 


The Company also provides consulting services to aquaculture projects, where we offer design innovation and RAS expertise to increase revenue, while decreasing operating expenses, allowing clients to operate more efficiently while increasing production. Additionally, we show clients how to operate more strategically by diversifying the species of fish raised to meet market demands. Our equipment enhances the management of fish farms by reducing the incidence of disease among the fish populations, while reducing water pollution from inland fish farms.

Market Overview
 
Global fish consumption has long been on the rise at a rate higher than any other source of animal protein, and the trend is expected to continue. With overfishing already threatening the earth’s marine ecosystem, it is anticipated that a significantly larger proportion of fish consumption would be farm-raised instead of wild-caught in the future.
 
Also, the trade conflict between the U.S. and China has led to a greater demand for non-Chinese origin seafood products from the U.S. market.
 
On a broader perspective, as the world rapidly begins a transition towards net zero carbon emissions in response to the ever-more pressing threat of climate change, it is foreseeable that solar energy will be the go-to option for many countries as a new source of green energy.
 
We believe that the RASs, with its proven advantage in producing more fish in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner while offering greater location flexibility and the potential for a “solar-fish sharing mode,” is a perfect solution to address the opportunities highlighted above.

Consulting Services
 
We also provide consulting services and solutions for aquaculture projects. We currently provide such services in Taiwan and intend to expand into other international markets and the United States to increase revenues and operate more efficiently. Our consultants use their RASs expertise to help customers increase production and operate more strategically by branching into new diversified aquaculture species, and importantly, reducing water pollution and decreasing the disease problems of fisheries.
 
The Company plans to provide the following service offerings:
 

· | for qualified investors or investment groups who are interested in capitalizing on the potential of the aquaculture industry and want to develop or take part in commercial fish farming or shrimp farming but lack the experience, design, installation, build and management of aquaculture projects to meet these interests;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a full range of pilot and management services to aquaculture companies and new aquaculture projects throughout Taiwan and potentially the rest of the world, providing tailored solutions to meet customer needs and to fulfill our commitment, to encourage and support clean water and clean fish products from the fish farm to the table; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | select equipment and materials from suppliers to provide unique service offerings structured to generate higher profit margins.

Strategy
 
We plan to focus on countries with a growing population and growing demand for food. By 2050, we will need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s growing population1. There is a growing need for new ways to produce high-quality local fish without putting more pressure on our natural ecosystems. Like Taiwan, there are also many countries with a growing population and growing demand for high-protein food. We plan to go global through building demo sites promoting our RASs and selling our price-competitive systems in these countries to meet their demand for food and to satisfy their desire for a greener environment.
 
In January 2021, we moved our operation and market focus from China to Taiwan. In 2021, we established a Nocera Taiwan Branch to focus on customers in a variety of sectors, such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies, and international customers. We have received interest from areas like Japan, Thailand, Jordan, South Africa and the United States.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net sales were approximately $9.9 million and approximately $1.2 million, respectively.
 
Construction Services
 
Nocera is the only provider of RAS solar power energy sharing and construction services in Taiwan. In 2021, Nocera acquired XFC to support the construction activities for the clients of Nocera and develop Taiwan fish farm segmentation.
Customers
 
In 2021, we intend to target customers in a variety of markets (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Jordan, South Africa and the United States), such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies and other types of international customers. In addition, an increasing amount of Chinese state and local offices are faced with environmental challenges in public waters and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce water pollution, so our potential target customers are significant. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net sales were approximately $9.9 million and approximately $1.2 million, respectively.

Suppliers
 
We intend to purchase raw materials and parts and equipment from third parties locally in Taiwan and build and sell them to customers. We are not directly involved in the production or manufacturing of readily available equipment, and we do not take a risk in the repair and maintenance of the equipment because of the manufacturer’s maintenance policy. We have identified and sourced multiple suppliers in Taiwan, and our relationships with suppliers are generally good. We expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our needs, particularly as we ramp up our expansion into the U.S. and other markets around the world.
Competition
 
The market for aquaculture projects and services is highly competitive. Many of the producers and sellers are large entities that have significantly greater resources than we have. Therefore, we signed VIE contracts to partner with XFC to use their local resources in Taixi township, Taiwan (R.O.C.) to develop land-based RAS fish farms in Taiwan and hopefully gain more of a competitive advantage. We also compete with small suppliers which provide smaller alternative aquaculture solutions regionally but due to the size of our projects, we believe that we should have a better price point.
Trademarks and Patents
 
None.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Nocera intends to create a brand and by its creation of the brand, offer unique and better incentives to the consumers. Our target market is not only limited to the direct processing plants; instead, consumers will be informed about the uniqueness of the fish product, and the important health benefits of fish protein.
 
Further, Nocera plans to increase the species selection and product form through the investment of the additional 500 tanks; among all we plan to build a hatchery system by collaborating with professionals to promote and maintain healthy, self-sustaining populations of fish and other aquatic species. We are aiming for the direct wholesale option, including live hauling, restaurants, supermarkets and specialty stores. More importantly, the distribution channel will move towards online marketing as well to achieve a greater market share.
 
Manufacturing Operations
 
Currently, the Company manufactures RASs through its branch office in Taiwan and may manufacture RASs through its Chinese subsidiaries. Additionally, Nocera provides consulting services regarding RAS technology transfer and aquaculture project management services to the customers in Taiwan.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in Taiwan and throughout the world, including, without limitation, those related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
 
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was legal at the time it occurred.

We are also subject to laws regulating consumer products in the jurisdictions in which we sell our products. In the United States for instance, certain of our products are subject to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Act, under which the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission may exclude products from the market that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, require repair, replacement or refund of products, impose fines for noncompliance with requirements and impose fines for failure to timely notify them of potential safety hazards.
 
Also, with respect to the potential sale of eel and any other seafood into the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program impacts how food is grown, packed, processed, shipped and imported into the United States and it governs compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, and criminal sanctions, any of which could impact our results of operations.
 
In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on the labels of food products.
 
Our operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.
 
We are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
We are also subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health, and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. 
 
Our business depends in part on environmental regulations and programs of Taiwan that promote cleaner water sources to restore clean water back to people. Our customers may be encouraged with incentives by the local governments relating to aquaculture investment. The approvals of land, licenses or permits, are required from relevant central and local government authorities. In addition, from time to time, relevant government authorities may impose new regulations at a local level regulating fish farming. We believe that we have skills to help our customers obtain all necessary licenses, registrations and permits to comply with all requirements necessary to allow our customers and investors to conduct aquaculture business in Taiwan.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
Property
 
We do not own any real property.

Seasonality
 
Since the global growing demand from aquaculture production along with the decreasing production from wild fisheries and our fish farming systems provide a controlled and traceable environment for species, our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact.
