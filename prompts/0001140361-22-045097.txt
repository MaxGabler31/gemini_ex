Industry and Competitive Environment
The Company believes its products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance and marketing support and, to a lesser extent, price.

The Company’s competitors in the commercial tent market include Anchor Industries® and Aztec Tents for tension, frame and canopy tents.  Competition in the commercial tent business is based on price, quality, structure, styling, ease of installation and technical support.

Such supply contracts can be for commercial off-the-shelf products in addition to products required to be built to unique specifications.  Competitors in the military tent business include HDT®, Alaska Structures®, Camel, Outdoor Venture, and Diamond Brand.

The Company’s main competitors in this market are Hobie Cat®, Pelican International Inc., Wenonah Canoe, Jackson Kayak and Legacy Paddlesports™, each of which competes on the basis of their product’s design, performance, quality and price.
Diving:  The main competitors in the Diving segment include Aqua Lung®, Suunto®, Atomic Aquatics, Oceanic, Cressi and Mares®.  Competitive advantage in the life support product category of this segment, which consists of regulators, dive computers, and buoyancy compensators, is a function of product innovation, performance, quality and safety. Competition in the general diving product category of fins, masks, snorkels and wetsuits is characterized by low barriers to entry and numerous competitors who compete on the basis of product innovation, performance, quality and price.
Backlog
Unfilled orders for future delivery of products varies as a result of numerous factors impacting the Company (including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” below) and because of the non-binding nature of such orders, the Company does not believe that backlog information is material to the understanding of its business.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
At September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 1,500 regular, full-time employees, of which approximately 1,200 were employed in the United States and approximately 300 were employed outside of the United States. Approximately 55 or 4% were represented by a collective bargaining agreement, all of whom are located at our facilities in Batam, Indonesia. In recent years, we have not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages, or other labor disruptions. The Company considers its employee relations to be excellent. Temporary employees are utilized primarily to manage peaks in the seasonal manufacturing of products.
The Company remains committed to areas of work place safety, product quality and customer satisfaction. Successful execution of our mission is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team, as well as providing competitive pay and benefits.
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
The Company holds patents for various of the products it sells and regularly files applications for patents.  The Company has numerous trademarks and trade names which it considers important to its business, many of which are noted in this report. Historically, the Company has vigorously defended its intellectual property rights and expects to continue to do so.
Supply Chain and Sourcing of Materials
The Company manufactures some products that use parts or materials that, due to geographical distance, limited supplier capacity or availability or competing demands for such parts or materials, are only available in a cost effective manner from a single vendor or require the Company to place orders several months in advance of required delivery.
Historically, the Company attempted to mitigate product availability and these supply chain risks when possible through the purchase of safety stock, use of forecast-based supply contracts, and, to a lesser extent, with just in time inventory deliveries or supplier-owned inventory located close to the Company’s manufacturing locations.  In doing so, the Company strived to balance the businesses’ need to maintain adequate inventory levels with the cost of holding such inventory by manufacturing to forecast for high volume products, utilizing build-to-order strategies wherever possible, and by having contract-manufactured products delivered to customers directly from the supplier.  The Company also seeks to manage its inventory through on-going product design and logistical initiatives with its suppliers to reduce lead times.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries, including those in which the Company operates. While the Company expects that these supply chain disruptions will continue into fiscal 2023, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to manage its supply chain and meet consumer demand for its products. Supply chain disruptions are dynamic and may impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product or the Company’s ability to fill demand for its products, especially given the volatility and changing circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic environment. 
Seasonality
The Company’s products in each of its business segments are primarily warm-weather, outdoor recreation-related, which has historically resulted in seasonal variations in sales and profitability for the Company. This seasonal variability was traditionally due to customers’ increasing their inventories in the quarters ending March and June, which is the typical primary selling season for the Company’s outdoor recreation products, with lower inventory volumes during the quarters ending September and December. 
Due to the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company’s primary-selling season during fiscal 2020 was interrupted resulting in a significant shift in sales volumes during the 2020 fiscal year toward the last fiscal quarter of that year versus the typical primary selling season which usually occurs during the second and third fiscal quarters, as noted above. During fiscal years 2021 and 2022, as described above under "Supply Chain and Sourcing of Materials," the Company was impacted by supply chain disruptions that impacted sales and operating profit towards the latter half of fiscal 2022. Accordingly, because of the ongoing supply chain disruption and the current macroeconomic conditions (including related to rising prices and inflationary conditions), the Company cannot predict at this time whether it will experience typical seasonality in demand for its products during fiscal 2023 and beyond.
Typically and prior to the impact of COVID-19 as noted above, the Company had mitigated the seasonality of its businesses somewhat by encouraging customers to purchase and take delivery of products more evenly through the year.  The following table shows, for the past three fiscal years, the total consolidated net sales and operating profit or loss of the Company for each quarter, as a percentage of the total year. See “Coronavirus (COVID-19)” in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s seasonality for fiscal 2021 and 2022.
