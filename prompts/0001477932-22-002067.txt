Business Overview

Industry Background/Hemp Processing

There is a shortage of hemp processing facilities in Wisconsin and other States, in our management’s opinion, causing delays and failure to meet farmers’ processing demands. During 2019, 850 growers planted and successfully harvested about 5,000 acres of biomass (Source: DATCP’s Plant Industry Bureau http://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/News_Media/2020HempAppsOpen.aspx.). Currently, there is not enough processing capacity to handle 5,000 acres of biomass in Wisconsin, causing farmers to truck their Biomass to other States, primarily to Colorado. Processing crops in an efficient and expeditious manner generally, including biomass, is essential to any Hemp farming operation because the harvest will increasingly dry out over time, lose potency and the value of the crops will decline with each passing day. As such, farmers will benefit from an efficient and timely process involving sale of their crops to a processor or relying upon the services of a processor or engaging or entering into agreements with Co-ops to process hemp as the hemp crops are harvested. This provides benefits to farmers by improving their product margins from timely processing of hemp, which is currently underserved since most farmers cannot afford to have dedicated processing facilities. Additionally, farmers will have a local place to sell their Biomass if they so choose rather than paying for processing, without fear of tariffs being placed on their crops. 

With the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) l, Tetrahydrocannabinols (“THC”) from hemp have been excepted (removed) from illegal drug or controlled substances under Schedule I by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (signed into law on December 20, 2018) and are not included in any other schedule of controlled substances set forth in 21 U.S.C. §813. Accordingly, there are less regulatory impediments to growing and processing Hemp, notwithstanding that the most significant regulation is that the THC concentration in a Hemp Product must be less than 0.3 percent THC concentration. 

Our Future Hemp Processing Business

In February 2019, we were approved in Wisconsin to grow and process hemp pursuant to our obtaining an Industrial Hemp Grower License and an Industrial Hemp Processor License, both licenses of which were renewed on April 15, 2021. 

Apart from our Plan of Operations and sourcing the equipment needed to operate a plant capable of initially processing one acre per day that can be expanded to processing three to five acres per day and locating our sources of equipment and sales of our Cannabidiol (“CBD”) or Isolate product derived from Hemp, we have engaged in nominal operations. CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the resinous flower of Cannabis. We plan to obtain raw material Hemp, referred to as Biomass, by purchasing it from growers in Wisconsin, Oregon, or California. We will process the biomass into CBD or isolate product by renting a facility and purchasing the necessary processing equipment or establishing our processing facility at a Wisconsin farm that we acquire. We plan to sell our processed CBD or isolate to manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies for their manufacture, distribution and sale of edibles for human consumption, such as cookies, candies, crystal pop, honey and multi-vitamins, and topical products for human use such as oils, tinctures, creams, oils and salves, and vaping liquids. We will conduct our business and sell our products only in States and countries where it is legal to do so under State and/or applicable country laws and regulations. We will undergo significant development to accomplish the foregoing as detailed in our Plan of Operations beginning at page 47.

Products that are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body are considered drugs under the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and distribution of food, dietary supplements, drugs, cosmetic, medical devices, biologics, and tobacco products. Our CBD or isolate will not be formulated, marketed, or make any claims as drugs and/or products requiring FDA approval. 

Anticipated Apparel Business – Consolidated Apparel, Inc. 

On December 13, 2021, our subsidiary, Integrated Holding Solutions, Inc. (“IHS” or the “Buyer”) executed an Acquisition Agreement with Consolidated Apparel, Inc. (“Consolidated” or the “Seller’)) and its sole owner, Eugene Caiazzo (“Caiazzo”), which rescinded our prior September 1, 2021 Agreement for acquiring 49% of Consolidated and provided for ’is' acquisition of 100% of Consolidated in return for the Seller’s consideration to the Buyer of 328,000 shares of our Convertible/Redeemable Series B par value $1.00 Preferred shares to Caiazzo, which shares have yet to be issued. As such, the Consolidated acquisition has not yet closed. Upon closing : (a) Caiazzo shall remain as Consolidated’s President and manage Consolidated’s operations; (b) we will appoint Caiazzo as a member of our Board of Directors; (c) IHS and Caiazzo will complete an Employment Agreement providing for Caiazzo’s responsibilities as Consolidated’s President; (d) subject to negotiation between the Parties, we will grant cashless stock options to Caiazzo. 

Consolidated provides short and long runs of customized Performance Apparel, operating within the Athleisure market space. Our principal business activities through Consolidated after closing will be the development, marketing and distribution of customized Performance Apparel using Consolidated’s dba branded names, Native Outfitters and Incite Performance Wear.

Where You Can Find Us

Our principal executive office and mailing address and phone number are: 6810 North State Road 7, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073, (954) 906-0098.

Shell Company Status

We are a shell company, and we are designated a Shell Company Risk by OTCMARKETS.

Our Filing Status as a “Smaller Reporting Company”

We are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company after this offering if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time, we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”);
· | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
· | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 


4


We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Prospectus, which are also available to us as a “smaller reporting company” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements contained in this Form S-1 may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. The existing scaled executive compensation disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies will continue to apply to our filings so long as we are an emerging growth company, regardless of whether we remain a “smaller reporting company”.

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

BUSINESS

Hemp Growing Business

We plan to process Hemp or biomass that we will acquire or establishing a processing plant in Wisconsin. We will have both an Industrial Hemp Grower License and an Industrial Hemp Processor License in Wisconsin. From our processing activities, we plan to generate revenue from selling the processed material in the form of CBD or isolate to manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies for their manufacture, distribution and sale of CBD related products such as edibles for human consumption, vitamins, and multi-vitamins, and topical products for human use such as oils, tinctures, creams, oils and salves, and vaping liquids. We have not yet begun our operations. We have specific development steps to accomplish our business and strategic objectives as detailed in our Plan of Operations beginning at page 47, including: 

· | Purchasing processing equipment 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Hiring processing personnel, including a processing plant manager/operator
· | Training for processing personnel 
· | Market sales of isolate, CBD via social media, contacting CBD companies 


We also plan to promote and assist in the establishment of a co-op with local farmers for the purpose of establishing a consistent supply of Biomass and enter into long term supply contracts. Purchasers are looking for high grade isolate in large quantities and are willing to enter into long term purchase contracts of 12 months or more for at least 10 liter or more per month. 

Business Strategy

We plan to capitalize on the shortage of processing capabilities in the biomass industry by concentrating our efforts in three states; Wisconsin, Colorado and Florida, where there is a lack of capabilities that can facilitate the processing of large fields, which we believe is the key to sustainable growth for both farmers and processors. Our focus is sustainable revenues from operations by securing agreements or arrangements with Co-Operative Farming arrangements and/or with local farmers growing Hemp. We will use these agreements to show our ability to fulfill long term supply agreements.

Website

We currently have no website but expect to complete a website by May 1, 2022 at agpk.org. None of the information in that website will be incorporated into any of our SEC filings. 
Revenue Generation

We plan to generate our revenues primarily from biomass processing within 120 days of securing funding from our lab and processing facility allowing us to begin processing Biomass to sell as Isolate of Oil. 
Estimated Market Growth

Research and Markets issued a new report on the United States Cannabidiol (CBD) Market 2020-2024 (Business Wire October 29, 2020 https://tinyurl.com/ycmltzrn). The U.S. cannabidiol market is estimated to reach US$13.39 billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 42.36% for the period spanning 2020-2024. 

The growth of the market has been driven by a growing incidence of Alzheimer’s disease, upsurge in healthcare expenditure, rising depression rate, increasing geriatric population, mounting online retail sales and expanding urbanization. However, growth of the market would be challenged by the high cost of CBD products and side effects associated with CBD products. 

Some of the noteworthy trends of the market include increasing prevalence of arthritis, rising adoption among millennials, the surging occurrence of chronic disorders and upswing in sports injuries. 

The Hemp-derived segment is the fastest-growing market, owing to the massive growth in the healthcare industry across the region, rising number of research findings and the discovery of new therapeutic applications, increase in awareness regarding the benefits of cannabidiol based products, growing application of cannabidiol in food, pharma, and cosmetics.

Target Markets

Our target markets are hemp farmers and co-ops.

Competitive Advantages


· | Our Chief Executive Officer has experience in successfully growing 15 acres, harvesting, and setting up a licensed processing facility (the facility is in California for THC), which we will use to avoid the pitfalls and missteps of most startups
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We have existing contacts within the Cannabis/CBD space to potentially sell products 
· | We plan to use efficient and quality processing with the goal to extract good quality products. 

Competitive Disadvantages 

Most of our competitors will have: 


· | Greater operational, financial, and physical resources than we do.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Existing processing capabilities. 
· | Have a foothold in the CBD Isolate market. 

Intellectual Property

We have no registered patents, trademarks or other intellectual property.

Research and Development

Since our inception, we have not spent any funds on research and development.


7

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers

We do not expect that we will be dependent upon one or a few major customers or that any one customer will account for more than 10% of our revenues.
Environmental Law

Environmental law effecting farmers is the plants must be tested by the applicable state to ensure the THC level is at or below 0.30 (Wisconsin) or the applicable percentage in the respective state. Should this THC level change pursuant to applicable state regulations, this may have a material impact upon farmers growing hemp. Other environmental impacts may include cross contamination, bugs, or use of toxic fertilizers, any one of which could potentially destroy an entire crop.
Employees and Chief Executive Officer Employment Agreement

Our only employee is Matthew Dwyer, our Chief Executive Officer. We have a January 1, 2018 Employment Agreement with Matthew Dwyer to be our Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 at the following fixed salaries; (a) January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 - $180,000; (b) January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 - $300,000; and (c) January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 - $500,000. As additional compensation, Matthew Dwyer, we are required to grant 150,000,000 stock options on the first day of each calendar year beginning January 1, 2018, which options are exercisable at $0.01, and may be exercised for a period of 5 years. A letter agreement that Matthew Dwyer amends the Employment Agreement as follows: (a) accrued wages for 2017, 2018, 2019 are reduced to a total of $50,000; (b) effective December 31, 2019, salary for 2020 is reduced to $180,000; and (c) effective December 31, 2019, all options either granted or not shall be cancelled and all 150,000,000 options shall no longer be issued. We and Matthew Dwyer executed an Amendment to extend the Employment Agreement to December 31, 2021, providing that the Salary would remain the same as 2020, which was $180,000 with no option grants.

Contingent upon successful funding and the level of such financing taking into consideration other business needs, we may hire a Chief Operating Officer, manager of the processing operations, and one office support staff.

Seasonality of Business

Seasonality does not materially affect our business since we are able to acquire Biomass from other parts of the country to process. There are limitations as the hemp growth cycle is limited to one plant a year outdoors.

Patents/Trademarks/Franchises

We have no patents, trademarks or franchise agreements. 

Licenses 

Industrial Hemp Grower License

On February 28, 2019, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection issued us an Industrial Hemp Grower License. This license does not expire but requires an annual registration renewal, which renewal we applied for on December 31, 2019 to renew for another one-year period. This license permits us to grow any amount of hemp in Wisconsin, including hemp starter plants (“seedlings”) with a delta-9-THC concentration of 0.3 percent of less in all parts of the plant when it has been dried. 
Industrial Hemp Processor License

On February 28, 2019, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection issued us an Industrial Hemp Processor License. This license does not expire but requires an annual registration renewal, which renewal we applied for on December 31, 2019 to renew for another one-year period. This license permits us to process industrial hemp including transporting, warehousing and converting the industrial hemp to a marketable form. A processor license is also needed if you will be packaging and labeling raw industrial hemp for retail sale. As a Processor, we are able to accept hemp from out of state growers so long as the plants have a delta-9-THC concentration of 0.3 percent of less in all parts of the plant when it has been dried. 

Sources and Availability of Products

Our main source of Biomass will be Wisconsin. In 2018, there was 5,000 acres planted by 850 growers (site source). Oregon and California may also be a source of Biomass.

Raw Materials

Our raw materials consist of Hemp or Biomass.

Federal Cannabis Related Regulations

Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.

In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. The new administration under President Trump could decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. See Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement discussed below. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. We may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government.

We may also be subject to several other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. They anticipate that our licensees and vendors will be required to manufacture our products in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and will be subject to regulations relating to employee safety, working conditions, protection of the environment, and other items. The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry and recreational marijuana. Changes in laws, rules and regulations or the recall of any product by a regulatory authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents which would include the so-called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directs all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The DOJ asserts this return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs.

“It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “Therefore, today’s memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.”
