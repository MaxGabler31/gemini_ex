Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Today, the U.S. spends approximately $4 trillion per year on healthcare. About 90% of that spending is for the treatment of chronic diseases. The majority of chronic diseases are caused predominantly by behaviors, including cardiometabolic diseases ("CMDx"), such as diabetes and heart disease. The root causes of CMDx are behaviors relating to diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors, yet current treatments are focused on reducing the effects of those diseases rather than addressing the root causes.
 Better Therapeutics, Inc. (the "Company", "we", or "us") is developing a platform of FDA-regulated, software-based, PDT candidates for treating diabetes, heart disease, and other cardiometabolic conditions. Our PDTs are designed to deliver a novel form of CBT that can enable changes in neural pathways of the brain so that lasting changes in behavior become possible. We believe addressing the underlying causes of these diseases has the potential to dramatically improve patient health and lower healthcare costs.
 In March 2022, we announced primary endpoint data from our pivotal trial of our lead product candidate, BT-001, an investigational PDT platform that is designed to use digitally delivered Nutritional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ("nCBT") to treat type 2 diabetes.
Inadequacies of the Current Treatment Paradigm
 The U.S. has arrived at a massive, worsening, and unsustainable healthcare crisis. The prevalence of CMDx and U.S. healthcare spending have trended upwards over half a century. A crisis this large is not the result of only one factor such as heredity. The advent of digital entertainment, changes in the food we eat, and other social determinants have all played a role.
 

U.S. Healthcare Spending and Prevalence of CMDx
 


The use of prescription drugs to treat CMDx can provide symptomatic relief and, in some cases, control the progression of disease. However, medications generally do not address root causes, which are predominantly behavioral. There is clear consensus in the scientific and medical community that poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors drive the onset, co-morbidity and mortality associated with CMDx. Just three CMDx, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, account for more than $100 billion in annual prescription drug spending in the United States, none of which addresses root causes.
 An estimated 34 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes. Another estimated 88 million people in the United States have prediabetes, 70% of which are expected to develop into type 2 diabetes during their lifetimes. The annual direct medical costs in the United States for treating type 2 diabetes exceeded $237 billion in 2017, representing an increase of $61 billion since 2012. These costs are forecasted to increase to $472 billion by 2030.
 Despite advances in pharmacological treatment, about half of U.S. patients with type 2 diabetes are not achieving glycemic control. Even when adequate glycemic control is achieved via pharmacotherapy, a substantially elevated risk due to all-cause mortality still exists. According to American Diabetes Association, the behavioral determinants of type 2 diabetes are a significant contributor to both poor glycemic control and mortality risk.
 The role of behaviors, including dietary pattern and exercise, in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions is well established. These behavioral determinants are resistant to change because they are created and reinforced by strong social norms and culturally reinforced ideas. The use of CBT to directly target these behaviors is a critically important means of achieving high-quality CMDx care. Unfortunately for patients, the U.S. health system is not organized to provide comprehensive CBT at the scale needed. While clinical guidelines consistently recommend that healthcare providers facilitate behavioral changes, they often do not have the ability to provide or prescribe effective behavioral therapy to their patients.
 Accordingly, significant unmet needs remain in the therapeutic treatment of CMDx and in the control of associated healthcare spending. We believe that to address this problem, we must focus on root causes and address the near-complete absence to date of behavior-modifying therapeutics for CMDx.

Our Solution
  We have created a platform for the creation of PDTs, essentially software delivered as a mobile application, that is designed to use CBT to address the underlying causes of CMDx.
 CBT is a treatment paradigm originally developed for the management of psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Traditional CBT aims to correct behavioral responses to a situation that are either non-productive or have adverse effects (maladaptive behaviors) by identifying and changing the core beliefs that produced them. It has since been successfully applied to a wide range of chronic conditions, including CMDx, and has been observed to be generally well-tolerated and to have the potential to provide durable treatment effects, either alone or in combination with other therapies. In current practice, CBT represents a family of therapies that have evolved over several decades and include modalities such as acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
 nCBT, our solution to the crisis described above, is a novel form of behavioral therapy developed by us for patients with type 2 diabetes and other CMDx. nCBT is an adaptation of CBT that is designed specifically to address the cognitive patterns and mental structures that drive dietary patterns and associated lifestyle behaviors.
 nCBT builds on traditional CBT by systematically targeting the cognitive structures, behavioral routines, emotional patterns and coping skills that underlie culturally specific eating behaviors. The content and delivery mechanisms of nCBT were developed internally from first principles, leveraging experience from clinician and health coach-patient interactions to distill common maladaptive thinking and beliefs pertaining to diet and lifestyle. It is designed as a digitally delivered therapy so that it can be widely disseminated to large patient populations yet personalized to the individual patient using artificial intelligence (AI)-driven feedback loops.
 Our PDTs enable the delivery of nCBT at scale to fill this critical gap in care. To be widely adopted, we believe an effective PDT needs to be prescribed by healthcare providers and reimbursed by payers like a traditional prescription medication. This allows a digital therapeutic to leverage and bolster the trust established in a patient-provider relationship and to provide actionable data back to both provider and patient that can help advance care.
 In a pilot study of our lead product candidate, BT-001, we observed that use of BT-001 resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control, based on the generally accepted view that the lowering of HbA1c value by 0.4 is significant. The mean decrease in fasting blood glucose of -22.9 mg/dL corresponds to approximately a 1.0% reduction in hemoglobin A1c, ("A1c"). A1c is a measure of the average blood sugar over a two-to-three-month period. Fasting blood glucose and A1c are both used to diagnose diabetes and to determine whether treatment is effective. An A1c reduction of 1.0% has been associated with a 21% decrease in diabetes related mortality and a 40% reduction in microvascular complications in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study with long-term follow up. Microvascular complications due to diabetes include blindness, damage to nerves in feet that results in pain and numbness, and damage to kidneys that results in chronic kidney disease and failure.
 We enrolled the first patient into a potentially pivotal study in April 2021 and completed enrollment of 669 patients in November 2021. The virtual aspects of the trial include recruitment of participants using email and social media and using telemedicine visits. Participants were randomized to receive standard of care with or without BT-001. We announced primary endpoint data from our clinical trial of BT-001 in March 2022. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change from baseline in A1c after 90 days of treatment between the two groups and showed highly statistically significant improvement in A1c between the intervention and control groups (-0.4%, p <0.001). Clinically meaningful changes (A1c reductions of 0.4% or more) occurred in 42.7% of the group receiving standard of care and BT-001 versus 25.4% in the group receiving standard of care alone (difference of 17.3%, p <0.001). We believe this demonstrates that the use of BT-001 significantly improved A1c compared to standard of care alone. The six-month trial is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Given the compelling benefit-to-risk profile of BT-001 and highly statistically significant 0.4% reduction in A1c, we intend to file a de novo classification request with the FDA upon completion of the trial.

Our PDTs are designed to be used by patients under the guidance of their primary care provider and may fill an important gap in existing clinical guidelines. Our first PDT candidate, BT-001, is intended to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes by targeting the behaviors that are root causes, with the potential for patients’ physicians to ultimately reduce or eliminate over time the ongoing need for prescription medications to manage these chronic diseases. With a goal of pursuing commercialization first in type 2 diabetes, we see a compelling opportunity to quickly and efficiently leverage our therapeutics platform to create additional PDTs targeting a broad range of CMDx, and for us to play a significant role in helping reduce the human and monetary costs of CMDx that are currently unsustainable and increasing.
 Our Platform
 We believe that our platform, if successful in producing an FDA-authorized and marketed product, can support the discovery and development of additional PDTs that can be advanced in clinical development to treat CMDx using nCBT. The platform consists of three integrated components.
 Behavioral Therapy. The behavioral therapy components of the platform consist of lessons, skill- building modules, and a mechanism for goal setting. These components deliver nCBT to patients at a pace and sequence that is designed to maximize treatment outcomes on an individual basis. They target the ideas, beliefs, and expectations to help change the neural pathways of the brain, reducing or removing obstacles to making sustained behavioral changes. Our PDT for treating type 2 diabetes, BT-001, consists of 26 therapy lessons, intended to be completed at a rate of about one per week. Each therapy lesson takes 5 to 20 minutes to complete. Associated with each lesson are skill-building modules, enabling practical application of the therapy lesson content in daily life. There are 96 skill-building modules in BT-001, and patients engage in them on a self- directed basis.
 Treatment Plans. A daily treatment plan is the primary engagement interface for patients. It guides changes in diet and exercise consistent with daily and weekly goals, encourages adherence to prescribed medications, and enables self-monitoring of disease biometrics. Brief, daily self-reported measures of both behaviors and biometrics serve as inputs to our treatment algorithms.
 Personalization. We use AI pre-programmed into our algorithm to adjust goals and personalize treatment plans to each individual patient based on their engagement and inputs. Remotely monitored app-engagement data, self-reported measures, and patient specific health data serve as the primary inputs into our proprietary treatment algorithms. We also use gamification and various feedback mechanisms to reward progress, encourage ongoing use, and visualize the impact of behavior changes made on the primary measures of disease status.
 



Inception, Development and Validation of our Platform
 We began development of our platform in 2015, starting with a small number of features thought to be essential for supporting effective and sustained behavior changes based on clinical evidence. Through a cycle of iteration and usability testing, we advanced the platform to a minimal state of readiness, paired the software with board-certified, physician-supervised health coaches, and studied it in various patient populations with CMDx. Those early feasibility studies demonstrated clinical potential comparable to commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension. The data from those earlier studies were peer-reviewed and published in medical journals (see Products; BT-001 and BT-002), and informed further development of a software-only configuration. The first software-only product, BT-001, to emerge from this platform was tested in a pilot study among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, which demonstrated that use of BT-001 resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control. The data from the pilot study was presented at Endocrine 2020. BT-001 is now being tested in a randomized, controlled clinical trial and based on our primary endpoint data in the clinical trial, we expect to file a de novo classification request with the FDA upon completion of the trial.
 In order to establish a comprehensive framework for ongoing product development, we adhere to rigorous product development procedures and processes documented in a commercially scalable Quality Management System (“QMS”). We believe this allows us to employ an agile software development process that results in the highest levels of product innovation while helping ensure consistent product quality and patient safety.
 
The foundational elements of our QMS are Design Controls and Risk Management Procedures which:
 •Ensure our product development processes and documentation comply with regulatory requirements (FDA 21 CFR Part 820 and ISO 14971).
 •Establish a repeatable framework for how we design, validate and deploy product candidates and product features.
 •Define standard operating procedures, including a series of checks and balances and stakeholder signoffs to help ensure oversight of patient safety at each phase of development.
 
Platform Leverage
 Because CMDx share common root causes which our platform is designed to address, we believe we can create products to treat additional CMDx with relatively small changes to one of our existing PDTs. This will greatly reduce product development time and cost. We believe this also means that learnings and improvements on any PDT can be leverageable across the platform. Additionally, because so many CMDx have comorbidities with other CMDx (e.g., patients diagnosed with diabetes are often also diagnosed with heart disease), we can gather data on effectiveness across many diseases with a single study. Finally, we expect to apply to the FDA for authorization for our first product candidate through a de novo classification process. However, we expect to apply for and obtain subsequent products through the 510(k) process. The 510(k) process typically requires a shorter premarket review period but the results from such authorization request processes cannot be guaranteed.
 As a result of these efficiencies, we believe we have the potential to develop a portfolio of PDTs for some of the most prevalent diseases in the U.S. at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional therapeutics.
 
Market Opportunity
 In 2016, the direct medical costs due to CMDx potentially addressed by the company’s platform were approximately $490 billion. Approximately 30% of direct medical costs are associated with medications; in type 2 diabetes, the portion associated with medications is approximately 43%. According to the Milken Institute, total direct medical costs by indication in the United States in 2016 were approximately as follows:
 •Type 2 diabetes: $190 billion (or $237 billion in 2017 according to the ADA)
 •Dyslipidemia: $75 billion
 •Coronary heart disease: $72 billion
 •Hypertension: $66 billion
 •Stroke: $52 billion


•Congestive heart failure: $30 billion
 •End-stage renal disease: $5 billion
 
PRODUCT CANDIDATE DESCRIPTIONS
 
We currently have five PDT candidates in clinical stages of development:
 •BT-001, potentially pivotal study in type 2 diabetes; announced primary endpoint data in March 2022; de novo classification request expected to be filed with the FDA upon completion of the trial
 •BT-002, pilot study in hypertension
 •BT-003, pilot study in hyperlipidemia
 
Our Pipeline
 


We expect to rapidly develop and, if approved, commercialize multiple product candidates. Our clinical development and regulatory strategy prospectively offer a tempo of related, high-value product launches that, if approved, will be differentiated from a traditional molecular therapeutics company. Unlike traditional therapeutics that require discrete and sequential phase I, II, and III trials, followed by a lengthy regulatory review process, we expect that our PDTs will require a single potentially pivotal trial to generate the data required for submission to the FDA. We believe our potentially pivotal trials can be conducted at a fraction of the cost and time of a new drug trial, and what we believe to be, an expedited FDA review process.
Problem, Solution and Market Opportunity by Product Candidate

BT-001 — Diabetes
 Type 2 diabetes is a chronic health condition that results in high levels of blood sugar. It occurs when the body is unable to use insulin properly. Insulin allows blood sugar, which comes mainly from the food we eat, to enter cells to be used for energy. It is highly likely that patients with type 2 diabetes will also develop one or more other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and/or chronic kidney disease.
 Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It was estimated that 34 million adults in the U.S. had type 2 diabetes in 2018. 27 million adults are receiving medical care for type 2 diabetes, but only about 13 million of these patients have well controlled blood sugars. In addition, approximately 88 million U.S. adults have prediabetes, up to 70% of which are expected to develop type 2 diabetes during their lifetime.


The American Diabetes Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes recommend a) changing behaviors to lower blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol, b) regular monitoring of blood sugar, kidney, heart, blood vessels, eye and nerve function, and c) chronic use of antihyperglycemic medications. Widespread failure to change behavior and the inability of current medications to address root causes of type 2 diabetes has resulted in a massive, growing and unsustainable crisis in the treatment of this disease.
 
Solution
 Under the guidance of a physician, BT-001 is a PDT intended to help patients with type 2 diabetes improve glycemic control. The BT-001 software delivers behavioral therapy to patients via a mobile application that targets behaviors related to improving glycemic control and is intended to reduce A1c. The physician ensures the patient is an appropriate candidate for behavioral therapy, monitors the patient for treatment effects and adjusts concurrent medications as needed.
Market Opportunity
 According to the American Diabetes Association (“ADA”), patients diagnosed with diabetes have annual medical costs that are 2.3 times higher than patients without diabetes. The ADA estimated that patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes incurred average medical costs of $16,750 in 2017, of which about $9,600 was attributed directly to diabetes. Additionally, the ADA estimates total annual drug cost for treating diabetes in 2017 to be approximately $102 billion, which is a four-fold increase since 2007. This includes nearly $15 billion for insulin, $16 billion for other antihyperglycemic agents, and $71 billion for other prescription drugs that can be attributed to higher disease prevalence associated with diabetes.
Clinical Development
 Early feasibility study
 In 2017, we conducted a 12-week feasibility study in 118 patients with type 2 diabetes. The intervention was delivered by an early version of BT-001 paired with a health coach providing remote support to patients approximately every two weeks by phone. Study participants all had baseline A1c > 6.5% (mean = 8.1%), were mostly female (81%), resided in 38 U.S. states, and had a mean age of 51 years.
 After 12-weeks, mean change in A1c was -.8% (p<.001) (this result is considered to be statistically significant), and among those participants with baseline A1c >7.0%, mean change was -1.1% (p<.001) (this result is considered to be statistically significant). Greater glycemic control was observed in those that used BT-001 more often (p=.03) (this result is considered to be statistically significant). The average engagement rate was 4.3 times per day and retention was 86% in this broadly distributed sample.
 Data from the study were peer-reviewed and published in Journal of Medical Internet Research Diabetes in 2018.
 Key findings of the pilot study
 In early 2020, we completed a single-arm, uncontrolled, unblinded pilot study of BT-001, presented the data at Endocrine 2020, and published results in the Journal of the Endocrine Society. In our single-arm pilot study, the addition of the BT-001 treatment regimen to subjects who were, on average, already taking 2.2 oral diabetes medications and continued those medications during the study resulted in an average 1.0% estimated reduction in A1c of participants after 84 days. While the pilot study was not designed as a head-to-head comparison of BT-001 to oral medications, these data compare favorably to historical data published in the Journal of Diabetes Care in August 2010 which suggest an average 0.5% — 1.25% range of A1c reduction from untreated baseline with oral medications alone. The key finding was that the clinical outcomes measured were just as strong using a software-only product as for the earlier software-plus-coaching configuration. In the early feasibility study, the outcomes were attributed to the combination of the early BT-001 software and the remote human intervention delivered by health coaches and behavioral specialists. In contrast, the outcomes found in the pilot could be attributed directly to the use of BT-001 software.
 The pilot study involved 80 adults with type 2 diabetes residing in 32 U.S. states who used BT-001 for up to 12 weeks. Participants had a 3-day average fasting blood glucose value of 152 mg/dL or greater, corresponding to a baseline A1c of 7% or greater. On average, participants were 55.7 years old, had a body mass index in the obese range, were taking 2.2 antihyperglycemic medications and were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 10.4 years prior to the start of the study.


Use of BT-001 resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control. The mean decrease in fasting blood glucose (or FBG) of -22.9 mg/dL (p<.001) corresponds to approximately a 1.0% reduction in A1c. An A1c reduction of 1.0% has been associated with a 21% decrease in diabetes related mortality and a 40% reduction in microvascular complications in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, a multisite randomized intervention trial involving 5,102 patients with 20-years of follow up. We believe these results suggest use of BT-001 may be associated with meaningful improvements in glycemic control in a widely distributed treatment population, offers potential as a standalone treatment or when used alongside medications, and is currently conducting further study in its potentially pivotal trial.
 We observed a significant dose response (p=.04) (this result is considered to be statistically significant) between the degree of engagement in nCBT content and improvements in glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes. This is encouraging because it indicates that digitally delivered behavioral therapy using only software has the potential to treat disease at scale. Reductions in blood glucose were more significant and occurred faster than we had expected. BT-001 allows patients to make behavioral changes at a self-determined pace, which means that for some individuals it might take longer to see blood glucose reductions. In this context, blood sugar control was achieved more rapidly than expected, with 42% of participants achieving a fasting blood glucose less than 152 mg/dL (corresponding to an A1c < 7%, which is commonly regarded as the goal for A1c for most patients with type 2 diabetes) and 16% achieving a fasting blood glucose less than 130 mg/dL (corresponding, on average to an A1c < 6.5%, a much more aggressive goal for A1c) after an average of 65 days. Bi-weekly fasting blood sugars values for participants are displayed in the table below, which suggests a rapid and progressive improvement in blood glucose. We hypothesized that longer duration of use may result in even greater improvements and we plan to study this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial.
 


Changes in FBG Observed in a Pilot Study of BT-001
 


Improvements in blood glucose occurred in participants from across the country and with longstanding diabetes. No serious adverse events were observed in the study period. While it is commonly assumed that only newly diagnosed patients will benefit from behavioral therapy, based on the generally accepted view that the lowering of HbA1c of 0.4 is significant, we were encouraged to see a clinical activity from the usage of BT-001, which is yet to be authorized for marketing by the FDA, in patients who were on average diagnosed with diabetes more than 10 years ago. At baseline, these patients all had poorly controlled diabetes despite taking a mean of 2.2 antihyperglycemic medications. We had geographic diversity with participants from 32 states, including those with increasing prevalence of diabetes (e.g., Florida, Indiana and North Carolina).
 

Potentially Pivotal Trial of BT-001
 We screened the first patient into our potentially pivotal unblinded study of BT-001 in February 2021 and completed full enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2021, enrolling a total of 669 patients. The study includes individuals with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (baseline A1c 7% or above and below 11%) who will each participate for six months. Prior to the start of the study, we discussed core aspects of the design of the trial with the FDA during several formal meeting interactions. During these formal meeting interactions, we aligned with the FDA that an appropriate endpoint is a clinically meaningful change in A1c as determined by the mean change in A1c in the BT-001 group compared to the mean change in the control group. The primary endpoint was evaluated at 90 days, and it will also be evaluated as a secondary endpoint at 180 days. The study is powered to detect a 0.4% or greater change in A1c at 90 days, between BT-001 and control and a statistically significant change (p<0.05) in A1c at 180 days. The study assessed a safety endpoint (the occurrence, relatedness and severity of Adverse Events) at day 90 and will assess a safety endpoint again at day 180. We will use the data from this study to prepare a de novo classification submission to the FDA. We believe a single potentially pivotal trial of BT-001, if successful and its results viewed favorably by the FDA, will be sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing authorization of BT-001 for the treatment of diabetes. We announced primary endpoint data from our clinical trial of BT-001 in March 2022. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change from baseline in A1c after 90 days of treatment between the two groups and showed highly statistically significant improvement in A1c between the intervention and control groups (-0.4%, p <0.001). Clinically meaningful changes (A1c reductions of 0.4% or more) occurred in 42.7% of the group receiving standard of care and BT-001 versus 25.4% in the group receiving standard of care alone (difference of 17.3%, p <0.001). We believe this demonstrates that the use of BT-001 significantly improved A1c compared to standard of care alone. The six-month trial is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.
Patients interested in participating in the BT-001 potentially pivotal trial were included if they were between 18 and 75 years old, had a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater, had a stable A1c level and no recent changes in antihyperglycemic medications. Participants were excluded if they use tobacco or other addictive substances, or were taking medications that would interfere with study measures, such as chemotherapy or steroids. Participants with unstable or life-threatening medical illnesses, such as COVID-19, or who are active suicidality were also excluded. The aim of recruitment was to generate a nationally representative sample of adults with type 2 diabetes located in five geographically distinct regions.
 Those who passed the run-in period were randomized in a 1-to-1 manner to either a standard of care (“SOC”) group or a standard of care plus BT-001 group. Both groups had blood tests and biometrics collected at 90 days and will have them collected again at180 days, and will be followed closely for adverse events during the entire study period. In addition to A1c levels, participants provided laboratory measures of cholesterol, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular risk, along with blood pressure and weight at baseline, at day 90 and will do so again at day 180. Participants were also asked to complete standardized surveys to assess changes in depression, quality of life and patient satisfaction at day 90 and will be asked to complete them again at day 180.
 Given the compelling benefit-to-risk profile of BT-001 and highly statistically significant 0.4% reduction in A1c observed at day 90 of the clinical trial for BT-001, we intend to file a de novo classification request with the FDA upon completion of the trial. In addition, due to high rates of comorbidity with type 2 diabetes, we anticipate the potentially pivotal data read out from BT-001 will also give us significant pilot data on up to four additional indications including type 2 diabetes with hypertension, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. We have named our PDT’s targeting these conditions, BT-002 and BT-003, respectively. We expect to advance the most promising two of these to potentially pivotal trials in 2022 or early 2023.
 
BT-002 — Hypertension
 Hypertension is a chronic health condition that results in high blood pressure. It occurs when the body is unable to properly regulate the pressure of blood moving through blood vessels. With chronic hypertension, the body’s organs are put under constant stress and are more likely to break down. It is common for patients with longstanding hypertension to develop heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and/or dementia.
 Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases. In 2017, it was estimated that 108 million U.S. adults have hypertension. Of these patients who are already taking blood pressure lowering medications, approximately 35% still have uncontrolled blood pressure.


Guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend a) changing behaviors to lower blood pressure, b) regular monitoring of blood pressure, kidney, and heart function, c) chronic use of antihypertensive medications. Widespread failure to change behavior and the inability of current medications to address root causes of hypertension has resulted in a massive, growing and unsustainable crisis in the treatment of this disease.
 
Solution
 Under the guidance of a physician, BT-002 is a PDT under development to help patients with hypertension improve their blood pressure. The BT-002 software is designed to deliver behavioral therapy to patients via a mobile application that targets behaviors related to achieving blood pressure control and is intended to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Market Opportunity
 Patients with hypertension are estimated to have nearly triple the prescription drug costs as patients without hypertension. A 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association concludes the annual prescription drug cost was $2,400 for individuals with hypertension versus only $815 for those without hypertension. For all adults in the United States with hypertension, this represents an estimated annual incremental drug cost for patients with hypertension of $42 billion in 2016.
Clinical Development
 A detailed plan for the BT-002 potentially pivotal trial would be refined using blood pressure data obtained from the BT-001 potentially pivotal randomized, controlled trial. We estimate that about one third of participants in the BT-001 potentially pivotal trial will have comorbid hypertension that is poorly controlled at baseline. Since type 2 diabetes and hypertension share common root causes, we expect to see blood pressure improvements in these participants to a degree comparable to BT-002. Because the BT-001 potentially pivotal trial includes measurement of blood pressure along with A1c at every time point, we expect to have 90 and 180 day randomized, controlled data on blood pressure for approximately 200 participants. 90 day data was received in the first quarter of 2022 and we believe it may be sufficient pilot data to allow for planning the BT-002 potentially pivotal trial.
 It is anticipated that the BT-002 potentially pivotal trial would evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BT-002 in a nationally representative sample of approximately 500 U.S. adults with hypertension located in 5 geographically distinct regions. Adults, aged 18-75, would be included if their resting blood pressure is poorly controlled (i.e., over 140/90 mmHg). These participants would be randomized in a one-to-one fashion to a control or intervention group. The control group would be provided standard of care treatment. The intervention group would be provided standard of care along with BT-002. The primary outcome measure would be resting systolic blood pressure, measured at 90 days. The secondary outcome measure would be resting systolic blood pressure, measured at 180 days.
 
BT-003 — Hyperlipidemia
 Hyperlipidemia is a chronic health condition that results in high levels of blood cholesterol. It occurs when the body is unable to get rid of harmful types of cholesterol circulating in the blood. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the most common form of harmful cholesterol. A dietary pattern high in unhealthy fats, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrates along with insufficient exercise, are the most common causes of high blood cholesterol. Over time, the presence of too much harmful cholesterol leads to cholesterol build up in the body’s arteries, limiting blood flow. It is very common for patients with longstanding hyperlipidemia to develop one or more other medical conditions caused by cholesterol build-up such as heart disease, stroke, and/or peripheral artery disease.
 Hyperlipidemia is one of the most common chronic diseases. It was estimated that 65 million adults in the U.S. had hyperlipidemia in 2016. In 2016, it was estimated that 28 million adults had poorly controlled cholesterol levels.
 Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia recommend a) changing behaviors to lower harmful cholesterol and raise healthy cholesterol levels, b) regular monitoring of blood cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure, and c) chronic use of cholesterol-lowering medications. Widespread failure to change behavior and the inability of current medications to address root causes of hyperlipidemia has resulted in a massive, growing and unsustainable crisis in the treatment of this disease.

 Under the guidance of a physician, BT-003 is a PDT under development to help patients with hyperlipidemia improve cholesterol levels. The BT-003 software is designed to deliver behavioral therapy to patients via a mobile application that targets behaviors related to the control of cholesterol levels and is intended to reduce LDL cholesterol.
Market Opportunity
 According to American Heart Association, the annual incremental drug cost for patients with hyperlipidemia was estimated to be $12 billion in 2016. Also, due to updated clinical guidelines which make more aggressive treatment recommendations, an additional 12.3 million more Americans would be treated with cholesterol-lowering medications by 2025, increasing treatment costs by $13.3 billion per year.
Clinical Development
 A detailed plan for the BT-003 potentially pivotal trial would be refined using blood cholesterol data obtained from the BT-001 potentially pivotal randomized, controlled trial. We estimate that about one quarter of participants in the BT-001 potentially pivotal trial will have comorbid hyperlipidemia that is poorly controlled at baseline. Since type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia share common root causes, we expect to see cholesterol improvements in these participants to a degree comparable to BT-003. Because the BT-001 potentially pivotal trial includes measurement of fasting blood cholesterol along with A1c at every time point, we expect to have 90 and 180 day randomized, controlled data on cholesterol for approximately 140 participants. These data were received in the first quarter of 2022 and we believe it may be sufficient pilot data to allow for planning the BT-003 potentially pivotal trial.
 It is anticipated that the BT-003 potentially pivotal trial would evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BT-003 in a nationally representative sample of approximately 500 U.S. adults with hyperlipidemia located in 5 geographically distinct regions. Adults, aged 18-75, would be included if their fasting LDL cholesterol is poorly controlled (i.e., above their risk-adjusted target). These participants would be randomized in a one-to-one fashion to a control or intervention group. The control group would be provided standard of care treatment. The intervention group would be provided standard of care along with BT-003. The primary outcome measure would be fasting LDL cholesterol, measured at 90 days. The secondary outcome measure would be fasting LDL cholesterol, measured at 180 days.
 
Competitive Advantages
 To establish competitive advantage in our target markets, we are building on our early recognition of the potential of PDT’s in CMDx, our focus on treating root causes, and our ability to leverage our platform to accelerate regulatory clearances of subsequent product launches. We believe it has the following advantages over existing and/or potential competitors:
 •Regulatory Lead Time. To achieve marketing authorization as a PDT, the FDA requires safety and efficacy data from a randomized controlled clinical trial, an extensive submission package for review, and a wait time for that decision, during which time FDA may make inquiries or requests of the applicant. Given that we are unaware of any competitors focused on PDTs in CMDx, we believe this current absence in the pipelines of competitors affords us a lead time for our products, if approved.
 •First Mover Market Advantage. In combination with other increasing advantages, we believe the branding and marketing benefits of launching our products as the first of a novel class of nCBT digital therapeutics will enable us to achieve and maintain a meaningful share of CMDx markets held by PDT’s, despite potential launches by followers.
 •Intellectual Property. We have filed four patent families covering methods of treatment, methods of managing medications, and the systems and software that comprise our platform. The expiration of any U.S. or foreign patents issuing from the first two families is 2038. The expiration of any U.S. or foreign patents issuing from the third family is 2039.
 •Network Effects. Every patient we treat generates data that we can use to improve our algorithms. The rate at which our patient data are increasing and our ability to continuously improve our products based on these data will make it increasingly challenging, we believe, for followers to offer products comparable in quality to ours.


•The potential to reverse disease. At the time of diagnosis with type 2 diabetes the primary unknowns are the rates at which the patient is going to get sicker and require additional medications. We recognize a significant opportunity to intervene at two primary points in the progression of this disease: first diagnosis and just before the commencement of insulin. To halt its progression and for many patients reverse the disease altogether, we believe we can help reframe the dynamic of intervention around type 2 diabetes care away from the expectation of inevitable decline.
 •Rapid and low-cost development compared to traditional therapeutics. Unlike developing new traditional therapeutics, we believe we can generate the data needed to support regulatory authorization or clearance on the basis of a single pivotal randomized controlled trial. We expect many of these trials can be conducted in six months or less, and at a fraction of the cost of a drug trial. The regulatory review process, whether de novo or 510(k), takes only several months, on average.
 •Continuously improving therapeutics and more informed clinical decisions. With certain restrictions, we can use data generated through patient use of our PDTs to make continuous improvements in our existing and future products to incrementally increase efficacy and generalizability. We could also potentially use data to improve clinical decisions when it can be provided back to the prescribing physician, and future products could possibly help guide the appropriate de-prescription of medications in those patients that are successful in changing behaviors and improving their condition.
 
Our Strategy
 We aspire to change the way CMDx are treated to improve patient health and reduce healthcare spending. We believe our platform technology, first-to-market advantage, intellectual property portfolio, and groundbreaking research will facilitate the achievement of this goal. Our immediate focus is on:
 •Advancing our lead product candidate, BT-001, through our potentially pivotal trial and regulatory authorization. Approximately 27 million patients in the United States are receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes, of which approximately 13 million are uncontrolled (A1c 7% or above). In our single-arm pilot study, the addition of the BT-001 treatment regimen to subjects who were, on average, already taking 2.2 oral diabetes medications and continued those medications during the study resulted in an average 1.0% estimated reduction in A1c of participants after 84 days. While the pilot study was not designed as a head-to-head comparison of BT-001 to oral medications, these data compare favorably to historical data published in the Journal of Diabetes Care in August 2010 (Source 1. The Effect of Oral Anti-diabetic Agents on A1C Levels, Diabetes Care, Volume 33(8); 2010 Aug.) which suggest an average 0.5% - 1.25% range of A1c reduction from untreated baseline with oral medications alone. We are currently conducting a potentially pivotal unblinded trial of BT-001 in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. We announced primary endpoint data from our clinical trial of BT-001 in March 2022. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change from baseline in A1c after 90 days of treatment between the two groups and showed highly statistically significant improvement in A1c between the intervention and control groups (-0.4%, p <0.001). Clinically meaningful changes (A1c reductions of 0.4% or more) occurred in 42.7% of the group receiving standard of care and BT-001 versus 25.4% in the group receiving standard of care alone (difference of 17.3%, p <0.001). We believe this demonstrates that the use of BT-001 significantly improved A1c compared to standard of care alone. The six-month trial is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Given the compelling benefit-to-risk profile of BT-001 and highly statistically significant 0.4% reduction in A1c, Better Therapeutics intends to file a de novo classification request with the FDA upon completion of the study.
 •Securing broad reimbursement coverage for our PDTs. We believe a PDT that targets root causes to improve glycemic control by lowering A1c, addresses common comorbidities, and potentially reduces or eliminates the ongoing need for medications would offer significant value to payers by reducing costs of treating this patient population. During blinded interviews conducted by us with a group of eight key decision-makers across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid payers, all interviewees responded favorably to the BT-001 target product profile with a willingness to reimburse within the range of other branded T2D treatments and pay in our current forecasted pricing range, with a pricing range of $100-$250 being considered low risk of securing a favorable reimbursement coverage decision, $250-$600 being considered moderate risk of securing a favorable reimbursement coverage decision and price of over $600 being considered high risk of securing a favorable reimbursement coverage decision. Further, we intend to pursue coverage from commercial insurance providers and Medicare Part B, but do not intend to pursue coverage by Medicaid.


•Building a focused sales force to introduce our products to primary care providers. 4% of primary care providers treat approximately 20% of patients with type 2 diabetes. We believe these providers could be accessed with a 100-person sales force, which we expect to have recruited and deployed by the midpoint of the first year of commercialization. Furthermore, we expect that due to the unique, innovative nature of our products and the company’s first mover advantage in large CMDx markets, we will be able to attract dedicated and talented sales professionals. We expect to increase the size of our sales force as reimbursement coverage increases and to support follow on products.
 •Integrating our products into the standard of care. Clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes and other CMDx recommend that healthcare providers facilitate behavioral changes as the first line of therapy. However, they often do not have the ability to provide or prescribe effective behavioral therapy to their patients. This is the gap in treatment we seek to fill. Through publications, presentations and medical education, we will help providers understand the potential of BT-001 and future products to fully enact treatment guidelines. We conduct rigorous clinical and basic science research and will continue to publish the results of this research in peer-reviewed journals. To date, we have published five studies in peer-reviewed journals and our research has been highlighted at several conferences including the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, IPSOR 2019, and Endocrine 2020.
 •Using our platform capabilities to accelerate development across CMDx. We estimate that 20 or more CMDx indications share essentially the same root causes. Many CMDx have comorbidities with other CMDx, so we have the ability to gather efficacy data on multiple diseases with each clinical trial we conduct. This allows us to continually improve our platform for the benefit of all CMDx and accelerate the development and regulatory authorization or clearance of products targeting new indications.
 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and digital health industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, digital health companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cardiometabolic therapies. Any products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop therapeutics as treatments for CMDx. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing such treatments for CMDx including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Merck, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Novartis.
 The competitive landscape shown below illustrates our competitors in the market space commonly described as “diabetes tech”, the digital health space focused on addressing problems associated with type 2 diabetes. We believe the competitive landscape is best understood by comparing the primary mechanism of action (behavioral support/intervention or improving medication adherence and tracking); to the business model for patient acquisition (apps marketed direct-to-consumer; tech-enabled healthcare services offered to members of health plans, most often those of self-insured employers; or regulated products prescribed by providers).
 



While some solutions have evolved to include elements of various mechanisms such as behavioral support, reminders for medication adherence, or remote monitoring and transmission of biometric data, in our view, each has a primary mechanism for affecting disease and a clearly defined model for acquiring patients or consumers.
 To our knowledge, upon completion of our potentially pivotal trial, if successful, and regulatory authorization, BT-001 will be the only regulated PDT with a direct treatment claim for type 2 diabetes that can be prescribed by providers and reimbursed by insurance as a pharmacy benefit, much like a drug. Exploiting this opportunity requires us to generate significant evidence of safety, efficacy and impact on the total cost of care. While many early market entrants (in fact, nearly 360,000 health and wellness apps are now available in Apple’s App Store) are making marketing claims related to the ability to improve type 2 diabetes care and are acquiring patients through their employers or direct-to-consumer advertising, we believe the landscape will change dramatically when new solutions that can be prescribed by providers and covered by insurance become broadly available.
 There are a number of companies in the prescription digital therapeutics space but none of these companies have commercialized a prescription digital therapeutic to target a cardiometabolic disease at this time.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and digital health industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory authorization for their products more rapidly than we may obtain authorization for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our products, if authorized for marketing, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and commercial payers.
 

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our digital therapeutic platform, novel treatment algorithms and uses thereof, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our digital therapeutic platform, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering the machine learning aspects and key features of our products, along with the methods of use in treating a wide variety of cardiometabolic disorders and assisting patients and their caregivers in the management of disease. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use as well as subsequent iterations and improvements to our products and use of predictive analytics.
 As of December 31, 2021, there are four patent families with national stage applications pending in the U.S., Europe and Canada, for a total of eight pending U.S. and foreign applications, with claims directed to systems encompassing our digital therapeutic platform, and related methods of use in treating cardiometabolic disorders. The statutory expiration for any U.S. and foreign patents issuing from these two patent families will be 2038. There is also a third patent family with national stage applications pending in the U.S., Europe and Canada, with claims directed to methods for predicting health outcomes and managing chronic medications. The statutory expiration for any U.S. and foreign patents issuing in this patent family will be 2039. In addition, there is a fourth patent family represented by a pending U.S. provisional application with claims directed to various implementations of nutritional cognitive behavioral therapy in our digital therapeutic platform. The statutory expiration for any U.S. and foreign patents issuing in this patent family will be 2041.
    Government Regulation
    Insurance and Coverage
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payers is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our products, if authorized for marketing, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which treatments they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new treatments are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new treatment will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payers is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of products that we may develop will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers.
  There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the device is authorized by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
  Payers consider the following factors in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan,
 •safe, effective and medically necessary,
 •appropriate for the specific patient,
 •cost-effective, and


•neither experimental nor investigational.
 Each payer determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a treatment, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the treatment and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payer’s list of covered drugs, biological products, and medical devices, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly authorized products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is authorized by the FDA.
  In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a prescription device must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing device pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Health Care Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry (e.g., healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers), are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. We also may be subject to patient information and privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
    •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA or federal civil money penalties,


•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the FCA, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement of record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A person can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery,
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation,
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts,
 •The U.S. federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“ACA”), including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners,
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs,
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers,


•Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payers, including private insurers. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require medical device manufacturers to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective May 2018, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge and may not comply under one or more of such laws, regulations, and guidance. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
    Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including protected health information. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change. In addition, in the future, industry requirements or guidance, contractual obligations, and/or legislation at both the federal and the state level may limit, forbid or regulate the use or transmission of health information outside of the United States.
 Federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or personally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.
 There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identification, anonymization or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed and amended laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and has been amended several times. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). Additionally, a new Virginia privacy law, the Comprehensive Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), was signed into law on March 2, 2021 and is also scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA will impose many similar obligations regarding the processing and storing of personal information as the CCPA and the CPRA. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation, and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. While the CCPA, CPRA, and VCDPA contain exceptions for certain activities involving Protected Health Information (“PHI”) already regulated under HIPAA, we cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA, VCDPA or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.
 

Health Care Legislative Reform
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April, 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022 and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. 
 •On January 2, 2013 the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. 
 •On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. 


There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to product pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of therapies under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. It is unclear what effect such legislative and enforcement interest may have on prescription devices.
We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we received for any approved device, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels in the U.S. directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop products. If we, or any third parties we may engage, are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our current or any future product candidates we may develop may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.
    FDA Regulation
    United States
 We are developing medical devices that are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance, de novo classification or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Premarket Clearance, De Novo Grant and Approval Requirements
 Each digital therapeutic we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior de novo classification grant, 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or an approved premarket approval application (“PMA”) from the FDA under its medical device authorities. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; or if there is no legally marketed predicate device and general controls alone or with special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will allow the new device to be marketed under a de novo classification grant; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a premarket notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. A premarket notification, de novo classification request and PMA must be accompanied by a user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 When a 510(k) clearance is required, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a 510(k) premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before the manufacturer intends to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the 510(k) premarket notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III.
 There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special; and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification(s) needs a new 510(k) and the method(s) used to evaluate the change(s) are well-established, and the results can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
 

De Novo Classification
 When it is determined that there is no legally marketed predicate device, the de novo process provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use. Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (“FDAMA”), established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”), a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks classification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the request for de novo classification if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. Devices that are classified into Class I or Class II through a de novo classification request may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification 510(k) submissions.
Premarket Approval Pathway
 A PMA must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.
 After a PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision-making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
 FDA allows applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis. FDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or “modules” submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.
 Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
      
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support premarket approval, are often required for a de novo classification grant, and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), to the FDA prior to initiating clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, ("IRBs"), at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval, de novo classification or clearance of the product.
 Sponsors of certain clinical trials of devices are required to register with www.clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.
    Ongoing Regulation by the FDA
Even after a device receives clearance, de novo classification or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
    •establishment registration and device listing;
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
 •labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
 •corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and
 •post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a de novo classification grant, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require a manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, manufacturers may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.


Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs.
 FDA regulations require manufacturers to register with the FDA and to list the devices they market. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”), requires manufacturers to register within the state. Following these registrations, the FDA and the CDHS inspect manufacturers on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR and applicable state regulations. These regulations require that companies manufacture their products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
    •warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 •customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of products;
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
 •withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and
 •criminal prosecution.
 The FDA prohibits marketed devices from being marketed for off-label uses and regulates the advertising of certain devices as well. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution, including FCA liability for products covered under the federal health care programs.
 New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance, de novo classification or approval of our products under development.
 Based on published guidance and four interactions with the FDA, the regulatory pathway for BT-001 will be via a de novo classification request submission. Following the completion of our potentially pivotal study, we intend to prepare and submit to the FDA a de novo application and request for marketing authorization.

Reimbursement Coverage
 Despite widespread coverage of medications and digital disease management programs, commercial insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid (collectively “payers”) in the U.S. continue to be challenged with achieving cost effective care for their type 2 diabetes patient populations. It is estimated that type 2 diabetes adds an incremental $10,000 per patient per year or more in direct medical costs of which prescription drugs make up $4,500 per patient per year. Despite these high per patient costs and the considerable resources payers invest in the management of the disease, approximately half of type 2 diabetes patients are not able to achieve glycemic control.
 We recently conducted research among eight of the 10 largest payers in the U.S. to gain insight into the willingness to provide reimbursement coverage for BT-001 in type 2 diabetes. Key findings include:
 •type 2 diabetes remains a high-cost area for payers despite widespread coverage of medications and disease management programs;
 •payers are receptive to new solutions, including PDTs, to address the significant unmet medical needs in uncontrolled and comorbid patient populations;


•PDTs would be evaluated using a rigorous drug-like review process and would be expected to demonstrate a compelling combination of clinical and health economic impacts;
 •PDTs may be covered as pharmacy or medical benefits, though a majority of payers favor covering them as pharmacy benefits;
 •a target product profile (“TPP”) was tested using pilot results for BT-001 and payers indicated a willingness to cover at prices comparable to branded, oral glycemic control medications; and
 •based on the TPP, payers are enthusiastic about BT-001’s potential to reduce A1c and associated comorbidities, while reducing the total cost of care.
 
Our Payer Research
 


To optimize payer reimbursement coverage at and immediately following launch, we are generating evidence to substantiate the value of BT-001 based on its impact on clinical outcomes, total cost of care and durability of effect. Evidence will be generated from our six-month randomized controlled potentially pivotal trial, and a concurrent one-year real world use study with at least one major U.S. health system. We are conducting such real world evidence study in partnerships with Catalyst Health Network, a clinically integrated network of more than 1,000 health care providers, and Colorado Prevention Center Clinical Research, an affiliate of the University of Colorado Health System.
 We also plan to supplement this evidence with an assessment of the total cost of care in our intended patient population using multi-payer claims datasets. To estimate BT-001’s effect on total cost of care, we plan to leverage the totality of evidence related to BT-001 use to create robust cost-effectiveness and budget impact models. We expect to publish these results with reputable organizations like the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and utilize this evidence in the development of our Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy value dossier for submission to formulary review committees. Upon evidence availability, which we anticipate in the first half of 2022, we intend to engage payers to begin reimbursement coverage discussions.


Subject to review of final pivotal trial and real-world data, we intend to set pricing for BT-001 at a moderate discount to branded, oral glycemic control medications in order to gain maximum reimbursement coverage. Based on data from our pilot study of BT-001 and an early health economic model we published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) following peer-review, we estimate BT-001 has the potential to demonstrate dominant cost effectiveness and result in net healthcare cost savings of more than $4,500 per patient over a three-year period, primarily through decreased use of medications.
 We believe we may be successful in obtaining broad reimbursement coverage for BT-001 because: 1) it addresses an enormous problem — commercial payers and Medicare spend approximately $200 billion each year on type 2 diabetes; 2) these two payer types insure 86% of diabetes patients; 3) it will save payers money; and 4) it fills a gap in existing clinical guidelines and integrates with existing provider workflows.
 
Sales and Marketing
 The intended use at launch for BT-001 would be to improve glycemic control in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, under the supervision of their physician. This represents a target patient population of about 13 million in the U.S. and $40 billion a year spent on prescription drugs. It is estimated that 86% of type 2 diabetes patients receive regular care from their primary care provider to treat their condition. Within primary care, treatment of type 2 diabetes is concentrated. Based on a review of metformin prescribing data, we estimate 4% (about 17,000) of primary care providers treat about 20% of type 2 diabetes patients (approximately 5 million), suggesting that a relatively small number of primary care providers treat a disproportionate number of diabetes patients.
Concentration of Diabetes Patients Among Providers
 


In recent years, the delivery of primary care services has migrated from solo and small practice settings to larger group practices. Today, an estimated 70% of primary care providers are practicing in large group practice settings. The combination of patients being treated disproportionately by a relatively small number of providers and large-group practice settings creates an opportunity for a focused sales force to engage providers in a cost and time efficient manner to drive awareness and adoption of BT-001 and follow-on products.
 We intend to build a primary care sales force of approximately 100, at an annual cost of $30 million during the first-year commercial launch (2023), and scale that organization as widespread reimbursement coverage is achieved and follow-on products are launched.
 
Go-to-market strategy
 As a first mover with a novel class of therapeutic for type 2 diabetes, we have a unique opportunity to raise awareness to PDTs in treating CMDx. Combining advanced targeting analytics with digital marketing, we intend to build awareness among patients and providers of the unique role PDTs can play to improve outcomes by addressing the maladaptive behaviors at the root of type 2 diabetes. We intend to leverage evidence generated from our ongoing potentially pivotal trial and real-world use studies to publish clinical and health outcomes data to showcase BT-001’s benefits. We intend to present these results to key opinion leaders at upcoming congresses and society meetings in 2022. With the evidence generated, we also expect to begin the process of advocating for the incorporation of BT-001 into future consensus guidelines to further integrate its use as a first line PDT for treating type 2 diabetes.


At launch, we plan to transition from general awareness-building to branded promotional activities to generate demand for BT-001. These efforts will utilize the full spectrum of our marketing capabilities, including peer-to-peer education and active participation in professional society meetings. We also plan to continue our investment in targeting analytics, as well as digital and non-personal promotion; these will extend the reach of our sales force and help them efficiently and effectively educate primary care providers on BT-001. As payer reimbursement coverage increases, we expect to implement targeted, direct to consumer advertising to further educate patients on the benefits of BT-001 in type 2 diabetes.
 Alongside these efforts, we intend to build a medical affairs organization whose primary responsibilities will include engaging thought leaders in scientific discourse, establishing an advisory board of key opinion leaders, creating a primary care-based speaker’s panel and building advocates to support inclusion of BT-001 as part of future type 2 diabetes consensus guidelines. Our medical affairs team will also play a critical, ongoing role in generating and publishing evidence that demonstrates the impact BT-001 and future platform products can have on clinical outcomes, durability of effect and total cost of care.
 
Integration with the Standard of Care
 Type 2 diabetes is a devastating disease that progressively worsens over time and often leads to the development of complex comorbidities, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Lacking the tools to address the maladaptive behaviors that cause disease progression, providers utilize the only treatment options currently available — medications. As a patient’s diabetes worsens, providers typically add multiple medications in an attempt to achieve glycemic control for their patients. By age 65, type 2 diabetes patients are taking an average of five medications for treating diabetes and common comorbidities, while many are failing to achieve glycemic control.
 Clinical treatment guidelines from the ADA recommend use of behavioral therapy as a first line treatment on a standalone basis or alongside medications. Despite widespread alignment with these consensus guidelines, there are currently no FDA-regulated treatments available to address this unmet need or practical way for the healthcare system to deliver them. BT-001 represents a unique opportunity for providers to prescribe to their patients FDA-regulated behavioral therapy. Because BT-001 is specifically intended to address the behaviors that are the root causes of their condition, our first-to-market PDT treatment of type 2 diabetes holds out the hope for many of these patients to achieve better glycemic control, reduce or eliminate the need for medications, and avoid insulin therapy altogether.
 We believe there are two primary points in the patient journey where prescribing BT-001 would have the greatest clinical impact: 1) upon first diagnosis; and 2) during the immediate period preceding the commencement of insulin, when patient motivation to seek alternative solutions and avoid lifelong insulin injections is greatest.
 These two primary points for initiating BT-001 treatment fit easily within existing provider workflows to enable adoption at scale. If approved, BT-001 will be prescription-based and follow the same standard of care for the management of type 2 diabetes. Despite BT-001 being a new product form, we expect it will not negatively impact provider workload.
 
Partnering
 We will progressively increase business development efforts to maximize the value of BT-001 and our platform in non-dilutive ways. We will explore opportunities to partner with pharmaceutical companies marketing traditional drug therapies for CMDx that may benefit from an increase in efficacy and durability when combined with our prescription digital therapeutic. Opportunities may also exist to co-develop novel combination products with a pharmaceutical company operating in the cardiometabolic space.
 We intend to commercialize our products in the United States. We will also pursue opportunities to partner with pharmaceutical companies to commercialize our products outside of the United States.
 

Corporate History

Business Combination
 Our predecessor, Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. II (“MCAD”), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 31, 2020. On October 28, 2021, we completed our business combination (the “Business Combination”) whereby MCAD acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the former Better Therapeutics, Inc. (“Legacy BTX”) in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated April 6, 2021, as amended, by and among MCAD, MCAD Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and Legacy BTX.
Legacy BTX was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on April 1, 2015 under the name Nutrition Development Group LLC (the “LLC”). The LLC’s name was changed to Farewell LLC on August 18, 2016 and to Better Therapeutics LLC on January 4, 2018. The LLC merged into Legacy BTX, its wholly owned subsidiary, on August 14, 2020 with Legacy BTX surviving the merger.
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy BTX with Legacy BTX surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCAD with the new name Better Therapeutics OpCo, Inc. We raised $59 million in funding upon the completion of the Business Combination. In connection with the Business Combination, MCAD was renamed “Better Therapeutics, Inc.”
 
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 44 employees, all of which were full-time employees, including eight in general operations, three in commercial, nine in clinical care and operations, eleven in engineering, ten in product and design, and one in quality and regulatory. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
 We believe that our future success depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing development.
 Our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
 
Legal Proceedings
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible for and intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on- frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.


We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering (“IPO”), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we may adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-public companies instead of the dates required for other public companies.
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.

The other information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.
