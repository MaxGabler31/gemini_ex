 ﻿
 General
     This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning PriceSmart, Inc.'s (“PriceSmart,” "we," “us,” or the “Company”) anticipated future revenues and earnings, adequacy of future cash flow, projected warehouse club openings, the Company's performance relative to competitors and related matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements containing the words “expect,” “believe,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipated,” “scheduled” and like expressions, and the negative thereof. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements, including foreign exchange risks, political or economic instability of host countries, and competition, as well as those risks described in the Company's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including the risk factors referenced in this Form 10-K. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
 ﻿
 Our Company
 ﻿
 PriceSmart owns and operates U.S. style membership shopping warehouse clubs in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. These regions have a population of approximately 100 million people and a combined gross domestic product of just under $1.0 trillion. We also function as a wholesale supplier to a retailer in the Philippines.  We sell high quality brand name and private label consumer products at low prices to individuals and businesses.  Currently, our typical no-frills warehouse buildings range in sales floor size from 50,000 to 60,000 square feet and are located primarily in and around the major cities in our markets to take advantage of dense populations and relatively higher levels of disposable income. We have recently begun to construct smaller sales floor warehouse clubs.  We believe the smaller format can expand our reach into additional geographic areas and provides more convenience for our members. 
 ﻿
 During fiscal year 2018, we acquired Aeropost, Inc. (“Aeropost”).  Located in Miami, Aeropost is a cross border freight forwarding business that also operates an online marketplace.  Aeropost provides logistics, payment, and e-commerce services in Latin America and the Caribbean and currently serves customers in 38 countries with Costa Rica, Trinidad and Jamaica as its largest markets. Aeropost leases and operates small retail stores that enable customers to pick up and pay for merchandise. Aeropost has distribution and administration facilities in Miami, Florida. We are leveraging Aeropost’s technology, its management’s experience in developing software and systems for e-commerce and logistics, and its distribution and logistics systems to advance PriceSmart’s development of an omni-channel shopping experience for our members.
 ﻿
 As warehouse club operators, we believe that our business success depends on our ability to be the lowest cost operators in our markets and, in turn, to offer the lowest prices in our markets.  Lower prices drives sales volume, which increases the Company’s buying leverage, which in turn leads to better pricing that we can then offer to our members, validating the membership investment that our customers are making.  In fiscal year 2018, our average net merchandise sales were approximately $1,500 per square foot of sales floor space.
 ﻿
 We believe that paying our employees well and providing good benefits is not only the right thing to do, but also fosters a more motivated and loyal workforce resulting in less turnover and costs associated with loss of talent.
 ﻿
 Our warehouse clubs operate in developing markets that historically have had higher growth rates and lower warehouse club market penetration than the U.S. market. In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers, specialty stores, traditional wholesale distribution and growing online sales.

(1) | Small format warehouse club.
----+-----------------------------

  ﻿
 We opened a new warehouse club in Santa Ana, Costa Rica in October 2017 (fiscal year 2018), bringing the total number of PriceSmart warehouse clubs operating in Costa Rica to seven. In May 2018, we opened a new warehouse club in the Dominican Republic. This brought the number of PriceSmart warehouse clubs operating in the Dominican Republic to four.
 ﻿
 In May 2018, the Company acquired land in Panama and the Dominican Republic upon which the Company plans to construct new warehouse clubs. In Panama, the site is in the city of Santiago, which is a smaller city three hours west of Panama City by car and, upon completion, will be the sixth warehouse club in Panama. In the Dominican Republic, the site is in the city of Santo Domingo, a major metropolitan area, and upon completion, will be the fifth warehouse club in the Dominican Republic.  Both warehouse clubs are currently expected to open in the spring of 2019. Both of these warehouse clubs have been designed using our new small warehouse club format with sales floor square footage between 30,000 to 40,000 square feet, compared to 50,000 to 60,000 sales floor square footage within our most recent standard format warehouse club openings. These smaller format warehouse clubs represent our first developments of these format stores that are intended to reach into additional geographic areas and provide more convenience for our members. 
 ﻿
 In September 2018 (fiscal year 2019), the Company acquired land in San Cristobal, Guatemala, upon which the Company plans to construct a standard format warehouse club. San Cristobal is expected to open in the fall of 2019 (fiscal year 2020). We continue to explore other potential sites for future warehouse clubs, which could open as soon as fiscal year 2020, in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.
 ﻿
 Our warehouse clubs and local distribution centers are located in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and regional distribution centers are located primarily in the United States.  Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.
 ﻿
 We also operate a cross-border logistics and e-commerce business through our Aeropost, Inc. subsidiary which we acquired in March 2018. Aeropost operates in 38 countries directly or via agency relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean and has distribution and administration facilities in Miami, Florida.  
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 Low Operating Costs. Our format is designed to move merchandise from our suppliers to our members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution, minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also have opened distribution centers in certain of our high volume markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rates on high volume products. Our focus on driving down operating costs allows us to offer lower prices to our members, which we believe helps generate member loyalty, which in turn leads to increased sales.

    ﻿
 Worldwide Sourcing.  Approximately 51.0% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and Europe.  One of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our competitors is our United States-based buying team that sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world.  Our U.S.-based buyers identify and purchase new and exciting products, including our own Member’s Selection private label products.  Many of these products are available only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate.
 ﻿
 Membership. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry beginning over 42 years ago at Price Club, the first warehouse club. Membership fees are an additional component of enabling us to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retail and wholesalers and represent approximately 1.7% of net merchandise sales.  In addition, membership serves to promote customer loyalty.
 ﻿
 Our membership represents a desirable demographic concentration with strong purchasing power in our markets.  Most recently we have begun to expand our Platinum Membership program, which offers enhanced membership rewards and access to services such as discounts offered via our PriceSmart Travel website, future enhancement of our co-branded credit cards benefits, and expanding our service and product offering as exemplified by our new optical departments and our white goods direct delivery programs. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to further enhance the value of our membership in various areas.  We continue to explore opportunities to provide our members with products and services that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base. 
 ﻿
 Business Members. Our product selection, marketing and general business focus are directed to both business and retail consumers. Our business members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions including schools, and other businesses that purchase products for resale or use in their businesses. These business members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.
 ﻿
 Innovation. The warehouse club industry has been operating for over forty years, following the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has changed greatly over this period, particularly related to technology, the worldwide sourcing of products, a growing middle class in developing countries and ever changing consumer preferences. We have developed know-how to operate effectively in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, each with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, unique distribution and logistical challenges and member preferences that require our unique ability to source the correct mix of local versus imported merchandise. We believe that fundamental to our future success is our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future members. While not yet as prevalent as in the U.S., online sales penetration is clearly increasing in the markets where we operate. This past year we established an Innovation Committee, a standing committee reporting to our Board of Directors.  The Innovation Committee is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that Aeropost is successfully integrated into PriceSmart for the benefit of PriceSmart members. The Innovation Committee is also responsible for ensuring that our company has the right talent and expertise to provide our company the appropriate technology resources to effectively operate our business now and for the future.    ﻿
 Experienced Management Team. Our management team has extensive career experience in the warehouse club business.  Most of our executive team learned the warehouse club business at Price Club or Sam’s Club (a division of Walmart).  The Aeropost executive team has deep experience in developing online technology and marketing for e-commerce and logistics in the Latin America marketplace.
 ﻿
 Growth Strategy
 ﻿
 Our Board of Directors has approved a growth strategy that includes the following elements:
 ﻿
 Increasing same “store” sales.  We are committed to increasing same store sales by increasing the number of member transactions and by increasing the average order size.  There are a number of ways to increase same store sales.  In some of our highest volume locations, we have enlarged our buildings to expand sales floors and add more parking, including projects in our Pradera, Guatemala, San Salvador, El Salvador, Barranquilla, Colombia and Kingston, Jamaica locations.  We are planning to invest in a number of our locations in 2019 to improve the shopping experience for our members, including the development and implementation of new technology to expedite membership sign-up and renewal that we believe will drive same store sales growth.  Another way to increase same store sales is to operate more efficiently and improve the tracking and flow of merchandise to our locations in order to reduce out of stocks.  We believe that the use of technologies to identify member shopping patterns will help us to design targeted marketing campaigns, which will further drive sales. Additionally, we believe that continuing to enhance the member value proposition by offering new services, such as optical and discounts on external services like travel and insurance, helps drive member loyalty and overall sales.  Finally, we believe that online sales will increase same store sales, both by enabling our members to purchase online and having products delivered, as well as relocating certain products, such as bulky big ticket items, from the clubs to our distribution centers. We expect to test online sales opportunities in a few markets in late fiscal year 2019.

    ﻿
 Adding New Warehouse Clubs in Existing Markets. We currently operate in 13 countries/territories, with the largest in terms of population and gross domestic product being Colombia. In our non-Colombia markets, we plan to add additional warehouse clubs in our existing standard warehouse club format and in our new small warehouse club format where we believe the markets can support additional clubs. We also plan to continue to add warehouse clubs in Colombia which, due to the size of the market, we believe can potentially provide significant expansion opportunities.
 ﻿
 New Markets. This past year our management team has visited a number of potential new markets in order to evaluate the feasibility for expansion in conjunction with our online sales growth. Our management team is currently reviewing these market studies.  We anticipate that the market visits and market studies will lead to a decision to enter one or more new markets. 
 ﻿
 On-line Shopping and Other Services.  We have identified the following online strategic opportunities we intend to pursue through the application of Aeropost’s technology and management know how:
 ﻿
 1. Cross-border shopping:   Using the sourcing expertise and buying power of PriceSmart, we plan to extend the range of products that our members can purchase.  For now, these new products will be sourced in the U.S., fulfilled through the Aeropost distribution center in Miami and shipped to our members.  Members will be able to receive orders at their homes or businesses, at designated pick-up areas within PriceSmart locations or at Aeropost locations in PriceSmart countries.
 ﻿
 2. Online orders of club merchandise:  We plan to transfer certain large ticket products from our clubs to our distribution center, initially in a few markets, so that members can order these products online and have them shipped directly to their home or business or picked up at a PriceSmart location.  We are also exploring the opportunity to add products to our in-country selection and fulfilling online orders directly from the distribution center.
 ﻿
 3. Small club format:  Increasing capabilities enabled by technology is essential to the success of our urban and smaller city small club format.  These smaller clubs will have reduced selection of non-food products, but we plan to enable members to order online any product typically available at our larger format clubs.
 ﻿
 4. Home delivery:  Consumers increasingly are requesting home delivery or store pick up for larger items as well as for their everyday basic shopping needs, such as consumable merchandise.  We are developing solutions, through technology and partnerships, to enable our members to order online and have products delivered to their homes or made available for pick up at a PriceSmart location.
 ﻿
 5. Additional expansion opportunities: We are currently exploring the possibilities of combining PriceSmart’s purchasing power with Aeropost’s wider geographic presence and online capabilities to sell merchandise in markets where PriceSmart does not currently have a presence. 
 ﻿
 Distribution Efficiency.  Since our inception, we have consistently believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our traditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online.  Because PriceSmart sources merchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries where infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as modern as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more significant for us.  Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our members is key to the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we price our products.
 ﻿
 Historically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have shipped to Miami where their products are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our locations.  Regional and in-country suppliers have also shipped directly to our locations.  As our location sales volumes have grown, this system no longer provides all the answers we need.  We now understand that we need to route more of our products from both international, regional and local suppliers to major regional distribution centers in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply and reduce expense inefficiencies, all with the goal of giving better prices to our members.
 ﻿
 We recently opened our first regional distribution center, which is located in Costa Rica within the metropolitan area of San Jose. This 165,000 square foot building is designed to receive, store and ship dry, refrigerated and frozen products to our clubs in Central America with the exception of Panama. This regional distribution center will also have the capacity to ship products such as major appliances and eventually online products directly to our members or to convenient pick-up locations, including our clubs.  Assuming we are able to validate the benefits of this regional distribution center, we will consider other strategic locations for similar distribution centers.
 ﻿

    Specifically related to produce, we have recently opened our own produce distribution facility in Panama and also plan to distribute produce from our new regional distribution facility in Costa Rica.  Historically, we have purchased produce products from wholesalers.  We believe buying direct from growers and handling the distribution will allow us to better control quality and drive lower prices for our members. Depending on the success of our facility in Panama, we plan to consider establishing produce distribution facilities in other markets where sufficient locally grown produce is available.
 ﻿
 Our Membership Policy
 ﻿
 We offer three types of memberships: Business, Diamond and Platinum. Businesses qualify for Business membership. We promote Business membership through our marketing programs and by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. Business members pay an annual membership fee of approximately $30 for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 for additional add-on membership cards. 
 ﻿
 The Diamond membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond membership in most markets is approximately $35 (entitling members to two cards). We increased the fee in June 2012 from approximately $30. In Colombia, the Diamond membership fee has been 75,000 (COP) (including VAT) since February 2017, providing a converted membership price of approximately $25.  
 ﻿
 The Company began offering Platinum memberships in Costa Rica during fiscal year 2013 and expanded this offering into Panama, Dominican Republic and Trinidad during fiscal year 2018. The annual fee for a Platinum membership in most markets is approximately $75. The Platinum membership provides members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500.  Platinum members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period.  The Company records this 2% rebate as a reduction of revenue at the time of the sales transaction.  Accordingly, the Company has reduced warehouse sales and has accrued a liability within other accrued expenses.  The rebate is issued annually to Platinum members on March 1 and expires August 31.  Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue.  During October 2018 (fiscal year 2019) we began offering Platinum memberships in the United States Virgin Islands.  Over the next two years, we expect to continue expanding Platinum membership to all our other PriceSmart markets. 
 ﻿
 We recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership.  Deferred membership income is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $22.9 million and $22.1 million as of August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively.  Our membership agreements provide that our members may cancel their membership and may receive a refund of the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.  
 ﻿
 Our Intellectual Property Rights
 ﻿
 It is our policy to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and other similar measures. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While management believes that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know-how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation.
 ﻿
 Our Competition
 ﻿
 Our international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours and the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources, buying power and name recognition.  In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators.  However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito and Cencosud in Colombia.  We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format.  We have noted that certain retailers are making investments in upgrading their locations within our markets.  These actions may result in increased competition within our markets.  Further, it is possible that additional U.S. warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. We also face competition from online retailers and last-mile delivery services that serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.

    Our Employees
 ﻿
 As of August 31, 2018, we had a total of 8,680 employees. Approximately 93% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and unions represent approximately 1,568 employees. Our policy is to provide employees with good wages relative to the competition in the markets in which they work and to provide good benefits which often exceed the legal requirements for countries in which we do business.  We believe that investing in our employees, treating them as partners in our business and providing opportunities for career advancement lead to long-serving, loyal employees, which in turn creates efficiencies in operations and results in better service to our members. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
 ﻿
 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
 ﻿
 Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets.  In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable.  Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter.  In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.
