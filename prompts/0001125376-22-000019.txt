Item 1.        BUSINESS
Founded in 1999, The Ensign Group, Inc. ("Ensign") is a holding company with subsidiaries that provide skilled nursing, senior living and rehabilitative services, as well as other ancillary businesses (including mobile diagnostics and medical transportation), in 13 states. As part of our investment strategy, we also acquire, lease and own healthcare real estate to service the post-acute care continuum through acquisition and investment opportunities in healthcare properties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately 96.0% of our revenue from our skilled nursing facilities. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from our real estate properties, senior living services and other ancillary services.
OPERATIONS
Overview
As of December 31, 2021, we offered skilled nursing, senior living and rehabilitative care services through 245 skilled nursing and senior living facilities. Of the 245 facilities, we operated 176 facilities under long-term lease arrangements, and have options to purchase 11 of those 176 facilities. Our real estate portfolio includes 100 owned real estate properties, which includes 69 operations we operated and managed, the real estate associated with 32 senior living operations that were leased to and operated by The Pennant Group, Inc. (Pennant) as part of the Spin-Off (defined below), and the Service Center location. Of the 32 real estate operations leased to Pennant, two senior living operations are located on the same real estate properties as skilled nursing facilities that the Company owns and operates.
Our Unique Approach and Structure
The name "Ensign" is synonymous with a "flag" or a "standard" and refers to our goal of setting the standard by which all others in our industry are measured. We believe that through our efforts and leadership, we can foster a new level of patient care and professional competence at our affiliated operating subsidiaries, and set a new industry standard for each patient we service. We view healthcare services primarily as a local business. We believe our success is largely driven by our proven ability to build strong relationships with key stakeholders in local healthcare communities, in part, by leveraging our reputation for providing superior care. Accordingly, our brand strategy and organizational structure promotes the empowerment of local leadership and staff to make their facility the “operation of choice” in their community. This is accomplished by allowing local leadership to discern and address the unique needs and priorities of healthcare professionals, customers and other stakeholders in the local community or market, and then work to create a superior service offering for, and reputation in, their particular community. This local empowerment is unique within the healthcare services industry. 
We believe that our localized approach encourages prospective customers and referral sources to choose or recommend the operation. In addition, our leaders are enabled and motivated to share real-time operating data and otherwise benchmark clinical and operational performance against their peers in order to improve clinical care, enhance patient satisfaction and augment operational efficiencies, promoting the sharing of best practices.
We organize our operating subsidiaries into portfolio companies, which we believe has enabled us to maintain a local, field-driven organizational structure, attract additional qualified leadership talent, and to identify, acquire, and improve operations at a generally faster rate. Each of our portfolio companies has its own leader. These leaders, who are generally taken from the ranks of operational CEOs, serve as leadership resources within their own portfolio companies, and have the primary responsibility for recruiting qualified talent, finding potential acquisition targets, and identifying other internal and external growth opportunities. We believe this organizational structure has improved the quality of our recruiting and will continue to facilitate successful acquisitions. 
Since we spun-off our owned real estate properties into a public real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2014, we have continued to expand our real estate portfolio. Following the real estate spin-off, we have acquired and currently own 100 real estate properties, including 32 real estate properties that are leased to a third party under triple-net long-term leases. We manage and operate the remaining real estate properties, including the Service Center location. We are committed to growing our real estate portfolio, which we believe will further enhance our earnings and maximize long-term shareholder value.
On October 1, 2019, we completed the separation of our home health and hospice operations and substantially all of our senior living operations into Pennant, a separate and publicly traded company, through a tax-free distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pennant to Ensign stockholders on a pro rata basis (the Spin-Off). For further details on the Spin-Off, refer to Note 22, Spin-Off Of Subsidiaries, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
To continue with our growth strategy on our real estate portfolio, on January 1, 2022, we formed Standard Bearer REIT. Standard Bearer REIT owns and manages our real estate business. We believe the REIT structure will allow us to better demonstrate the growing value of our owned real estate and provide us with an efficient vehicle for future acquisitions of properties that could be operated by Ensign affiliates or other third parties. We believe this structure will give us new pathways to growth with transactions we would not have considered in the past. Standard Bearer REIT intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2022. The real estate portfolio in Standard Bearer REIT consists of 93 of our 100 owned real estate properties.
SEGMENTS 
We have two reportable segments: (1) skilled services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation therapy services; and (2) real estate, which is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to skilled nursing and senior living operations, including our own operating subsidiaries and third-party operators and are subject to triple-net long-term leases. 
We also report an “all other” category that includes operating results from our senior living operations, mobile diagnostics, transportation and other ancillary operations. Our senior living, mobile diagnostics, transportation and other ancillary operations are neither significant individually, nor in aggregate and therefore do not constitute a reportable segment. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information at the operating segment level. We have presented our segment results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on a comparative basis to conform to the segment structure. For more information about our operating segments, as well as financial information, see Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 7, Business Segments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Skilled Services
As of December 31, 2021, our skilled nursing companies provided skilled nursing care at 236 operations, with 25,032 operational beds, in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. We provide short and long-term nursing care services for patients with chronic conditions, prolonged illness, and the elderly. Our residents are often high-acuity patients that come to our facilities to recover from strokes, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, neurological conditions, joint replacements, and other muscular or skeletal disorders. We use interdisciplinary teams of experienced medical professionals to provide services prescribed by physicians. These medical professionals provide individualized comprehensive nursing care to our short-stay and long-stay patients. Many of our skilled nursing facilities are equipped to provide specialty care, such as on-site dialysis, ventilator care, cardiac and pulmonary management. We also provide standard services such as room and board, special nutritional programs, social services, recreational activities, entertainment, and other services. We are dedicated to ensuring our residents are happy, comfortable, and motivated to achieve their health goals through the provision of quality care. We generate our skilled services revenue from Medicaid, Medicare, managed care, commercial insurance, and private pay. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 46.7% and 28.8% of our skilled services revenue was derived from Medicaid and Medicare programs, respectively. 
Real Estate 
We engage in the acquisition and leasing of skilled nursing and senior living properties. As of December 31, 2021, our owned real estate portfolio was comprised of 100 real estate properties located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. Of these properties, 69 are leased to affiliated skilled nursing facilities, wholly-owned and managed by the Company, 32 are leased to senior living operations, wholly-owned and managed by Pennant, and our Service Center location. The Service Center real estate is leased to our Service Center and numerous third-parties for commercial office space. Of the 32 real estate operations leased to Pennant, two senior living operations are located on the same real estate properties as skilled nursing facilities that the Company owns and operates.
We generate real estate revenue primarily by leasing post-acute care properties we have acquired, to healthcare operators, including our own operating subsidiaries, under triple-net lease arrangements whereby the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance and repair costs, subject to certain exceptions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated rental revenue of $65.5 million, of which $49.6 million was derived from affiliated wholly-owned healthcare facilities. Intercompany rental revenue is eliminated in consolidation, along with corresponding intercompany rent expenses of related healthcare facilities.
Other
Revenue from our senior living operations, mobile diagnostics and other ancillary operations comprise approximately 3.4% of our annual revenue. 
Senior Living. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 2,237 senior living units across 31 operations, of which 22 are located on the same site location as our skilled nursing care operations. Our senior living communities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, and Utah, provide residential accommodations, activities, meals, housekeeping and assistance in the activities of daily living to seniors who are independent or who require some support, but not the level of nursing care provided in a skilled nursing operation. Our independent living units are non-licensed independent living apartments in which residents are independent and require no support with the activities of daily living. 
Substantially all our senior living operations were contributed to Pennant as part of the Spin-Off. Thus, our remaining senior living operations are not significant to our consolidated operations, only comprising approximately 1.8% of our annual revenue. We generate revenue at these units primarily from private pay sources, with a small portion derived from Medicaid or other state-specific programs. Specifically, during the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 86.6% of our senior living revenue was derived from private pay sources. 
Ancillary. As of December 31, 2021, we held a majority membership interest of ancillary operations located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Utah and Washington. We have invested in and are exploring new business lines that are complementary to our existing skilled services and senior living services. These new business lines consist of mobile ancillary services, including digital x-ray, ultrasound, electrocardiograms, sub-acute services and patient transportation to people in their homes or at long-term care facilities. To date these businesses were not meaningful contributors to our operating results.
GROWTH
We have an established track record of successful acquisitions. Much of our historical growth can be attributed to implementing our expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing both under-performing and performing post-acute care operations and transforming them into market leaders in clinical quality, staff competency, employee loyalty and financial performance. With each acquisition, we apply our core operating expertise to improve these operations, both clinically and financially. In years where pricing has been high, we have focused on the integration and improvement of our existing operating subsidiaries while limiting our acquisitions to strategically situated properties.
 From January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2021, we acquired 278 facilities, which added 16,484 operational skilled nursing beds and 5,409 senior living units to our operating subsidiaries, which included the operations that were contributed to Pennant. The following table summarizes cumulative skilled nursing and senior living operation, operational skilled nursing bed and senior living unit counts at the end of 2011 and each of the last five years to reflect our growth over a ten-year period and five-year period as a result of the acquisition of these facilities:

 | | December 31,
 | | 2011(2) | 2017(1)(2) | 2018(2) | | 2019(1)(2) | 2020 | 2021
Cumulative number of skilled nursing and senior living operations | 102 | | 230 | | 244 | | 223 | | 228 | 245 
Cumulative number of operational skilled nursing beds | 9,787 | | 18,870 | | 19,615 | | 22,625 | | 23,172 | 25,032
Cumulative number of senior living units | 1,509 | | 5,011 | | 5,664 | | 2,154 | | 2,254 | 2,237 

(1) Number of operational beds and number of operations for 2017 through 2019 include operational beds and operations that we no longer operated. The number of operations and operational beds do not include the closed facilities beginning in the year of their closures.
(2) Included in the 2011 and 2017-2018 number of operational units and number of operations are the operational units and operations of senior living facilities that we transferred to Pennant as part of the 2019 Spin-Off transaction. In 2019, the number of operations and operational units do not include operations transferred to Pennant.
We have also invested in new business lines that are complementary to our existing businesses, such as ancillary services. We plan to continue to grow our revenue and earnings by: 
•continuing to grow our talent base and develop future leaders;
•increasing the overall percentage or “mix” of higher-acuity patients;
•focusing on organic growth and internal operating efficiencies;
•continuing to acquire additional operations in existing and new markets; 
•expanding and renovating our existing operations, and
•strategically investing in and integrating other post-acute care healthcare businesses.
New Market CEO and New Ventures Programs.  In order to broaden our reach into new markets, and in an effort to provide existing leaders in our company with the entrepreneurial opportunity and challenge of entering a new market and starting a new business, we established our New Market CEO program in 2006. Supported by our Service Center and other resources, a New Market CEO evaluates a target market, develops a comprehensive business plan, and relocates to the target market to find talent and connect with other providers, regulators and the healthcare community in that market, with the goal of ultimately acquiring businesses and establishing an operating platform for future growth. In addition, this program includes other lines of business that are closely related to the skilled nursing industry. For example, we entered into the home health and hospice industry as part of this program, which was a part of the Spin-Off. The New Ventures program encourages our local leaders to evaluate service offerings with the goal of establishing an operating platform in new markets and new businesses. We believe that this program will not only continue to drive growth, but will also provide a valuable training ground for our next generation of leaders, who will have experienced the challenges of growing and operating a new business.
EXPANSIONS
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we expanded our operations and real estate portfolio through a combination of long-term leases and real estate purchases, with the addition of 17 stand-alone skilled nursing operations and five real estate purchases, four of which we previously operated and continue to operate. These new operations added a total of 1,832 operational skilled nursing beds operated by our affiliated operating subsidiaries. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $104.2 million. 
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we expanded our operations and real estate portfolio through a combination of two long-term leases and one real estate purchase, which added three stand-alone skilled nursing operations. These new operations added 379 operational skilled nursing beds to be operated by our affiliated operating subsidiaries. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $27.4 million and we did not assume any liabilities other than the tenant's post-assumption rights and obligations under the long-term leases. We entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior operator as part of each transaction.
For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 8, Operation Expansions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
QUALITY OF CARE MEASURES 
Improvement in Acquired Facilities. In December 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare nursing homes more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating between one and five stars in various categories. We have a strong history of quickly improving the quality of care in the facilities we acquire. Thus, as new assessments are conducted post-acquisition, the star ratings see consistent improvement. At the time of acquisition, the majority of our facilities have 1 and 2-Star ratings. 
Over the last few years, CMS had modified the Star rating requirements. These changes have been significant and made it more difficult to achieve a 4 or 5-Star rating. The 2019 changes resulted in nursing centers losing stars in their "Quality" and "Staffing" ratings, which negatively impacted the "Overall" ratings. Nevertheless, we continue to demonstrate strong performance in the Five-Star Quality Rating System. We believe compliance and quality outcomes are precursors to outstanding financial performance. Thus, we strive to aggressively increase quality and compliance in every facility we acquire, and to adjust our overall policies to adapt to CMS’s changing criteria for the Five-Star Quality Rating System. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS temporarily waived certain reporting timeframes and suspended certain inspections that impacted the underlying data used for calculating star-ratings. This resulted in CMS freezing affected quality measures by only using data collected for periods not impacted by the COVID-19 waivers. CMS continues to change the way the star-rating is calculated, both through ongoing regulation changes and CMS's enactment or expiration of waivers regarding reporting and calculation requirements for five-star ratings. Therefore, depending on the changes, we may experience periods of times where the number of facilities with 4 or 5-Star ratings decline. The star-rating calculations resumed on January 27, 2021. 
The table below summarizes the number of our facilities with 4 and 5-Star ratings since 2017:
 | As of December 31,
 | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | 2020 | 2021
4 and 5-Star Quality Rated skilled nursing facilities | 100 | | 91 | | 102 | | 116 | 114

Above-Average Ratings. Additionally, despite the fact that Ensign’s acquisition of facilities with 1 or 2-Star ratings skews our company-wide ratings, our mean score on the Five-Star Quality Rating System is 67.4%, which exceeds the national average score of 63.0%. 
INDUSTRY TRENDS
The post-acute care industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and long-term healthcare services generated by an aging population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting patient care to lower cost settings. The industry has evolved in recent years, which we believe has led to a number of favorable improvements in the industry, as described below:
•Shift of Patient Care to Lower Cost Alternatives — The growth of the senior population in the U.S. continues to increase healthcare costs, often faster than the available funding from government-sponsored healthcare programs. In response, federal and state governments have adopted cost-containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost-effective settings such as skilled nursing facilities, for which the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals and other post-acute care settings. As a result, skilled nursing facilities are generally serving a larger population of higher-acuity patients than in the past.
•Significant Acquisition and Consolidation Opportunities — The skilled nursing industry is large and highly fragmented, characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. Due to the increasing demands from hospitals and insurance carriers to implement sophisticated and expensive reporting systems, we believe this fragmentation provides us with significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities.
•Improving Supply and Demand Balance — The number of skilled nursing facilities has declined modestly over the past several years. We expect that the supply and demand balance in the skilled nursing industry will continue to improve due to the shift of patient care to lower cost settings, an aging population and increasing life expectancies.
•Increased Demand Driven by Aging Populations — As seniors account for an increasing percentage of the total U.S. population, we believe the demand for skilled nursing and senior living services will continue to increase. According to the census projection released by the U.S. Census Bureau in early 2020, between 2016 and 2030, the number of individuals over 65 years old is projected to be one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population, growing from 16% to 21%. The Bureau expects this segment to increase nearly 50% to 73 million, as compared to the total U.S. population which is projected to increase by 10% over that time period. Furthermore, the generation currently retiring has accumulated less savings than prior generations, creating demand for more affordable senior housing and skilled nursing services. As a high-quality provider in lower cost settings, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
•Transition to Value-Based Payment Models — In response to rising healthcare spending in the United States, commercial, government and other payors are generally shifting away from fee-for-service (FFS) payment models towards value-based models, including risk-based payment models that tie financial incentives to quality, efficiency and coordination of care. We believe that patient-centered outcomes driven reimbursement models will continue to grow in prominence. Many of our operations already receive value-based payments, and as valued-based payment systems continue to increase in prominence, it is our view that our strong clinical outcomes will be increasingly rewarded.
•Accountable Care Organizations and Reimbursement Reform — A significant goal of U.S. federal health care reform is to transform the delivery of health care by changing reimbursement to reflect and support the quality and safety of care that providers deliver, increase efficiency, and reduce growth in spending. Reimbursement models that provide financial incentives to encourage efficiency, affordability, and high-quality care have been developed and implemented by government and commercial third-party payers. The most prolific of these models, the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model, incentivizes groups of providers to share in savings that are achieved through the coordination of care and chronic disease management of an assigned patient population.  Reimbursement methodology reform includes Value-Based Purchasing (VBP), in which a portion of provider reimbursement is redistributed based on relative performance, or improvement on designated economic, clinical quality, and patient satisfaction metrics.  In addition, CMS has implemented Episode-based demonstration, voluntary and mandatory payment initiatives that bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement. These bundled payment models incentivize cross-continuum care coordination and include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in government and commercial health plans. Many of our operations already participate in ACOs. With our focus on quality care and strong clinical outcomes, Ensign is well-positioned to benefit from these outcome-based payment models. 
We believe the post-acute industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. The use of long-term care insurance is increasing among seniors as a means of planning for the costs of skilled nursing services. In addition, as a result of increased mobility in society, reduction of average family size, and the increased number of two-wage earner couples, more residents are looking for alternatives outside the family for their care.
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in occupancy and acuity which are most prominent when comparing the summer and winter months of the calendar year (including volatility arising from COVID-19).
REVENUE SOURCES 

We derive revenue primarily from the Medicaid and Medicare programs, managed care and commercial insurance payors, and private pay patients. The majority of our revenue is derived from skilled nursing, which is highly dependent upon the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Thus, any changes to payment models, reimbursements and budgets impact our revenue, some positively and some negatively. A detailed discussion of the regulatory framework impacting our business is found in the Government Regulation section below. See also, Item 1A., Risk Factors. 
A brief overview of each of our revenue sources is as follows:
Medicaid.  Medicaid is a program financed by state funds and matching federal funds administered by the states and their political subdivisions, and often go by state-specific names, such as Medi-Cal in California and the Arizona Healthcare Cost Containment System in Arizona. Medicaid programs generally provide health benefits for qualifying individuals, and may supplement Medicare benefits for the disabled and for persons aged 65 and older meeting financial eligibility requirements. Medicaid reimbursement formulas are established by each state with the approval of the federal government in accordance with federal guidelines. Seniors who enter skilled nursing facilities as private pay clients can become eligible for Medicaid once they have substantially depleted their assets. Medicaid is generally the largest source of funding for most skilled nursing facilities. 

Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment; case mixed adjusted payments and negotiated rate systems. Rates are subject to a state’s annual budgetary requirements and funding, statutory and regulatory changes and interpretations and rulings by individual state agencies and State Plan Amendments approved by CMS. 
Medicaid typically covers patients that require standard room and board services and provides reimbursement rates that are generally lower than rates earned from other sources. We monitor our payor mix to measure the level received from each payor across each of our business units. We intend to continue to focus on enhancing our care offerings to accommodate more high acuity patients.
Approximately 77.8% of our Medicaid revenue comes from Arizona, California, Texas, and Utah. In California, the state enacted legislation expanding their Medicaid program, which in recent years has continued to see budget increases. It is projected that California General Fund spending on California Medicaid will increase by about $1.6 billion in 2022‑2023, to a total of $31.1 billion. Further, the 2025-2026 estimated California General Fund expenditures on Medicaid will increase to a total of $34.6 billion. In California, reimbursement rates for long term care facilities are calculated based upon the median rate of each peer group, which results in varying reimbursement rates among facilities. Texas is one of the remaining states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Texas lawmakers have, in the past, underfunded Medicaid, requiring an infusion of state and federal funds. Funding for the 2022-2023 Texas biennium includes $25.1 billion in general revenue funds, which is a decrease of $400 million in general funds from the 2020-2021 biennium amounts. In Arizona, the state enacted legislation expanding their Medicaid program in 2013 but has seen decreased Medicaid enrollments in recent years. Their 2021 budget for the state Medicaid program included $1.9 billion from the general fund, and the 2022 budget rose to over $1.92 billion.
Medicare.  Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare benefits to individuals who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled. To achieve and maintain Medicare certification, a skilled nursing facility must sign a Medicare provider agreement and meet the CMS “Conditions of Participation” on an ongoing basis, as determined in periodic facility inspections or “surveys” conducted primarily by the state licensing agency in the state where the facility is located. Medicare pays for inpatient skilled nursing facility services under the prospective payment system (PPS). Under PPS, facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient, per day, for certain services. Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility coverage is limited to 100 days per episode of illness for those beneficiaries who require daily care following discharge from an acute care hospital.
For Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the Medicare Part A coverage, rehabilitation services are included in the per diem payment. For beneficiaries who do not meet the coverage criteria for Part A services, rehabilitation services may qualify for the services to be provided under Medicare Part B. 
Managed Care and Private Insurance.  Managed care patients consist of individuals who are insured by certain third-party entities, or who are Medicare beneficiaries who have assigned their Medicare benefits to a senior managed care organization plan. Another type of insurance, long-term care insurance, is also becoming more available to consumers, but is not expected to contribute significantly to industry revenues in the near term.
Private and Other Payors.  Private and other payors consist primarily of individuals, family members or other third parties who directly pay for the services we provide. 
Rental Revenue. Real estate rental revenue is generated by leasing post-acute care properties that we acquired to healthcare operators under triple-net lease arrangements, whereby the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property, including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs, subject to certain exceptions.
The following charts sets forth our total service revenue by payor source generated by our consolidated operations and skilled services segment as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:

Total skilled nursing | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

REIMBURSEMENT FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES 
Reimbursement for Skilled Nursing Services.  Skilled nursing facility revenue is primarily derived from Medicaid, Medicare, managed care and private payors. Our skilled nursing operations provide Medicaid-covered services to eligible individuals consisting of nursing care, room and board and social services. In addition, states may, at their option, cover other services such as physical, occupational and speech therapies.
Historically, adjustments to reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid have had a significant effect on our revenue and results of operations.  Recently enacted, pending and proposed legislation and administrative rulemaking at the federal and state levels could have similar effects on our business.  Efforts to impose reduced reimbursement rates, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Reimbursement for Rehabilitation Therapy Services.  Rehabilitation therapy revenue is primarily received from private pay, managed care and Medicare for services provided at skilled nursing operations and senior living operations. The payments are based on negotiated patient per diem rates or a negotiated fee schedule based on the type of service rendered. 
Reimbursement for Senior Living.  Senior living facility revenue is primarily derived from private pay patients at rates we established, with only a small portion of such revenue derived from state-specific programs such as Medicaid.
Reimbursement for Other Ancillary Services. Other ancillary revenue, such as mobile diagnostics and medical transportation, is primarily derived from Medicare Part B, Medicaid, managed care and private payors at rates we establish based upon the services we provide and market conditions in the area of operation.
RENTAL REVENUE
Rental revenue from third party rental property tenants. Owned properties are leased pursuant to non-cancelable operating leases, generally with an initial term of 10 to 15 years. All of the post-acute care healthcare properties leased to third parties contain renewal options. The leases provide for fixed minimum base rent during the initial and renewal periods. The majority of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and those increases are generally computed on a calculation based on the Consumer Price Index. 
Each lease is a triple net lease which requires the lessee to pay all taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, capital and non-capital expenditures and other costs necessary in the operations of the facilities. In addition, our leases with third-parties are typically structured as master leases. The master leases consist of multiple leases, each with its own pool of properties, that have varying maturities and diversity in property geography. 
If a lessee makes payments for taxes and insurance directly to a third-party on our behalf, we are required to exclude these payments from variable payments and from revenue recognition in our consolidated statements of income. Otherwise, tenant reimbursements paid to us for taxes and insurance are classified as additional rental revenue recognized by us on a gross basis.
Rental revenue from Ensign-affiliated tenants. Rental revenue from Ensign-affiliated operations is based on mutually agreed-upon base rents that are subject to change from time to time. Intercompany revenue is eliminated in consolidation, along with the corresponding intercompany rent expenses of the related healthcare facilities. 
COMPETITION 

The post-acute care industry is highly competitive, and we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. The industry is highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional providers, in addition to large national providers that have achieved geographic diversity and economies of scale. Our operating subsidiaries also compete with inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals. Increasingly, we are competing with home health and community-based providers who have developed programs designed to provide services to seniors outside a facility-based setting, potentially decreasing the time they need the higher level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility. Competitiveness may vary significantly from location to location, depending upon factors such as the number of competing facilities, availability of services, expertise of staff, and the physical appearance and amenities of each location. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the post-acute care industry are: 
•ability to attract and to retain qualified management and caregivers;
•reputation and achievements of quality healthcare outcomes;
•attractiveness and location of facilities;
•the expertise and commitment of the management team and employees; and
•community value, including amenities and ancillary services.


We seek to compete effectively in each market by establishing a reputation within the local community as the “operation of choice.” This means that the operation leaders are generally free to discern and address the unique needs and priorities of healthcare professionals, customers and other stakeholders in the local community or market, and then create a superior service offering and reputation for that particular community or market that is calculated to encourage prospective customers and referral sources to choose or recommend the operation. 

Increased competition could limit our ability to attract and retain patients, maintain or increase rates or to expand our business. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, may have greater brand recognition and may be more established in their respective communities than we are. Competing companies may also offer newer facilities or different programs or services than we offer, and may therefore attract individuals who are currently patients of our facilities, 
potential patients of our facilities, or who are otherwise receiving our healthcare services. Other competitors may have lower expenses or other competitive advantages than us and, therefore, provide services at lower prices than we offer. 
Our other services, such as senior living facilities and other ancillary services, also compete with local, regional, and national companies. The primary competitive factors in these businesses are similar to those for our skilled nursing facilities and include reputation, cost of services, quality of clinical services, responsiveness to patient/resident needs, location and the ability to provide support in other areas such as third-party reimbursement, information management and patient recordkeeping.
Our real estate segment competes for real property investments with healthcare providers, healthcare-related REITs, real estate partnerships, banks, private equity funds, venture capital funds and other investors. Some of these competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than us. Our ability to compete successfully for real property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and our cost of capital in the event an acquisition requires debt or equity financing.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the ongoing changes within our industry. We believe that our ability to acquire, integrate and improve our facilities is a direct result of the following key competitive strengths: 
 Experienced and Dedicated Employees.  We believe that our operating subsidiaries' employees are among the best in their respective industries. We believe each of our operating subsidiaries is led by an experienced and caring leadership team, including dedicated front-line care staff, who participates daily in the clinical and operational improvement of their individual operations. We have been successful in attracting, training, incentivizing and retaining a core group of outstanding business and clinical leaders to spearhead our operating subsidiaries. These leaders operate as separate local businesses. With broad local control, these talented leaders and their care staffs are able to quickly meet the needs of their patients and residents, employees and local communities, without waiting for permission to act or being bound to a “one-size-fits-all” corporate strategy. 
 Unique Incentive Programs.  We believe that our employee compensation programs are unique within the industry. Employee stock options and performance bonuses, based on achieving target clinical quality, cultural, compliance and financial benchmarks, represent a significant component of total compensation for our operational leaders. We believe that these compensation programs assist us in encouraging our leaders and key employees to act with a shared ownership mentality. Furthermore, our leaders are motivated to help local operations within a defined “cluster” and "market," which is a group of geographically proximate operations that share clinical best practices, real-time financial data and other resources and information. 
 Staff and Leadership Development.  We have a company-wide commitment to ongoing education, training and professional development. Accordingly, our operational leaders participate in regular training. Most participate in training sessions at Ensign University, our in-house educational system. Other training opportunities are generally offered via on-demand training tools, including podcasts. In addition, we offer weekly cultural and interactive educational topics including leadership development, our values, updates on Medicaid and Medicare billing requirements, updates on new regulations or legislation, infection control, COVID-19 clinical and regulations, emerging healthcare service alternatives and other relevant clinical, business and industry specific coursework. Additionally, we encourage and provide ongoing education classes for our clinical staff to maintain licensing and increase the breadth of their knowledge and expertise. We believe that our commitment to, and substantial investment in, ongoing education will further strengthen the quality of our operational leaders and staff, and the quality of the care they provide to our patients and residents.
 Innovative Service Center Approach.  We do not maintain a corporate headquarters; rather, we operate a Service Center to support the efforts of each operation. Our Service Center is a dedicated service organization that acts as a resource and provides centralized information technology, human resources, accounting, payroll, legal, risk management, educational and other back office support services, so that local leaders can focus on delivering top-quality care and efficient business operations. Our Service Center approach allows individual operations to function with the strength, synergies and economies of scale found in larger organizations, but without what we believe are the disadvantages of a top-down management structure or corporate hierarchy. We believe our Service Center approach is unique within the industry, and allows us to preserve the “one-operation-at-a-time” focus and culture that has contributed to our success. 
Proven Track Record of Successful Acquisitions.  We have established a disciplined acquisition strategy that is focused on selectively acquiring operations within our target markets. Our acquisition strategy is driven by our operations team. 
Prospective leaders are included in the decision-making process and compensated as these acquired operations reach pre-established clinical quality and financial benchmarks, helping to ensure that we only undertake acquisitions that key leaders believe can become clinically sound and contribute to our financial performance. 
As of December 31, 2021, we have expanded to 245 facilities with an aggregate of 25,032 operational skilled nursing beds and 2,237 senior living units, through both long-term leases and purchases. We believe our experience in acquiring these operations and our demonstrated success in significantly improving their operations enables us to consider a broad range of acquisition targets. In addition, we believe we have developed expertise in transitioning newly acquired operations to our unique organizational culture and systems, which enables us to acquire operations with limited disruption to patients, residents and operating staff, while significantly improving quality of care. We have also constructed new facilities to target demand, which exists for high-end healthcare facilities when we determine that market conditions justify the cost of new construction in some of our markets. 
Successful Real Estate Investment Strategy. We maintain a portfolio of long-term healthcare facilities of high-quality assets diversified by geographic location and operated by a diverse group of established healthcare providers. We are focused on selectively acquiring real estate properties based on our industry experience and opportunistic strategy, which we believe provides us with greater investment and purchasing opportunities. Due to our credit strength, we have the ability to acquire large portfolios of real estate properties; a portion of which can be managed and operated by our Ensign affiliated established healthcare leaders and a portion of which can be leased to third parties. 
As of December 31, 2021, our real estate portfolio consists of 100 owned facilities, which include properties leased to and operated by third parties and properties we managed and operated. We believe our real estate investment strategy has allowed us to accumulate a portfolio that aids our healthcare operators in improving performance and generating additional returns through leases with third parties. 

Reputation for Quality Care.  We believe that we have achieved a reputation for high-quality and cost-effective care and services to our patients and residents within the communities we serve. We believe that our achievement of quality outcomes enhances our reputation for quality, that when coupled with the integrated services that we offer, allows us to attract patients that require more intensive and medically complex care and generally result in higher reimbursement rates than lower acuity patients. 

Community Focused Approach.  We view our services primarily as a local, community-based business. Our local leadership-centered management culture enables each operation's nursing support staff and leaders to meet the unique needs of their patients and local communities. We believe that our commitment to this “one-operation-at-a-time” philosophy helps to ensure that each operation, its patients, their family members and the community will receive the individualized attention they need. By serving our patients, their families, the community and our fellow healthcare professionals, we strive to make each individual business the operation of choice in its local community. 

We further believe that when choosing a healthcare provider, consumers usually choose a person or people they know and trust, rather than a corporation or business. Therefore, rather than pursuing a traditional organization-wide branding strategy, we actively seek to develop the operations brand at the local level, serving and marketing one-on-one to caregivers, our patients, their families, the community and our fellow healthcare professionals in the local market. 
Investment in Information Technology.  We utilize information technology that enables our operational leaders to access, and to share with their peers, both clinical and financial performance data in real time. Armed with relevant and current information, our operation leaders and their management teams are able to share best practices and the latest information, adjust to challenges and opportunities on a timely basis, improve quality of care, mitigate risk and improve both clinical outcomes and financial performance. We have also invested in specialized healthcare technology systems to assist our nursing and support staff. We have installed software and touch-screen interface systems in each operation to enable our clinical staff to more efficiently monitor and deliver patient care and record patient information. We believe these systems have improved the quality of our medical and billing records, while improving the productivity of our staff.
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
We believe that the following strategies are primarily responsible for our growth to date, and will continue to drive the growth of our business: 

Grow Talent Base and Develop Future Leaders.  Our primary growth strategy is to expand our talent base and develop future leaders. A key component of our organizational culture is our belief that strong local leadership is a primary key to the success of each operation. While we believe that significant acquisition opportunities exist, we have generally followed a disciplined approach to growth that permits us to acquire an operation only when we believe, among other things, that we will have qualified leadership for that operation. To develop these leaders, we have a rigorous “CEO-in-Training Program” that attracts proven business leaders from various industries and backgrounds, and provides them the knowledge and hands-on training they need to successfully lead one of our operating subsidiaries. We generally have between 25 and 30 prospective administrators progressing through the various stages of this training program, which is generally much more rigorous, hands-on and intensive than the minimum 1,000 hours of training mandated by the licensing requirements of most states where we do business. Once administrators are licensed and assigned to an operation, they continue to learn and develop in our operational Chief Executive Officer Program (CEO Program), which facilitates the continued development of these talented business leaders into outstanding operational chief executive officers, through regular peer review, our Ensign University and on-the-job training. 

In addition, our Chief Operating Officer Program (COO Program) recruits and trains highly qualified Directors of Nursing to lead the clinical programs in our operations. Working together with their operational CEO and/or administrator, other key operational leaders and front-line staff, these experienced nurses manage delivery of care and other clinical personnel and programs to optimize both clinical outcomes and employee and patient satisfaction. 

Increase Mix of High Acuity Patients.  Many skilled nursing facilities are serving an increasingly larger population of patients who require a high level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care, whom we refer to as high acuity patients, as a result of government and other payors seeking lower-cost alternatives to traditional acute-care hospitals. We generally receive higher reimbursement rates for providing care for these medically complex patients. In addition, many of these patients require therapy and other rehabilitative services, which we are able to provide as part of our integrated service offerings. Where higher complex services are medically necessary and prescribed by a patient's physician or other appropriate healthcare professional, we generally receive additional revenue in connection with the provision of those services. By making these integrated services available to such patients, and maintaining established clinical standards in the delivery of those services, we are able to increase our overall revenues. We believe that we can continue to attract high acuity patients to our operations by maintaining and enhancing our reputation for quality care and continuing our community focused approach. 

Focus on Organic Growth and Internal Operating Efficiencies.  We plan to continue to grow organically by focusing on increasing patient occupancy within our existing operations. Although some of the facilities we have acquired were in good physical and operating condition, the majority have been clinically and financially troubled, with some facilities having had occupancy rates as low as 30% at the time of acquisition. Additionally, we believe that incremental operating margins on the last 20% of our beds/units are significantly higher than on the first 80%, offering opportunities to improve financial performance within our existing facilities. Our overall occupancy is impacted significantly by the number of facilities acquired and the operational occupancy on the acquisition date. Therefore, consolidated occupancy will vary significantly based on these factors. Our average occupancy rates for our skilled nursing facilities was 72.8% and 73.5% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our average occupancy rates in 2021 and 2020 have been negatively impacted by surges in COVID-19 caused by COVID-19 variants.

We also believe we can generate organic growth by improving operating efficiencies and the quality of care at the patient level. By focusing on staff development, clinical systems and the efficient delivery of quality patient care, we believe we are able to deliver higher quality care at lower costs than many of our competitors. 
Historically, we have achieved incremental occupancy and revenue growth by creating or expanding clinical service offerings in existing operations. For example, by expanding clinical programs to provide outpatient therapy services in many markets, we are able to increase revenue while spreading the fixed costs of maintaining these programs over a larger patient base. Outpatient therapy has also proven to be an effective marketing tool, raising the visibility of our facilities in their local communities and enhancing the reputation of our facilities with short-stay rehabilitation patients. 
Add New Facilities and Expand Existing Facilities.  One of our growth strategies includes the acquisition of new and existing facilities from third parties and the expansion and upgrade of current facilities. In the near term, we plan to take advantage of the fragmented skilled nursing industry by acquiring operations within select geographic markets and may consider the construction of new facilities. In addition, we have targeted facilities that we believed were performing and operations that were underperforming, where we believed we could improve service delivery, occupancy rates and cash flow. With experienced leaders in place at the community level and demonstrated success in significantly improving operating conditions at acquired facilities, we believe that we are well positioned for continued growth. While the integration of 
underperforming facilities generally has a negative short-term effect on overall operating margins, these facilities are typically accretive to earnings within 12 to 18 months following their acquisition. For the 232 facilities that we acquired from 2001 through 2021, the aggregate EBITDAR as a percentage of revenue improved from 11.8% during the first full three months of operations to 15.7% during the thirteenth through fifteenth months of operation and to 18.8% during the 45th quarter of operation. 
Real Estate Portfolio Growth. An important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our real estate portfolio through accretive acquisition and investment opportunities in healthcare properties. Our execution of this strategy hinges on our ability to successfully identify, secure and consummate beneficial transactions. We have a proven track record of acquiring properties that we have determined are investment opportunities and develop these into thriving properties that are well-suited for operational purposes. We then use these properties for our skilled nursing or assisted living operations or we lease the properties to other long-term care facility operators. We expect that our newly formed REIT structure will allow us to expand our real estate footprint while bringing the best operational practices to our own and other operators in the industry. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 25,900 full-time equivalent employees who were employed by our Service Center and our operating subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 60.0% of our total expenses were payroll related. Periodically, market forces, which vary by region, require that we increase wages in excess of general inflation or in excess of increases in reimbursement rates we receive. We believe that we staff appropriately, focusing primarily on the acuity level and day-to-day needs of our patients and residents. In most of the states where we operate, our skilled nursing facilities are subject to state mandated minimum staffing ratios, so our ability to reduce costs by decreasing staff, notwithstanding decreases in acuity or need, is limited and subject to government audits and penalties in some states. We seek to manage our labor costs by improving staff retention, improving operating efficiencies, maintaining competitive wage rates and benefits and reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services. Our Chief Human Capital Officer reports to our Board of Directors and oversees the following human capital initiatives:
Our Culture. The operation of our skilled nursing and senior living facilities requires a large number of highly skilled healthcare professionals and support staff. Our employees are at the heart of our Company and we are committed to their health, professional development and workplace satisfaction. Our core values, which focuses on developing our employees, fostering an ownership mentality and allowing for intelligent risk taking, guide us in our decision making and inspire us to be better people, both professionally and personally.

Compensation and Benefits. The healthcare industry as a whole has been experiencing shortages of qualified professional clinical staff. We believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified professional clinical staff stems from our ability to offer attractive wage and benefits packages, a high level of employee training, an empowered culture that provides incentives for individual efforts and a quality work environment. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We value diversity in our recruiting, hiring and career development practices. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunity and fair treatment to all individuals based on merit and without discriminations. 
Training and Development. We provide training and development to all employees. We have many training programs at all levels such as our CEO in Training, Director of Nursing in Training, Preceptors, Young Gun Program, weekly culture trainings, boot camps and annual meetings, where we focus on both career and professional development. 
Social Sustainability. We continuously working toward bridging the gap between what the healthcare system currently provides and the basic needs of individuals. We aim to have an enduring impact on the communities in which we live and work. Elevate Charities is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to elevating the condition and quality of life for members of the senior healthcare community - employees, caregivers, family members, patients and residents. Elevate Charities has three unique funds: Heritage Fund, Heritage Scholarship Fund and the Emergency Fund. 
The Heritage Fund and the Heritage Scholarship Fund engage in a mission to enhance the quality of life for seniors in our communities through caring service, fulfilling essential needs and providing education to caregivers. The Heritage Fund helps the caregiver identify specific and practical ways to meet the needs of those under their care. This can help provide a better life, improved experience and greater satisfaction for our aging population. The financial support provided by the Heritage Fund benefits seniors directly. In addition, the Heritage Scholarship Fund helps qualified clinical professionals who may not be able to afford to advance in the field of long-term care. Through grants and scholarships, the fund helps these qualified professionals gain the education needed to advance in the field of senior-focused healthcare. Since 2019, we awarded 97 scholarships to employees in our workforce. 
Lastly, the Emergency Fund is a way of passing the hat to help our co-workers whose lives are affected by tragedy. This program is funded for Company team members by the Company team members. All Company team members can contribute to the fund either through a one-time donation or by recurring payroll deduction. In 2021, over 19,800, or 76% of our employees employed by our operating subsidiaries contributed to the Emergency Fund. In 2021, we distributed approximately $2.0 million in grants to 1,819 members of our Ensign-affiliated family. To date, the Emergency Fund has distributed over 8,400 grants totaling almost $10.0 million to members of our Ensign-affiliated family in their time of need. 
COVID-19. Our employees nationwide have been on the front lines in the battle against COVID-19. When it would have been easier to simply hunker down and wait for the challenges to pass, the heroes in our operations continued to provide selfless service to all their patients, including COVID patients. To recognize these front-line workers, our company, along with each individual operating subsidiary, provided financial awards to our employees for their tirelessly daily efforts to provide outstanding care to each resident they serve. We are beyond grateful for their enormous efforts and will continue to recognize the sacrifices of these employees as we navigate through the pandemic. Additionally, to date, we granted $0.7 million from the Emergency Fund for our employees in need as a result of COVID-19.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
General 
Healthcare is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant impact on revenue, costs and business operations. Our independent, operating subsidiaries that provide healthcare services are subject to federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, licensure, quality and adequacy of care, physical plant requirements, life safety, personnel and operating policies. In addition, these same subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws that govern billing and reimbursement, relationships with vendors and business relationships with physicians, and workplace protection for healthcare staff. Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statue, the federal False Claims Act (FCA), the Stark Law, the Health Care Emergency Temporary Standard, and state corporate practice of medicine statutes. 
Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect the skilled nursing facilities, senior living facilities and outpatient rehabilitation agencies of our independent operating subsidiaries to verify continued compliance with applicable regulations and standards. The operations must pass these inspections to remain licensed under state laws and to comply with Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements. The operations can only participate in these third-party payment programs if inspections by regulatory authorities reveal that the operations are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements. In the ordinary course of business, federal or state regulatory authorities may issue notices to the operations alleging deficiencies in certain regulatory practices. These statements of deficiency may require corrective action to regain and maintain compliance. In some cases, federal or state regulators may impose other remedies including imposition of civil monetary penalties, temporary payment bans, loss of certification as a provider in the Medicare or Medicaid program, or revocation of a state operating license. 
We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry subjects providers to intense scrutiny. In the ordinary course of business, providers are subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies related to compliance with participation and payment rules under government payment programs. These inquiries may originate from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), state Medicaid agencies, state Attorney Generals, local and state ombudsman offices and CMS Recovery Audit Contractors, among other agencies. In response to the inquiries, investigations and audits, the federal and state governments continue to impose citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory penalties, including demands for refund of overpayments, expanded civil monetary penalties that extend over long periods of time and date back to incidents prior to surveyor visits, Medicare and Medicaid payment bans and terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We vigorously contest each such regulatory outcome when appropriate; however, there are significant legal and other expenses involved that consume our financial and personnel resources. Expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business, financial condition or the results of operations.
Coronavirus 
In an effort to promote efficient care delivery and to decrease the spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local regulators have implemented new regulations and waived (in some cases, temporarily) certain existing regulations, including those set forth below.
Temporary suspension of certain patient coverage criteria and documentation and care requirements - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) and a series of temporary waivers and guidance issued by CMS suspended various Medicare patient coverage criteria to ensure patients continue to have adequate access to care, notwithstanding the burdens placed on healthcare providers as related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these regulatory waivers were issued pursuant to Section 1135 of the Social Security Act, which authorizes the HHS Secretary to temporarily waive or modify Medicare and Medicaid requirements for affected health care providers and facilities following the declaration of a public health emergency (Section 1135 Waivers). HHS also waived requirements specific to skilled nursing facilities pursuant to its authority under Section 1812(f) of the Social Security Act (Section 1812(f) Waiver, and together with the Section 1135 Waivers, the Emergency Waivers). While many of the Emergency Waivers are expected to last throughout the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, CMS ended several Emergency Waivers effective May 10, 2021. Due to the prevalence of waves of COVID-19 variants in 2021 and continuing into 2022, it is unclear when the remaining Emergency Waivers will expire, or whether previously expired Emergency Waivers will be reinstated. On January 14, 2022, the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) was extended until at least April 16, 2022. 
Examples of requirements that were waived due to the COVID-19 emergency declaration include the following: (1) approving temporary expansion sites to ensure that local hospitals and health systems have the capacity to handle a potential surge of COVID-19 patients (e.g. CMS Hospital Without Walls); (2) removing barriers to practice for physicians, nurses, and other clinicians from the community or from other states to allow healthcare systems to provide clinical and workforce support where needed; (3) increasing access to telehealth and corresponding reimbursement through Medicare to ensure patients have access to healthcare while remaining safe at home; (4) expanding in-place COVID-19 testing to allow for more testing at home or in community based settings; and (5) temporarily waiving certain documentation, reporting and audit requirements to allow providers, health care facilities, Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D plans, and states to focus on the provision of care (e.g., Patients Over Paperwork). Many states have also waived regulations to ease regulatory burdens on the healthcare industries. It remains uncertain when federal and state regulators will resume enforcement of those regulations, which remain waived or are otherwise not being enforced during the public health emergency. We believe these regulatory actions could contribute to changes in skilled mix, which may have been different without the existence of the waivers. 
Pursuant to the Emergency Waivers, CMS also authorized temporary waivers on medical review requirements, effective March 1, 2020, for the duration of the public health emergency. In addition, CMS is re-prioritizing scheduled program audits and contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits for MA organizations, Part D sponsors, Medicare-Medicaid Plans, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly organizations. Re-prioritizing these audit activities allows providers, CMS and organizations to focus on patient care.
In July 2020, CMS updated its COVID-19 Provider Burden Relief Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) related to claim audit waivers for multiple services. On March 30, 2020, CMS suspended most Medicare FFS medical reviews because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included pre-payment medical reviews conducted by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) under the Targeted Probe and Educate program and post-payment reviews conducted by the MACs, Supplemental Medical Review Contractors (SMRC), and Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC). CMS authorized MACs to resume these audit activities beginning on August 3, 2020, regardless of the status of the public health emergency. All reviews will be conducted in accordance with statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as related billing and coding requirements. Available waivers and flexibilities for the claims selected for review will also be applied. In December of 2021, CMS issued a 2019 Novel Coronavirus Medicare Provider Enrollment Relief FAQ document, which addressed Medicare enrollment and re-enrollment during the ongoing public health emergency. Within this December 2021 FAQ, CMS indicated that it would resume collecting application fees in 2021 and revalidating enrollees in 2022.
Under the Emergency Waivers, CMS is also allowing skilled nursing facilities to provide a skill-in-place program for Medicare beneficiaries who are residents of the skilled nursing facilities that meet the skill-in-place criteria, foregoing the usual three-day qualifying hospital stay. This waiver remains valid for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. As patients qualify for skill-in-place for Medicare Part A stays, we could see a decrease in long-term care Medicare Part B programs. 
On August 24, 2020, CMS released a Medicaid Informational Bulletin providing guidance to states on flexibilities that are available to increase reimbursement for nursing facilities implementing specific infection control practices. On September 8, 2021, CMS clarified that CMS's waivers do not waive or change other requirements for SNF coverage under Medicare, including the SNF level of care criteria, which is unchanged by the public health emergency. CMS used this update of its March 16, 2021 Medicare FFS Response to the PHE on COVID-19 article to further clarify that CMS will review and take action in connection with SNF admissions that do not satisfy SNF level of care criteria that existed prior to the public health emergency and CMS's institution of applicable waivers that facilitated payment for SNF services. 
Resuming visitation and resident rights — CMS has issued guidance to facilities throughout the public health emergency regarding patients’ rights to visitation. While the CMS guidance issued in March 2020 directed that facilities severely restrict visitation, CMS has subsequently provided guidance through the course of the pandemic (and most recently updated in November 2021 and January 2022) that broadens visitation and provides guidance on visitation procedures. 
Testing requirements — Beginning in April 2020, authorities in several states in which our independent operating subsidiaries are located began to mandate widespread COVID-19 testing at all nursing home and long-term care facilities. This came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that older adults are at a higher risk for serious illness from the coronavirus and issued updated testing guidelines for nursing homes. Some of these states were also publicly reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in facilities. On July 22, 2020, CMS announced that nursing homes in states with a 5% or greater positivity rate for COVID-19 will be required to test all nursing home staff each week. On August 26, 2020, CMS issued new parameters for testing, requiring routine monthly testing of all facility staff if the facility’s county positivity rate is less than 5%; weekly testing if the county positivity rate is between 5% and 10%; and twice weekly testing if the county positivity rate exceeds 10%. On April 27, 2021, CMS again issued revised parameters for testing, specifying that the requirement for routine testing of staff applies only to those staff members that are unvaccinated - fully vaccinated staff do not have to be routinely tested. On September 9, 2021, the Biden-Harris administration (the Administration) announced a forthcoming interim final rule (IFR) that would require all workers in Medicare and Medicaid participating health facilities to be fully vaccinated. 
On November 5, 2021, CMS issued the Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination IFR, requiring all eligible staff to receive their first dose of a two-dose primary vaccination series by December 5, 2021, and the second dose of a two-dose primary vaccination series by January 4, 2022. CMS's enforcement of this IFR was temporarily blocked in certain states pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court entered an order allowing CMS's enforcement of the IFR and its vaccination requirements by March 15, 2022 for skilled nursing and long term facilities in (among other states) Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina and Utah and by February 28, 2022 for all other states except Texas. On January 20, 2022, the authority of CMS to enforce the IFR in Texas was affirmed and CMS set a deadline of March 21, 2022 for full compliance with its vaccination requirements. The routine testing requirements are in addition to obligations to screen staff each shift, residents daily, and all persons entering the facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Facilities must test any staff or resident, regardless of vaccination status, who has signs or symptoms of COVID-19. In the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in the facility, all staff and residents must be tested at regular intervals until repeat testing identifies no new cases of COVID-19 infection among staff or residents for a 14-day period. Additional guidance may be issued in connection with the forthcoming IFRs regarding mandatory worker vaccinations expected by CMS for Medicare and Medicaid-participating facilities, which may also contain provisions affecting the testing and vaccination of residents. In addition to CMS's testing mandates, some states have imposed their own testing requirements for residents and staff, or are enforcing testing mandates under existing or expanded workplace safety regulations. 
In addition to the IFR mandating vaccinations for health facility workers by CMS and vaccinations, several states where our independent operating facilities are located have issued vaccine mandates that apply to facility employees. As discussed in greater detail below in Item 1A., Risk Factors, the United States Supreme Court has halted enforcement of OSHA's vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard (ETS). California, the most populous state, issued an order on August 5, 2021, requiring workers in nursing homes and other health facilities to receive at least one vaccine dose by September 30, 2021. California's Department of Public Health expanded its mandate on September 28, 2021, requiring adult care facilities and direct care workers to be vaccinated as well, and for all affected workers to be fully vaccinated (including both shots of the two-shot Pfizer or Moderna vaccination course) by November 30, 2021. On August 20, 2021, the State of Washington’s governor issued a proclamation requiring workers in long-term care facilities and healthcare settings—including employees, contractors, and volunteers—to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by October 2021. On August 30, 2021, the Colorado Board of Health approved a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for employees, contractors, and other individuals working in certain health care facilities including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, mandating that these workers be fully vaccinated by October 2021, which was extended by 120 days on December 15, 2021. Additionally, none of these states have been enjoined from enforcing their respective mandates. Non-compliance with state or federal mandates may result in imposition of fines or other administrative action. Compliance with these federal and state vaccine mandates, whether a result of changes in law, regulation, 
or the result of an executive or agency order, may be difficult due to legal challenges and differing requirements imposed by numerous authorities.
Reporting requirements — Effective May 8, 2020, CMS published an IFR requiring skilled nursing facilities to report information related to COVID-19 cases among facility residents and staff directly to the CDC National Health Safety Network no less than weekly; the reported information is made publicly available on a dedicated website. In addition, skilled nursing facilities are required to inform residents, their families and representatives of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their facilities. This resident/family/representative notification is required to take place by 5:00 p.m. (local time) the next calendar day following the occurrence of: (1) a single confirmed infection of COVID-19, or (2) three or more residents or staff with new-onset of respiratory symptoms that occur within 72 hours of one another. 
Effective May 21, 2021, CMS published an IFR requiring long-term care facilities to report weekly COVID-19 vaccination data of both residents and staff to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network. Facilities are also required to provide residents and staff with vaccine education and offer vaccines, when available, to residents and staff. CMS may initiate enforcement activities and assess civil monetary penalties for not meeting any of these COVID-19 related requirements. 
Effective June 11, 2021, HHS revised the Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements which are applicable to recipients of Provider Relief Funds. The revised requirements provide additional information on the data elements that recipients are required to report as part of the post-payment reporting process, as well as the timing of such reporting. 
Effective August 23, 2021, CMS published an IFR incorporating comments on its May 21, 2021 IFR which continued the obligation for long-term care and intermediate care facilities to report COVID-19 vaccination data for both residents and staff to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network. This new IFR requires facilities to develop policies and procedures to ensure the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff, and to educate residents and staff concerning the benefits, risks, and potential side effects associated with the vaccine. This IFR also addresses responses to vaccination refusal by residents and staff in compliance with U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance. CMS may initiate enforcement activities and assess civil monetary penalties for not meeting any of these COVID-19 related reporting requirements under this IFR. We do not believe these COVID-19 related requirements will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Survey Activity and Enforcement — On March 20, 2020, CMS announced the initiation of focused infection control surveys intended to assess long-term care facility compliance with infection control requirements in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. CMS prioritized infection control surveys over annual recertification and complaint surveys at the non-immediate jeopardy level, confirming its commitment to infection prevention and control in the skilled nursing industry. Effective August 17, 2020, CMS provided guidance authorizing resumption of traditional survey activity. 
On June 1, 2020 (and subsequently updated in January 2021), CMS introduced an enhanced enforcement program with respect to infection control deficiencies. The program contemplates more significant remedies against facilities with a prior history of infection control deficiencies and imposes more stringent penalties with deficiencies identified at a higher scope and severity. The spectrum of remedies available to CMS for imposition on skilled nursing facilities in connection with this enhancement includes increased monetary fines, shortened time periods to return to compliance, and other administrative penalties. 
Federal COVID-19 Vaccination Program — On December 11, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, followed by the second EUA for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 28, 2020, and the third EUA for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on February 27, 2021. Vaccine distribution is now widespread in all 50 states. 
On August 18, 2021, the Administration announced that CMS was developing an emergency regulation requiring all workers within Medicare and Medicaid-participating nursing homes to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Administration expanded the scope of this forthcoming emergency regulation on September 9, 2021, and on the same day the Administration announced that OSHA would introduce a rule requiring employers with more than 100 employees to mandate that its employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing for the virus. As further discussed below in Item 1A., Risk Factors, both CMS’s IFR and OSHA’s ETS for vaccination were challenged in court and halted from enforcement in certain states. On January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court halted any enforcement of OSHA’s rule but allowed CMS’s enforcement of the IFR and its vaccination requirements by March 15, 2022 for skilled nursing and long term care facilities in Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina and Utah and by February 28, 2022 for skilled nursing and long term care facilities in all other states except in Texas. On January 20, 2022, Texas ended its litigation against CMS’sm enforcement of the IFR, and CMS published guidance that employees of affected health facilities in that State must receive a first vaccination dose by February 19, 2022 and any second dose by March 21, 2022, or apply for and receive exemptions within those timeframes. 
Through a series of amendments to the EUA beginning in 2021 through early January 2022, the FDA approved and the CDC recommended the use of a single booster of the vaccines to be administered to individuals 12 years and older, at least six months after completing the primary vaccination series of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or two months after completing the primary Johnson & Johnson vaccination. 
Medicare
Medicare presently accounts for approximately 28.8% of our skilled nursing services revenue year-to-date, being our second-largest payor. The Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services. Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins. 
Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM)
The Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (SNF PPS) Rule became effective October 1, 2019. The SNF PPS Rule includes a new case-mix model that focuses on the patient’s condition (clinically relevant factors) and resulting care needs, rather than on the volume of care provided, to determine Medicare reimbursement. The case mix-model is called the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM), which utilizes clinically relevant factors for determining Medicare payment by using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes and other patient characteristics as the basis for patient classification. PDPM utilizes five case-mix adjusted payment components: physician therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, nursing and social services and non-therapy ancillary services. It also uses a sixth non-case mix component to cover utilization of skilled nursing facilities resources that do not vary depending on resident characteristics.
PDPM replaces the existing case-mix classification methodology, Resource Utilization Groups, Version IV. The structure of PDPM moves Medicare towards a more value-based, unified post-acute care payment system. For example, PDPM adjusts Medicare payments based on each aspect of a resident’s care, thereby more accurately addressing costs associated with medically complex patients. PDPM also removes therapy minutes as the basis for therapy payment. Finally, PDPM adjusts the skilled nursing facilities per diem payments to reflect varying costs throughout the stay, through the physician therapy, occupational therapy and non-therapy ancillary services components.
In addition, PDPM is intended to reduce paperwork requirements for performing patient assessments. Under the SNF PPS PDPM system, the payment to skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes is based heavily on the patient’s condition rather than the specific services provided by each skilled nursing facility. On August 4, 2021, CMS published the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2022, which included a 1.2% net market basket increase in payment to SNFs, and reduced the negative impact of readmissions for providers with more than 25 stays by returning 60% of the 2% withheld by CMS regardless of that provider’s performance measures. Providers with lower volume and fewer than 25 stays will not have any adjustments made to their payment.
Skilled Nursing Facility - Quality Reporting Program (SNF QRP)
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) imposed new data reporting requirements for certain Post-Acute-Care (PAC) providers. The IMPACT Act requires that each skilled nursing facility submit their quality measures data. Beginning with fiscal year 2018, and each subsequent year, if a skilled nursing facility does not submit required quality data, their payment rates are reduced by 2.0% for each such fiscal year. Application of the 2.0% reduction may result in payment rates for a fiscal year being less than the preceding fiscal year. In addition, reporting-based reductions to the market basket increase factor will not be cumulative; they will only apply for the fiscal year involved. A skilled nursing facility's MAC will issue the facility a notice of non-compliance if it does not satisfy its Quality Reporting Program reporting requirements.
Updated performance measures mandated for the SNF QRP for fiscal year 2020 were established in the final SNF PPS rule adopted on August 8, 2019 (fiscal year 2020 SNF PPS Rule). The final rule continues implementation of the SNF QRP measures to improve program interoperability, operational quality and safety. Specifically, the rule adopts a number of standardized patient assessment data elements. The SNF QRP applies to freestanding skilled nursing facilities, skilled nursing facilities affiliated with acute care facilities, and all non-critical access hospital swing-bed rural hospitals. 
On July 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule for the SNF QRP that adopted two new reporting measures and updated the specifications for another measure. Starting with the FY 2023 SNF QRP, SNFs are required for the first time to report the SNF 
Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) measure, which tracks the number of infections requiring hospitalization following a medical intervention, and the COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) measure, which tracks vaccination of staff in order to assess whether SNFs are taking steps to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Transfer of Healthcare (TOH) information data SNFs must report, which is included in the Patient-Post-Acute Care measurement, will be changed to exclude SNF patients discharged to their homes under the care of either a home health service or hospice. The elimination of this information will change how the TOH is used in calculating Patient-Post-Acute Care measurement, and may have an impact on our quality ratings and reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid on a prospective basis.
Beginning in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS issued a temporary suspension of SNF QRP reporting requirements effective until June 30, 2020. This effectively gave skilled nursing facilities discretion as to whether to report data from the fourth quarter (October 1, 2019 – December 31, 2019), and removed reporting requirements entirely for the first and second quarters of 2020 (January 1, 2020 – June 30, 2020). Skilled nursing facilities were required to resume timely quality data collection and submission of measure and patient assessment data effective June 30, 2020. In January 2022, SNF ratings based on the resumed data reporting were recalculated for publication on the SNF Care Compare website.
Medicare Annual Market Basket
CMS is required to calculate an annual Medicare market-basket update to the payment rates. On July 31, 2020, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2021 that updates the Medicare payment rates and the quality programs for skilled nursing facilities. Under the final rule, effective October 1, 2020, the aggregate payments to skilled nursing facilities increased by 2.2% for fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020. This estimated increase is attributable to a 2.2% market basket increase factor.
On July 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2022 that updates the Medicare payment rates and the quality programs for skilled nursing facilities. Under the final rule, effective October 1, 2021, the aggregate net market basket rate increased by 1.2% for fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. This increase is attributable to a 2.7% market basket increase factor with a 0.8% point reduction for forecast error adjustment and a 0.7% point reduction for multifactor productivity adjustment.
On April 12, 2021, CMS revealed its intent to recalibrate PDPM’s parity adjustment up to 5.0% based on the prior year aggregate spending under the new model. On July 29, 2021, CMS’s final rule for fiscal year 2022 did not include this parity adjustment and indicated that this PDPM parity adjustment would be revisited in CMS’s proposed rule for the 2023 fiscal year. The reimbursement change, if proposed and finalized in a future fiscal year, could adversely impact our reimbursement rates. 
Sequestration of Medicare Rates
The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires a mandatory, across the board reduction in federal spending, called a sequestration. Medicare FFS claims with dates of service or dates of discharge on or after April 1, 2013 incur a 2.0% reduction in Medicare payments. All Medicare rate payments and settlements have incurred this mandatory reduction and it will continue to be in place through at least 2023, unless Congress takes further action. In response to COVID-19, the CARES Act temporarily suspended the automatic 2.0% reduction of Medicare claim reimbursements for the period of May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act further suspended the 2.0% payment adjustment through March 31, 2021. On April 14, 2021, Congress extended the suspension of the 2.0% payment adjustment through December 31, 2021. On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed into law a bill to postpone the 2.0% payment adjustment through April 1, 2022; from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, the 2.0% payment adjustment is reduced from 2.0% to 1.0%. To pay for the change, Congress would increase the sequester cuts by one year to fiscal year 2030.
Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF-VBP) Program
The SNF-VBP Program rewards skilled nursing facilities with incentive payments based on the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries, as measured by a hospital readmissions measure. CMS annually adjusts its payment rules for skilled nursing facilities using the SNF-VBP Program. Effective October 1, 2018, CMS began withholding 2.0% to fund the SNF-VBP incentive payment pool and will redistribute 60% of the withheld payments back to skilled nursing facilities through the program. The fiscal year 2020 SNF PPS Rules estimate the economic impact of the SNF-VBP Program to be a reduction of $213.6 million in aggregate payments to skilled nursing facilities during fiscal year 2020. The Rule also introduced two new quality measures to assess how health information is shared and adopted a number of standardized patient assessment data elements that assess factors such as cognitive function and mental status, special services, and social determinants of health. The fiscal year 2021 SNF PPS rule updated the deadlines for baseline period quality measure quarterly reporting and announced performance periods and standards for the fiscal year 2023 program year, but otherwise made no changes to the measures, scoring or payment policies. In the fiscal year 2022 program, CMS proposed changes to account for COVID-19 impacting 
readmission rates and SNF admissions during the performance periods of fiscal year 2020. These proposed changes would impact the SNF-VBP rate adjustment. On July 29, 2021, CMS published its final rule for the fiscal year 2022 program in the Federal Register, adopting the proposed changes for measuring the performance period and amending the data to be reported to CMS, which impacted the SNF-VBP rate adjustment.
 Part B Rehabilitation Requirements
Some of our revenue is paid by the Medicare Part B program under a fee schedule. Part B services are limited with a payment cap by combined speech-language pathology services (SLP) and physical therapy (PT) services and a separate annual cap for occupational therapy (OT) services. These caps were implemented under the authority of the Balanced Budget Amendments of 1997. These amounts were previously associated with the financial limitation amounts. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) repealed those caps while retaining and adding additional limitations to ensure appropriate therapy services. This policy does not limit the amount of medically necessary Medicare Part B therapy services a beneficiary may receive. The BBA establishes coding modifier requirements to obtain payments beyond the updated KX modifier thresholds, discussed below, and reaffirms the specific $3,000 claim audit threshold requirements for the Medicare Administrative Contractors. For PT and SLP combined the threshold for coding modifier requirements is $2,110 for 2021, compared to $2,080 for 2020. The KX Modifier Threshold is set at $2,150 for CY 2022. The threshold is the same for OT services. 
Consistent with CMS’s “Patients over Paperwork” initiative, the agency has also been moving toward eliminating burdensome claims-based functional reporting requirements for Part B therapy services. For example, beginning in January 2019, skilled nursing facilities are no longer required to append selected G-codes or the severity modifiers on outpatient therapy claims. This reduces the reporting burden on therapists providing outpatient services and increases the amount of time that therapists can spend with their patients. Effective January 1, 2021, CMS rescinded 21 problematic National Correct Coding Initiative edits impacting outpatient therapy services, including services furnished under Medicare Part B primarily related to PT and OT services. These code edits were previously implemented on October 1, 2020 and required additional documentation and claim modifier coding burden when procedure codes representing many PT or OT evaluation codes or treatment codes performed under a PT, OT, or SLP plan of care was billed on the same date. This additional coding burden has been removed.
On December 1, 2020, CMS issued the calendar year 2021 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Final Rule, which reduced the conversion factor (i.e. the number by which CMS determine all current procedural terminology code payments) by 10.2%. These changes lowered the reimbursement rate for therapy Medicare Part B specialty providers, specific to our industry by 9% for PT and OT and by 6% for SLP Codes.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA, also referred to as The Omnibus Appropriations Law) was signed into law on December 27, 2020. The CAA includes three components relevant to the Medicare Part B PFS. First, the CAA incorporates a rate relief of approximately 3.75% for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, the CAA incorporates a freeze to the payment for the physician add-on code for three years which would effectively create relief on the initial cuts through 2023. Finally, the relief calls for the 2% sequester to not be applied to the Medicare Part B program for the first quarter of 2021. CMS incorporated the first and second components of the CAA relief into the fiscal year 2021 PFS files which were published on January 5, 2021. While the 2021 PFS Final Rule reduced the fiscal year 2021 factor to $32.4085 (calendar year conversion factor was $36.0896), subsequently, the CAA restored part of the reductions resulting in the final fiscal year 2021 conversion factor of $34.8931. This conversion factor rate does not include the 2% sequester which has been suspended until April 1, 2022 and then will be implemented as a 1% sequestration until June 30, 2022. 
On July 13, 2021, CMS issued the calendar year 2022 PFS proposed rule, which proposes to implement the portion of the BBA requiring the use of new modifiers to allow CMS to identify and make payments at 85% of the otherwise applicable Part B payment amount for PT and OT services furnished in whole or in part by PT and OT assistants. Other changes in the proposed rule, including reducing the conversion factor by 3.89%, will have the effect of lowering the reimbursement rate for Part B therapy services if implemented. On November 19, 2021, CMS published the 2022 PFS, which required the use of new modifiers (the CO modifier) to identify and make payments at 85% of the otherwise applicable Part B payment amount for PT and OT services furnished in whole, or in part by PT and OT assistants. On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act into law, which restored funding for Medicare payments that was removed in the 2022 PFS. Following passage of this law, CMS announced forthcoming payment changes to the 2022 PFS on December 16, 2021. Based on these announced adjustments, Medicare payments would not be adjusted from January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2022; FFS Medicare payments would then be adjusted by 1% from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and further adjusted by a total of 2% from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Under the recalculated 2022 PFS announced by CMS in December of 2021, the conversion factor was reduced from the 2021 conversion factor of $34.8931 by 0.82% to $34.6062, rather than the expected 3.89% in the proposed rule, or by the more than 3.7% expected based on the calculations contained within the original 2022 PFS announced in November of 2021, which would have reduced the conversion factor to $33.5983. 
The Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (MPPR) continues at a 50% reduction, which is applied to therapy procedures by reducing payments for practice expense of the second and subsequent procedures when services provided beyond one unit of one procedure are provided on the same day. The implementation of MPPR includes (1) facilities that provide Medicare Part B speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy services and bill under the same provider number; and (2) providers in private practice, including speech-language pathologists, who perform and bill for multiple services in a single day.
On May 27, 2020, pursuant to its authority under the Emergency Waivers, CMS added physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology to list of approved telehealth Providers for the Medicare Part B programs provided by a skilled nursing facility. This waiver allows the reimbursement of certain Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes delivered by PT, OT, SLP through telehealth through the end of the public health emergency. Subsequently, the calendar year 2021 PFS Final Rule added certain of these PT and OT services to the list of Medicare telehealth services on a temporary basis through the end of the calendar year in which the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. These services have been used to provide some services to community-based outpatients from our skilled nursing facilities that are eligible through local rules to provide community-based outpatient services. Under the calendar year 2022 PFS, these certain telehealth services would continue to be included on the Medicare telehealth services list until the end of calendar year 2023.
Pursuant to the Emergency Waivers, CMS allowed for the facility to bill an originating site fee to CMS for telehealth services provided to Medicare Part B beneficiary residents of the facility when the services are provided by a physician from an alternate location, effective March 6, 2020 through the end of the public health emergency, which is currently in effect through April 16, 2022 and could be further extended (or expired Emergency Waivers even reinstated) due to waves of COVID-19 variants that affected the country and globe in 2021 and continuing into 2022. The PFS Final Rule also increased the frequency limitation on nursing facility telehealth visits from once every 30 days to once every fourteen days. Our facilities are utilizing this waiver as physicians elect to provide telehealth visits to Medicare Part B beneficiaries residing in the skilled nursing facility.
On December 31, 2020, CMS announced the annual update to the list of codes that describe Medicare Part B outpatient therapy services, effective January 1, 2021. Several existing and new codes introduced during the COVID-19 public health emergency impacting skilled nursing facilities providers for use under physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology plans of care were recently made permanent including several telehealth codes. CMS designated all these new HCPCS/Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes as “sometimes therapy,” to permit physicians and certain non-physician practitioners, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists, to render these services outside a therapy plan of care when appropriate. “Sometimes therapy” codes will not have the MPPR applied. On November 19, 2021, CMS expanded these “sometimes therapy” codes further for the 2022 PFS, including five new codes for remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) treatment. These RTM codes affect skilled nursing facilities and be used to measure and evaluate adherence to medication and therapy, as well as response to medication and therapy. The use of RTM codes is anticipated to be broader than the existing remote patient monitoring codes approved by CMS.
Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly
CMS issued a final rule on June 3, 2019, which updates the requirements for the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The regulation is intended to provide greater operational flexibility, remove redundancies and outdated information and codify existing programs. Such flexibility includes: (i) more lenient standards applicable to the current requirement that the PACE organization be monitored for compliance with the PACE program requirements during and after a 3-year trial period and (ii) relieving certain restrictions placed upon the interdisciplinary team that comprehensively assesses and provides for the individual needs of each PACE participant by allowing one person to fill two roles and permitting secondary participation in the PACE program. Further, non-physician primary care providers can provide certain services in place of primary care physicians. On October 21, 2021, CMS published an extension of the timeline to complete further final rulemaking for the PACE program until November 1, 2022, based on a proposed rule published on November 1, 2018, regarding policy and technical changes to Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, PACE, Medicaid FFS, and Medicaid managed care programs for 2020 and 2021. Based on completed studies, public comments, and the intervening COVID-19 pandemic that required CMS’s focus, CMS extended the timeline to issue a final rule regarding new policy and technical changes to the PACE program until November of 2022. The November 2018 proposed rule suggests changes to payment and appeals of disputes within the PACE program which may affect our business.
Preadmission Screening and Resident Review
On February 20, 2020, CMS published a proposed rule which would modernize requirements for the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review process. This process assesses the needs of individuals with mental illness or intellectual 
disability that are applying to or residing in Medicaid-certified nursing facilities. The proposed rule, if enacted as currently drafted, would impose additional resident review requirements that are not reflected in current regulations, authorize the use of telehealth, and simplify the list of information that must be collected during evaluations.
Decisions Regarding Skilled Nursing Facility Payment
Medicare reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. Historically, adjustments to reimbursement under Medicare have had a significant effect on our revenue. The federal government and state governments continue to focus on efforts to curb spending on healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are not able to predict the outcome of the legislative process. We also cannot predict the extent to which proposals will be adopted or, if adopted and implemented, what effect, if any, such proposals and existing new legislation will have on us. Efforts to impose reduced allowances, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services. Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins. For a discussion of historic adjustments and recent changes to the Medicare program and related reimbursement rates, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors under the headings Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - “Our revenue could be impacted by federal and state changes to reimbursement and other aspects of Medicaid and Medicare,” “Our future revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be impacted by continued cost containment pressures on Medicaid spending,” “We may not be fully reimbursed for all services for which each facility bills through consolidated billing, which could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations” and “Reforms to the U.S. healthcare system will impose new requirements upon us and may lower our reimbursements.” 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Various healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA). The reforms contained in the ACA have affected our operating subsidiaries in some manner and are directed in large part at increased quality and cost reductions. Several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services, the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment. These reforms include modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling of payments to cover both acute and post-acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. The upcoming Congressional elections in the United States and policies implemented by the current and former Presidential administration have resulted in significant changes in legislation, regulation, implementation of Medicare, Medicaid, and government policy. The 2022 midterm elections may significantly alter the current regulatory framework and impact our business and the health care industry. We continually monitor these developments so we can respond to the changing regulatory environment impacting our business.
Requirements of Participation
CMS has requirements that providers, including skilled nursing facilities and other long-term care (LTC) facilities must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. Some requirements can be burdensome and costly, and in recent years, CMS has modified these requirements. For example, beginning in 2016, skilled nursing facilities were required to comply with emergency preparedness requirements, which requirements have since been strengthened via promulgation of additional rules. 
Another relevant change is a 2019 final rule that removed the prohibition on the use of pre-dispute, binding arbitration agreements by LTC facilities. The rule imposed specific requirements on the use of these agreements, including requiring the use of plain language in drafting; that facilities post a notice in plain language that describes the policy on the use of agreements for binding arbitration in an area that is visible to residents and visitors; that admission to the facility not be conditioned on the signing of an arbitration agreement; and that the facility expressly inform the resident or his/her representative of the right not to sign the agreement as a condition of admission. Congress has routinely introduced, but not passed, legislation addressing the issue of arbitration agreements used by LTC facilities. While legislative action is possible in the future, federal and state regulations remain our primary source of authority over the use of pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements.
As discussed under the “Coronavirus” heading above, the Administration announced that CMS and OSHA would implement emergency rules requiring all workers within all Medicare and Medicaid-participating nursing homes, and all employees of companies with more than 100 employees, to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Significant litigation 
followed, including enforcement of both the CMS and OSHA vaccination mandates being halted by certain courts. On January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court held that the OSHA vaccination mandate could not be enforced against large employers, but that the CMS vaccination mandate could be enforced upon Medicare- and Medicaid-participating facilities. Those states except Texas where the CMS rule had been halted against enforcement then had to enforce the rule. On January 20, 2022, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas dismissed the block of the CMS's vaccination IFR in Texas. That same day, CMS became empowered to enforce the IFR in Texas and set a deadline of March 21, 2022 for full compliance with its vaccination requirements.
Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws and Enforcement
Various complex federal and state laws exist which govern a wide array of referrals, relationships and arrangements, and prohibit fraud by healthcare providers. Governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud efforts. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud. Additionally, in connection with our involvement with federal healthcare reimbursement programs, the government or those acting on its behalf may bring an action under the FCA, alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government by submitting a claim for items or services not rendered as claimed, which may include coding errors, billing for services not provided, and submitting false or erroneous cost reports. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) expanded the scope of the FCA by, among other things, creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The FCA clarifies that if an item or service is provided in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the claim submitted for those items or services is a false claim that may be prosecuted under the FCA as a false claim. Civil monetary penalties under the FCA range from approximately $11 thousand to $23 thousand per violation and are adjusted annually for inflation. Under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the FCA, a private individual with knowledge of fraud may bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and receive a percentage of the federal government’s recovery. Due to these whistleblower incentives, lawsuits have become more frequent. Many states also have a false claim prohibition that mirrors or tracks the federal FCA. Federal law also provides that OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from federally funded health care programs on a number of grounds, including, but not limited to, certain types of criminal offenses, licensure revocations or suspensions, and exclusion from state or other federal healthcare programs. And, CMS can recover overpayments from health care providers up to five years following the year in which payment was made.
In November 2019, the OIG released a report of its investigation into overpayments to hospitals that did not comply with Medicare’s post-acute-care transfer policy. Hospitals violating this policy transferred patients to certain post-acute-care settings, such as skilled nursing facilities, but claimed the higher reimbursements associated with discharges to homes. A similar OIG audit report, released in February 2019, focused on improper payments for skilled nursing facility services when the Medicare three-day inpatient hospital stay requirement was not met. In 2021, the OIG released the result of an audit finding that Medicare overpaid millions of dollars of chronic care management (CCM) services. The OIG's 2021 report found that in calendar years 2017 and 2018, Medicare overpaid millions of dollars in CCM claims. These investigatory actions by OIG demonstrate its increased scrutiny into post-hospital skilled nursing facility care provided to beneficiaries and may encourage additional oversight or stricter compliance standards.
On numerous occasions, CMS has indicated its intent to vigilantly monitor overall payments to skilled nursing facilities, paying particular attention to facilities that have high reimbursements for ultra-high therapy, therapy resource utilization groups with higher activities of daily living scores, and long average lengths of stay. The OIG recognizes that there is a strong financial incentive for facilities to bill for higher levels of therapies, even when not needed by patients. We cannot predict the extent to which the OIG's recommendations to CMS will be implemented and, what effect, if any, such proposals would have on us. Our business model, like those of some other for-profit operators, is based in part on seeking out higher-acuity patients whom we believe are generally more profitable, and over time our overall patient mix has consistently shifted to higher-acuity in most facilities we operate. We also use specialized care-delivery software that assists our caregivers in more accurately capturing and recording services in order to, among other things, increase reimbursement to levels appropriate for the care actually delivered. These efforts may place us under greater scrutiny with the OIG, CMS, our fiscal intermediaries, recovery audit contractors and others. 
Federal Healthcare Reform
In 2015, CMS released a final rule addressing, among other things, implementation of certain provisions of Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which changes the way physicians are paid who participate in Medicare through implementation of the Quality Payment Program, which created new paths for payment based on the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or the use of Alternative Payment Models (APM). A measure to ascertain provider quality is the Five-Star Quality Rating system, which includes a rating of one to five in various categories. In 2018 and 2019, these calculations changed to reflect new and additional data that affected rankings, including freezing information regarding health inspection 
information, and including data to reflect the ranking of staffing (including emphasizing the level of registered nurse staffing), stay durations, spending, discharge outcomes and readmissions. 
As of January 1, 2020, CMS assigned ratings to SNFs under its Five Star Quality reporting system and displayed those ratings on its consumer-based Nursing Home Compare website. CMS’s assignment of ratings under its Five Star Quality for a SNF measure is based upon numerous quality measures, which as of January 1, 2020 included staffing levels (and staffing composition, focusing on the use of registered nurses), the use of antipsychotic medications, rate of hospitalization, emergency department use, community discharge, improvements in function, independently worsened and anxiety or hypnotic medication use, payroll based journals, and Medicare spending by beneficiary. Additionally, this data is segregated and rated separately for short-term and long-term stays in the SNF. These measures were subject to thresholds for stars assigned based on both staffing and quality components, with standards for score assignment that restricted the number of 4- and 5-star ratings that could be given. This resulted in a reduction in the number of 4- and 5-star facilities compared to their prior ranking, including certain of our own facilities. CMS also displays a consumer alert icon next to nursing homes that had been cited for incidents of abuse, neglect, or exploitation on the Nursing Home Compare website, which is updated monthly with CMS’s refresh of survey inspection results on that website. In February 2020, CMS announced that part of its Enhancing Enforcement efforts would include improved oversight of state survey agencies (SSA) and revisions to the State Performance Standards System, which is the program used to access SSA performance.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary freeze was placed on Skilled Nursing Facilities Quality Reporting Program data, Staffing data, and Health Inspection data on the Nursing Home Compare website to account for the suspended reporting and inspection obligations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The information reported to CMS and used in these quality calculations changed over the period of 2020. Beginning in August of 2020, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS announced a new, targeted inspection plan to focus on urgent patient safety threats and infection control, therefore causing a shift in the number of nursing homes inspected and the manner in which the inspections are conducted. As this change would disrupt the inspections and data collection CMS and state surveyors conducted as part of the Nursing Home Five Star Quality Rating System, results of these inspections conducted on or after March 4, 2020 were not initially used to calculate a nursing home’s health inspection star ratings. By December of 2020, CMS and state surveyors had resumed inspections of nursing homes to include inspection data, including surveys that occurred on March 4, 2020 and afterward, in its star rankings calculated for January 2021. CMS resumed calculating nursing homes' health inspection ratings on January 27, 2021. Similarly, although staff reporting requirements were waived for the first and second quarters of 2020, this waiver ended on June 25, 2020. Thereafter, nursing homes were required to report staffing data to CMS, which was incorporated into CMS’s Five Star Quality rating for those nursing homes beginning in January 2021. The January 2021 calculation of Five Star Quality ratings for nursing homes reflected nursing home-provided quarterly updates of most quality measures for the period beginning June 2019 and ending June 2020 due to interruptions in data collection. The quality measures that are specific to SNFs but not included in CMS’s Five Star Quality ratings for January 2021 were the measures for percentages of new or worsening pressure injuries, and the rate of residents who successfully return to home from a SNF. These measures may be included in future Five Star Quality ratings and the delay may not reveal improvements in previously low-rated facilities, or declines in performance within highly rated facilities. When the anticipated January 2022 refresh of Five Star Quality ratings occurs, SNF quality reporting measures will be calculated based on the data reported from July 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 PHE. When these Five Star Quality ratings are updated, they may not contain or reflect the latest or most accurate data regarding our facilities, including improvements in previously low-rated facilities, or declines in performance within higher-rated facilities.
Another impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System is CMS’s decision to make submission of the minimum data set assessment data optional for the fourth quarter of 2019 and excepted for the first and second quarters of 2020. Due to the gap in reported data, CMS did not include the two quality measures that are reflected in the minimum data set assessment-based data in its quality measure ratings in January 2021. 
On August 10, 2021, the Nursing Home Improvement and Accountability Act of 2021 (Nursing Home Improvement Act) was introduced in the U.S. Senate and is intended to update federal nursing home policy to improve quality of care and oversight. The proposed legislation reduces SNF payments by two percentage points beginning in fiscal year 2025 for inaccurate submission of certain data, provides federal funding of $50 million to carry out data validation tasks for SNF data and provides federal funding of $250 million to ensure accuracy of information on cost reports. The Nursing Home Improvement Act also proposes to establish nurse staffing requirements, including the requirement for the use of a 24-hour registered professional nurse and other provisions intended to increase transparency and accuracy of reported data regarding nursing activities, improve accountability and enhance quality of care. If passed in its current form, however, this bill would provide participating states with a temporary enhanced federal Medicaid match to fund improvements in nursing home workforce and care. This match would last six years and states would be responsible for showing CMS that Medicaid 
reimbursement increases were used to increase worker wages and yield new training resources and opportunities for nursing home staff. As of December 31, 2021, no action has been taken on this bill since its introduction to the Senate on August 10, 2021 and referral to the Senate Finance Committee that same day. 
Monitoring Compliance in Our Facilities
Governmental agencies and other authorities periodically inspect our independent operating facilities to assess compliance with various standards, rules and regulations. The robust regulatory and enforcement environment continues to impact healthcare providers, especially in connection with responses to any alleged noncompliance identified in periodic surveys and other inspections by governmental authorities. Unannounced surveys or inspections generally occur at least annually and may also follow a government agency's receipt of a complaint about a facility. Facilities must pass these inspections to maintain licensure under state law, to obtain or maintain certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to continue participation in the Veterans Administration program at some facilities, and to comply with provider contracts with managed care clients at many facilities. From time to time, our independent operating subsidiaries, like others in the healthcare industry, may receive notices from federal and state regulatory agencies of an alleged failure to substantially comply with applicable standards, rules or regulations. These notices may require corrective action, may impose civil monetary penalties for noncompliance, and may threaten or impose other operating restrictions on skilled nursing facilities such as admission holds, provisional skilled nursing license, or increased staffing requirements. If our independent operating subsidiaries fail to comply with these directives or otherwise fail to comply substantially with licensure and certification laws, rules and regulations, the facility could lose its certification as a Medicare or Medicaid provider, or lose its license permitting operation in the State. 
Facilities with otherwise acceptable regulatory histories generally are normally given an opportunity to correct deficiencies and continue their participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs by a certain date, usually within nine months; however, although where denial of payment remedies are asserted, such interim remedies go into effect much sooner. Facilities with deficiencies that immediately jeopardize patient health and safety and those that are classified as poor performing facilities, however, may not be given an opportunity to correct their deficiencies prior to the imposition of remedies and other enforcement actions. Moreover, facilities with poor regulatory histories continue to be classified by CMS as poor performing facilities notwithstanding any intervening change in ownership, unless the new owner obtains a new Medicare provider agreement instead of assuming the facility's existing agreement. However, new owners nearly always assume the existing Medicare provider agreement due to the difficulty and time delays generally associated with obtaining new Medicare certifications, especially in previously certified locations with sub-par operating histories. Accordingly, facilities that have poor regulatory histories before acquisition by our independent operating subsidiaries and that develop new deficiencies after acquisition are more likely to have sanctions imposed upon them by CMS or state regulators. 
In addition, CMS has increased its focus on facilities with a history of serious or sustained quality of care problems through the special focus facility (SFF) initiative. A facility's administrators and owners are notified when it is identified as a special focus facility. This information is also provided to the general public. The SFF designation is based in part on the facility's compliance history typically dating before our acquisition of the facility. Local state survey agencies recommend to CMS that facilities be placed on special focus status. SFFs receive heightened scrutiny and more frequent regulatory surveys. Failure to improve the quality of care can result in fines and termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. A facility “graduates” from the program once it demonstrates significant improvements in quality of care that are continued over a defined period of time. 
Sanctions such as denial of payment for new admissions often are scheduled to go into effect before surveyors return to verify compliance. Generally, if the surveyors confirm that the facility is in compliance upon their return, the sanctions never take effect. However, if they determine that the facility is not in compliance, the denial of payment goes into effect retroactive to the date given in the original notice. This possibility sometimes leaves affected operators, including our independent subsidiaries, with the difficult task of deciding whether to continue accepting patients after the potential denial of payment date, thus risking the retroactive denial of revenue associated with those patients' care if the operators are later found to be out of compliance, or simply refusing admissions from the potential denial of payment date until the facility is actually found to be in compliance. In the past and from time to time, some of our independent operating subsidiaries have been or will be in denial of payment status due to findings of continued regulatory deficiencies, resulting in an actual loss of the revenue associated with the Medicare and Medicaid patients admitted after the denial of payment date. Additional sanctions could ensue and, if imposed, could include various remedies up to and including decertification.
CMS has undertaken several initiatives to increase or intensify Medicaid and Medicare survey and enforcement activities, including federal oversight of state actions. CMS is taking steps to focus more survey and enforcement efforts on facilities with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicaid and Medicare standards, and to identify multi-facility providers with patterns of noncompliance. In addition, HHS has adopted a rule that requires CMS to charge user fees to healthcare 
facilities cited during regular certification, recertification or substantiated complaint surveys for deficiencies, which require a revisit to assure that corrections have been made. CMS is also increasing its oversight of state survey agencies and requiring state agencies to use enforcement sanctions and remedies more promptly when substandard care or repeat violations are identified, to investigate complaints more promptly, and to survey facilities more consistently.
Regulations Regarding Financial Arrangements
We are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangement by and between healthcare providers, such as the federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark laws, and various state anti-referral laws. 
The Anti-Kickback Statute, Section 1128B of the Social Security Act (Anti-Kickback Statute) prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce the referral of an individual, in return for recommending, or to arrange for, the referral of an individual for any item or service payable under any federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The OIG has issued regulations that create “safe harbors” for certain conduct and business relationships that are deemed protected under the Anti-Kickback Statute. In order to receive safe harbor protection, all of the requirements of a safe harbor must be met. The fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbors, however, does not render the arrangement per se illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria, if investigated, will be evaluated based upon all facts and circumstances and risk increased scrutiny and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities. 
Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal penalties of up to $100 thousand and ten years imprisonment. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in civil monetary penalties of up to $100 thousand per violation and an assessment of up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may also result in an individual's or organization's exclusion from future participation in federal healthcare programs. State Medicaid programs are required to enact an anti-kickback statute. Many states in which our independent operating subsidiaries operate have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients regardless of the source of payment for the care. We believe that business practices of providers and financial relationships between providers have become subject to increased scrutiny as healthcare reform efforts continue on the federal and state levels. 
Additionally, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” provides that a physician may not refer a Medicare or Medicaid patient for a “designated health service” to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship unless the financial arrangement meets an exception under the Stark Law or its regulations. Designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, PT, OT, SLP, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies, diagnostic imaging, enteral and parenteral feeding and supplies and home health services. Under the Stark Law, a “financial relationship” is defined as an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement. If such a financial relationship exists and does not meet a Stark Law exception, the entity is prohibited from submitting or claiming payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from collecting from the patient or other payor. Many of the compensation arrangements exceptions permit referrals if, among other things, the arrangement is set forth in a written agreement signed by the parties, the compensation to be paid is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties. Exceptions may have other requirements. Any funds collected for an item or service resulting from a referral that violates the Stark Law are not eligible for payment by federal healthcare programs and must be repaid to Medicare or Medicaid, any other third-party payor, and the patient. Violations of the Stark Law may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties, including, treble damages. Individuals and organizations may also be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs for Stark Law violations. Many states have enacted healthcare provider referral laws that go beyond physician self-referrals or apply to a greater range of services than just the designated health services under the Stark Law. 
Regulations Regarding Patient Record Confidentiality
Health care providers are also subject to laws and regulations enacted to protect the confidentiality of patient health information. For example, HHS has issued rules pursuant to HIPAA, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act which governs our use and disclosure of protected health information of patients. We have established policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements at our independent operating subsidiaries. Our independent operating subsidiaries have adopted and implemented HIPAA compliance plans, which we believe comply with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our independent operating subsidiaries in order to comply with these standards. There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our independent operating subsidiaries are also subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties for 
privacy and security breaches. Healthcare entities are also required to afford patients with certain rights of access to their health information under HIPAA and the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act). Recently, the Office of Civil Rights, the agency responsible for HIPAA enforcement, has targeted investigative and enforcement efforts on violations of patients’ rights of access, including denial of access to medical records, imposing significant fines for violations largely initiated from patient complaints. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology can also investigate and impose separate penalties for information blocking violations under the Cures Act.
Antitrust Laws
We are also subject to federal and state antitrust laws. Enforcement of the antitrust laws against healthcare providers is common, and antitrust liability may arise in a wide variety of circumstances, including third party contracting, physician relations, joint venture, merger, affiliation and acquisition activities. In some respects, the application of federal and state antitrust laws to healthcare is still evolving, and enforcement activity by federal and state agencies appears to be increasing. At various times, healthcare providers and insurance and managed care organizations may be subject to an investigation by a governmental agency charged with the enforcement of antitrust laws, or may be subject to administrative or judicial action by a federal or state agency or a private party. Violators of the antitrust laws could be subject to criminal and civil enforcement by federal and state agencies, as well as by private litigants.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our independent operating subsidiaries must also comply with the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that the facilities are "public accommodations" as defined in those laws. The obligation to comply with the ADA and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and the independent operating subsidiaries continue to assess their facilities relative to ADA compliance and make appropriate modifications as needed.
REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES 
As previously mentioned, senior living services revenue is primarily derived from private pay residents, with a small portion of senior living revenue (approximately 1.8% of total revenue) derived from Medicaid funds. Thus, some of the regulations discussed above applicable to Medicaid providers, also apply to senior living. However, the following provides a brief overview of the regulatory framework applicable specifically to senior living. 
A majority of states provide, or are approved to provide, Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed senior living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by CMS. State Medicaid programs control costs for senior living and other home and community-based services by various means such as restrictive financial and functional eligibility standards, enrollment limits and waiting lists. Because rates paid to senior living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to skilled nursing facility operators, some states use Medicaid funding of senior living services as a means of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of health services provided in skilled nursing facilities. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in senior living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities. As a result of the growth of senior living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. Most state licensing standards apply to senior living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding.
Since 2003, CMS has commenced a series of actions to increase its oversight of state quality assurance programs for senior living communities, and has provided guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid through Medicaid waiver programs. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community-based services as alternatives to facility-based services, pursuant to provisions of the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs.
The types of laws and statutes affecting the regulatory landscape of the post-acute industry continue to expand. In addition to this changing regulatory environment, federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on the enforcement of these laws. In order to operate our businesses, we must comply with federal, state and local laws relating to licensure, delivery and adequacy of medical care, distribution of pharmaceuticals, equipment, personnel, operating policies, fire prevention, rate-setting, billing and reimbursement, building codes and environmental protection. Additionally, we must also adhere to anti-kickback statues, physician referral laws, the ADA, and safety and health standards set by the OSHA Administration. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have an adverse impact on our methods and costs of doing business.
Our independent operating subsidiaries are also subject to various regulations and licensing requirements promulgated by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Requirements vary from state to state and these requirements can affect, among other things, personnel education and training, patient and personnel records, services, staffing levels, monitoring of patient wellness, patient furnishings, housekeeping services, dietary requirements, emergency plans and procedures, certification and licensing of staff prior to beginning employment, and patient rights. These laws and regulations could limit our ability to expand into new markets and to expand the services provided by independent operating subsidiaries in existing markets.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 We strive to reduce our environmental impact through initiatives to modernize our facilities, conserve water, optimize waste, work towards a paperless office and partner with green vendors. Our ongoing and planned facility modernization initiatives include solar projects, heating, ventilation and air condition (HVAC) upgrades, water systems updates, lighting retrofits and utility upgrades. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we spent $69.6 million on purchases of property and equipment which included facility modernization initiatives. 
Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. As a healthcare provider, we face regulatory requirements in areas of air and water quality control, medical and low-level radioactive waste management and disposal, asbestos management, response to mold and lead-based paint in our facilities and employee safety.
 As an owner or operator of our facilities, we also may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances that are located on and/or under the property, including any such substances that may have migrated off, or may have been discharged or transported from the property. Part of our operations involves the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and discharge of medical, biological, infectious, toxic, flammable and other hazardous materials, wastes, pollutants or contaminants. In addition, we are sometimes unable to determine with certainty whether prior uses of our facilities and properties or surrounding properties may have produced continuing environmental contamination or noncompliance, particularly where the timing or cost of making such determinations is not deemed cost-effective. These activities, as well as the possible presence of such materials in, on and under our properties, may result in damage to individuals, property or the environment; may interrupt operations or increase costs; may result in legal liability, damages, injunctions or fines; may result in investigations, administrative proceedings, penalties or other governmental agency actions; and may not be covered by insurance.
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements. However, we cannot assure you that we will not encounter liabilities with respect to these regulations in the future, and such liabilities may result in material adverse consequences to our operations or financial condition.
