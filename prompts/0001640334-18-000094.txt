Item 1. Business
 
Our initial business plan was to build a family waterpark in a state-of-the-art designed aquatic center in several locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands. We were not able to develop this business and we did not generate any revenues in this business.
 
On January 30, 2017, our then principal stockholder sold his stock in our company, which represented more than 76% of our outstanding stock to our current chief executive officer, who acquired 63.6% of our outstanding stock, and two other individuals. Following the change of control on January 30, 2017, we discontinued our efforts to develop aquatic centers, and we are seeking to engage in the business of developing and marketing nutritional products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle. In this connection we intend to conduct research and development on our own proprietary products based on cordyceps sinensis. Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. According to the Journal of Ayuveda and Integrative Medicine, the fungus is parasitic in nature. The base of the mushroom first originates from an insect larval host and ends at the club-like cap, including the stipe and stroma. The fruit body is dark brown to black, and the root of organism, the larval body pervaded by the mycelium, is yellowish to brown color. The immature larvae (host) on which cordyceps grows usually lies about 6 inches below the surface of the ground. As the fungus approaches maturity, it consumes more than 90% of the infected insect effectively mummifying its host. Local folk practitioners use the product alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs to treat various diseases. However, the effectiveness of Cordyceps sinensis, either alone or with other medicinal herbs, has not been shown as effective in double blind tests, and it has not been subject to the type of testing that would be required for prescription medication. As a result, in the United States we cannot make any claims as to specific health benefits.
 
We plan to conduct research and development with respect to our own proprietary products. However, to date we have not commenced research and development operations, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop proprietary products. 
 
As of September 30, 2017, our only revenue resulted from the sale in September 2017 of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder to a Chinese company, Xiamen Jinxia Yongfeng Commercial Co., Ltd. for a purchase price of $510,000. Our sole supplier of both the Cordycepin and cordyceps powder was Aublog Inc., a Taiwan-based supplier.
 
Our Organization
 
We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on September 24, 2014 under the name Killer Waves Hawaii, Inc. On January 30, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Acro Biomedical Co., Ltd. Our address is 2175 Visionary Way, Suite 1160, Fishers, Indiana 46038, telephone (317) 286-6788. We do not have a corporate website.
Source of Supply
 
During the year ended September 30, 2017, we had one supplier, Aublog Inc., a Taiwan-based company. We do not have any long-term supply contracts. We do not plan to establish manufacturing facilities. We have engaged in initial discussions with potential contract manufacturers. If we can negotiate acceptable terms for a contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, we would source the raw materials and have the raw materials shipped to the manufacturer who would them customize the product to meet our specifications. However, the product may bear the brand names of the manufacturer rather than our brand name. If we are not able to negotiate an agreement with a contract manufacturer, we may also buy finished products from a manufacturer, which we anticipate would have the manufacturer’s brand names. Even if we engage a contract manufacturer, we may still buy a manufacturer’s brand products either from our contract manufacturer or another supplier. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary relationships with suppliers or contract manufacturers on reasonable terms.

Government Regulations
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a dietary ingredient as a vitamin; mineral; herb or other botanical; amino acid; dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases, which means that supplements cannot make claims as to health benefits. Claims like these can only legitimately be made for drugs, not dietary supplements. Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Dietary supplements are marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, powders, and liquids. Cordyceps is considered a dietary supplement.
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. That means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and FDA regulations. The FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market.
 
The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. However, the reporting of an event is not an admission that the product caused the adverse event.
 
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to health, safety, bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and environmental. These regulations may require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will able to be in compliance.
 
Other countries also have regulations relating to the marketing, labeling and claims for dietary supplements, and, to the extent that we market our products in those countries, we must comply with all applicable regulations.
 
Research and Development
 
We intend to conduct research and development activities starting in 2018 relating to cordyceps products to be sold in the United States. We may engage third parties to perform the research and development, and the third parties may be related to our chief executive officer.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not have any patent or other intellectual property rights with respect to any products.
 
Competition
 
A number of companies market and sell cordyceps products in the United States, including Real Mushrooms, Bulk Supplements, Terrasoul SuperFoods; Mental Refreshment Nutrition, NOW Foods, Aloha Medicinals, Natures Elements and Swanson Premium. These products include cordyceps extract as well as products that include cordyceps along with other ingredients. Many, if not all, of these companies are better known and better capitalized than we are, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing suppliers of cordyceps.
Employees
 
We have one employee, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who works for us on a part-time basis.
