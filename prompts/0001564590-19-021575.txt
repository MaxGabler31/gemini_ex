ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 Toyota Motor Credit Corporation was incorporated in California in 1982 and commenced operations in 1983.  References herein to “TMCC” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, and references herein to “we”, “our”, and “us” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We are wholly-owned by Toyota Financial Services International Corporation (“TFSIC”), a California corporation, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services Corporation (“TFSC”), a Japanese corporation.  TFSC, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (“TMC”), a Japanese corporation.  TFSC manages TMC’s worldwide financial services operations.  TMCC is marketed under the brands of Toyota Financial Services and Lexus Financial Services.
 We provide a variety of finance and insurance products to authorized Toyota and Lexus dealers or dealer groups and, to a lesser extent, other domestic and import franchise dealers (collectively referred to as “dealers”) and their customers in the United States of America (excluding Hawaii) (the “U.S.”) and Puerto Rico.  Our products fall primarily into the following categories:
  
• | Finance - We acquire retail installment sales contracts from dealers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (“retail contracts”) and leasing contracts accounted for as operating leases (“lease contracts”) from dealers in the U.S. We collectively refer to our retail and lease contracts as the “consumer portfolio.” We also provide dealer financing, including wholesale financing, working capital loans, revolving lines of credit and real estate financing to dealers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We collectively refer to our dealer financing portfolio as the “dealer portfolio.” 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Insurance - Through Toyota Motor Insurance Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, and its insurance company subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “TMIS”), we provide marketing, underwriting, and claims administration for vehicle and payment protection products sold by dealers in the U.S. Our vehicle and payment protection products include vehicle service agreements, guaranteed auto protection agreements, prepaid maintenance contracts, excess wear and use agreements, tire and wheel protection agreements and key replacement protection. TMIS also provides coverage and related administrative services to certain of our affiliates in the U.S. Although the vehicle and payment protection products are generally not regulated as insurance products, for ease of reference we collectively refer to the group of products provided by TMIS herein as “insurance products.” 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We support growth in earning assets through funding obtained primarily in the global capital markets as well as funds provided by investing and operating activities.  Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of our funding activities.
 We currently acquire retail and lease contracts from dealers, and TMIS markets insurance products to dealers through 29 dealer sales and services offices (“DSSOs”).  The DSSOs are supported by three regional management offices.  The DSSOs primarily support the dealers by acquiring retail and lease contracts and providing wholesale financing and other dealer financing activities such as business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements.  The DSSOs also provide support for our insurance products sold in the U.S.  We collectively refer to the above offices as our “field operations.”  
 On April 16, 2019, we announced that we will restructure our field operations to better serve our dealer partners by streamlining our field office structure and investing in new technology.  Over the next two years, we will consolidate the field operations locations into three new regional dealer service centers located in Chandler, Arizona (serving the West region), Plano, Texas (serving the Central region) and Atlanta, Georgia (serving the East region).  The dealer lending function will be centralized at the new dealer service center located in Plano, Texas.
 We service contracts through three regional customer service centers (“CSCs”) located throughout the U.S.  The CSCs support customer account servicing functions such as collections, lease terminations, and administration of both retail and lease contract customer accounts.  The Central region CSC also supports insurance product operations by providing agreement and claims administrative services.

 Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information using the investor relations section of our website.  We use our website, press releases, as well as social media to communicate with our investors, customers and the general public about our company, our services and other issues.  While not all of the information that we post on our website or on social media is of a material nature, some information could be material.  Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the investor relations section of our website and our Twitter feed (http://www.twitter.com/toyotafinancial).  We are not incorporating any of the information set forth on our website or on social media channels into this filing on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
 Revenues generated by our retail and lease contracts are generally not subject to seasonal variations.  Financing volume is subject to a certain degree of seasonality.  This seasonality does not have a significant impact on revenues as collections, generally in the form of fixed payments, occur over the course of several years.  We are subject to seasonal variations in credit losses, which are historically higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year.

Retail and Lease Financing
 Pricing
 We utilize a tiered pricing program, which matches interest rates with customer risk as defined by credit bureau scores and other factors for a range of price and risk combinations.  Each application is assigned a credit tier. Rates vary based on credit tier, term, loan-to-value and collateral, including whether a new or used vehicle is financed. In addition, special rates may apply as a result of promotional activities.  We review and adjust interest rates based on competitive and economic factors and distribute the rates, by tier, to dealers.
Underwriting
 Dealers transmit customer credit applications electronically through our online system for contract acquisition.  The customer may submit a credit application directly to our website, in which case, the credit application is sent to the dealer of the customer’s choice and is considered by us for preapproval.  Upon receipt of the credit application, our loan origination system automatically requests a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus.  We use a proprietary credit scoring system to evaluate an applicant’s risk profile.  Factors used by the credit scoring system (based on the applicant’s credit history) include the term of the contract, ability to pay, debt ratios, amount financed relative to the value of the vehicle to be financed, and credit bureau attributes such as number of trade lines, utilization ratio and number of credit inquiries.
 Credit applications are subject to systematic evaluation.  Our loan origination system evaluates each application to determine if it qualifies for automatic approval or decline without manual intervention (“auto-decisioning”) using specific requirements, including internal credit score and other application characteristics.  Typically, the highest quality credit applications are approved automatically, and the lowest quality credit applications are automatically declined.
 Credit analysts (working in our field operations) approve or decline all credit applications that are not auto-decisioned and may also approve an application that has been the subject of an automated decline.  Failure to be automatically approved through auto-decisioning does not mean that an application does not meet our underwriting guidelines.  A credit analyst decisions applications based on an evaluation that considers an applicant’s creditworthiness and projected ability to meet the monthly payment obligation, which is derived, among other things, from the amount financed and the term.  A credit analyst will verify information contained in the credit application if the application presents an elevated level of credit risk.  Our proprietary scoring system assists the credit analyst in the credit review process.  The credit analyst’s final credit decision is made based upon the degree of credit risk perceived by the credit analyst after assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the application.
 Completion of the financing process is dependent upon whether the transaction is a retail or lease contract.  For a retail contract, we acquire the retail contract from the dealer and obtain a security interest in the vehicle.  We perfect our security interests in the financed retail vehicles through the applicable state department of motor vehicles (or equivalent) with certificate of title filings or with Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) filings, as appropriate.  For a lease contract, except as described below under “Servicing”, we acquire the lease contract and concurrently assume ownership of the leased vehicle.  We have the right to pursue collection actions against a delinquent customer, as well as repossess a vehicle if a customer fails to meet contractual obligations.  
 We regularly review and analyze our consumer portfolio to evaluate the effectiveness of our underwriting guidelines and purchasing criteria.  If external economic factors, credit losses or delinquency experience, market conditions or other factors change, we may adjust our underwriting guidelines and purchasing criteria in order to change the asset quality of our portfolio or to achieve other goals and objectives.

Subvention and Incentive Programs
 Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (“TMS”), a subsidiary of Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (“TMNA”), is the primary distributor of Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the United States.  In partnership with TMNA and certain non-affiliated third party distributors, we may offer special promotional rates, which we refer to as subvention programs.  TMNA pays us the majority of the difference between our standard rate and the promotional rate.  Amounts received in connection with these programs allow us to maintain yields at levels consistent with standard program levels.  The level of subvention program activity varies based on the marketing strategies of TMNA, economic conditions, and volume of new and used vehicle sales.  The amount of subvention received varies based on the mix of Toyota and Lexus vehicles included in the promotional rate programs and the timing of the programs.  The majority of our retail and lease contracts are subvened.  We may also offer cash and contractual residual value support incentive programs in partnership with TMNA.  Subvention and other cash incentive program payments are settled at the beginning of the retail or lease contract.  We defer the payments and recognize them over the life of the contract as a yield adjustment for retail contracts and as rental income or a reduction to depreciation expense for lease contracts.  
Servicing
 Our CSCs are responsible for servicing the consumer portfolio.  A centralized department manages third party vendor relationships responsible for bankruptcy administration, liquidation and post charge-off recovery activities, certain administrative activities, customer services activities and pre-charge-off collections with support from the CSCs. 
 We use an online collection and auto dialer system that prioritizes collection efforts and signals our collections personnel to make telephone contact with delinquent customers.  We also use a behavioral-based collection strategy to minimize risk of loss and employ various collection methods based on behavioral scoring models (which analyze borrowers’ payment performance, vehicle valuation and credit bureau scores to predict future payment behavior).  We generally determine whether to commence repossession efforts after an account is approximately 80 days past due.  Repossessed vehicles are held for sale to comply with statutory requirements and then sold at private auctions, unless public auctions are required by state law. Any unpaid amounts remaining after the repossessed vehicle is sold or after taking the full balance charge-off are pursued by us to the extent practical and legally permissible.  Any surplus amounts remaining after recovery fees, disposition costs, and other expenses have been paid, and after any reserve charge-backs, dealer guarantees and optional product refunds have been credited to the customer’s account, are refunded to the customers.  Collections of post-sale deficiencies and full-balance charge-offs are handled by third party vendors and the CSCs. We charge-off accounts when they are uncollectible or when the account balance becomes 120 days contractually delinquent, whichever occurs first.  However, the CSCs will continue to collect or pursue recovery of the vehicle up to 190 days after the account is past due.
 We may, in accordance with our customary servicing procedures, offer rebates or waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge, or any other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing the consumer portfolio.  In addition, we may defer a customer’s obligation to make a payment by extending the contract term.
 Substantially all of our retail and lease contracts are purchased as non-recourse from the dealers.  This relieves the dealers of financial responsibility in the event of a customer default.
 We may experience a higher risk of loss if customers fail to maintain required insurance coverage.  The terms of our retail contracts require customers to maintain physical damage insurance covering loss or damage to the financed vehicle in an amount not less than the full value of the vehicle and to provide evidence of such insurance upon our request.  The terms of each contract allow but do not require us to obtain any such insurance coverage on behalf of the customer.  In accordance with our customary servicing procedures, we do not exercise our right to obtain insurance coverage on behalf of the customer.  Our lease contracts require lessees to maintain minimum liability insurance and physical damage insurance covering loss or damage to the leased vehicle in an amount not less than the full value of the vehicle.  We currently do not monitor ongoing customer insurance coverage as part of our customary servicing procedures for the consumer portfolio.
 Toyota Lease Trust, a Delaware business trust (the “Titling Trust”), acts as lessor and holds title to leased vehicles in the U.S.  This arrangement was established to facilitate lease securitizations.  TMCC services lease contracts acquired by the Titling Trust from Toyota and Lexus dealers.  TMCC holds an undivided trust interest in lease contracts owned by the Titling Trust, and these lease contracts are included in Investments in operating leases, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Remarketing
 The lessee may purchase the leased vehicle at the contractual residual value or return the leased vehicle to the dealer.  If the leased vehicle is returned to the dealer, the dealer may purchase the leased vehicle or return it to us.  We are responsible for disposing of the leased vehicle if the lessee or dealer does not purchase the vehicle at lease maturity.
 In order to minimize losses when vehicles are returned to us, we have developed remarketing strategies to maximize proceeds and minimize disposition costs on used vehicles.  We use various channels to sell vehicles returned at lease-end or repossessed prior to lease-end, including a dealer direct program (“Dealer Direct”) and physical auctions.
 The goal of Dealer Direct is to increase dealer purchases of off-lease vehicles thereby reducing the disposition costs of such vehicles.  Through Dealer Direct, the dealer accepting return of the lease vehicle (the “grounding dealer”) has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual residual value, purchase the vehicle at an assessed market value, or return the vehicle to us.  Vehicles not purchased by the grounding dealer are made available to all Toyota and Lexus dealers through the Dealer Direct online auction.  Vehicles not purchased through Dealer Direct are sold at physical vehicle auction sites throughout the country.  Where deemed necessary, we recondition used vehicles prior to sale in order to enhance the vehicle values at auction.  Additionally, we redistribute vehicles geographically to minimize oversupply in any location.
 Dealer Financing
 Dealer financing is comprised of wholesale financing and other financing options designed to meet dealer business needs.
 Wholesale Financing
 We provide wholesale financing to dealers for inventories of new and used Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import vehicles.  We acquire a security interest in the vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, which we perfect through UCC filings. Wholesale financing may also be backed by corporate or individual guarantees from, or on behalf of, affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  In the event of a dealer default under a wholesale loan agreement, we have the right to liquidate assets in which we have a perfected security interest and to seek legal remedies pursuant to the wholesale loan agreement and any applicable guarantees.
 TMCC and TMNA are parties to an agreement pursuant to which TMNA will arrange for the repurchase of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles at the aggregate cost financed by TMCC in the event of a dealer default under wholesale financing.  In addition, we provide other types of wholesale financing to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties, at the request of TMNA or private Toyota distributors, and TMNA or the applicable private distributor guarantees the payments by such borrowers.
 Other Dealer Financing
 We provide fixed and variable rate working capital loans, revolving lines of credit, and real estate financing to dealers and various multi-franchise organizations referred to as dealer groups for facilities construction and refurbishment, working capital requirements, real estate purchases, business acquisitions and other general business purposes.  These loans are typically secured with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, and may be guaranteed by individual or corporate guarantees of affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements.  Our pricing reflects market conditions, the competitive environment, the level of support dealers provide our retail, lease and insurance products and the creditworthiness of each dealer.  
 Before establishing a wholesale loan or other dealer financing agreement, we perform a credit analysis of the dealer. During this analysis, we:
  
• | Review financial statements and we may obtain credit reports and bank references;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the dealer’s financial condition and history of servicing debt; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assess the dealer’s operations and management.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 On the basis of this analysis, we may approve the issuance of a loan or financing agreement and determine the appropriate amount to lend.

As part of our monitoring processes, we may require dealers to submit periodic financial statements.  We also perform periodic physical audits of vehicle inventory as well as monitor the timeliness of dealer inventory financing payoffs in accordance with the agreed-upon terms to identify possible risks.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS
 TMIS offers vehicle and payment protection products on Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import vehicles that are sold by dealers as part of the dealer’s sale of a vehicle as further described below.  Vehicle service agreements offer vehicle owners and lessees mechanical breakdown protection for new and used vehicles secondary to the manufacturer’s new vehicle warranty.  Guaranteed auto protection and debt cancellation agreements provide coverage for a lease or retail contract deficiency balance in the event of a total loss or theft of the covered vehicle.  Prepaid maintenance contracts provide maintenance services at manufacturer recommended intervals.  Excess wear and use agreements are available on leases of Toyota and Lexus vehicles and protect against excess wear and use charges that may be assessed at lease termination. Tire and wheel protection agreements provide coverage in the event that a covered vehicle’s tires or wheels become damaged as a result of a road hazard or structural failure due to a defect in material or workmanship, to the extent not covered by the manufacturer or the tire distributor warranties.  Certain tire and wheel protection agreements also cover expenses related either to replacing or reprogramming a vehicle key or vehicle key remote in the event of loss or damage.  Key replacement protection provides stand-alone coverage for expenses related either to replacing or reprogramming a vehicle key or vehicle key remote in the event of loss or damage.
 TMIS provides TMNA contractual indemnity insurance coverage for limited warranties on certified Toyota and Lexus pre-owned vehicles.  TMIS also provides umbrella liability insurance to TMNA and other affiliates covering certain dollar value layers of risk above various primary or self-insured retentions.  On all layers in which TMIS provides coverage, 99 percent of the risk is ceded to various reinsurers.  
 Effective September 2018, TMIS discontinued the wholesale inventory insurance program for which certain Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import dealers obtained coverage for eligible vehicle inventory.  The discontinuation of the wholesale inventory program did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition for our insurance operations.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
 TMCC is party to agreements with TMNA and certain TMNA subsidiaries.  For ease of reference herein, we refer solely to the parent entity, TMNA.  As a result, all references to the agreements or activities of TMNA herein that are carried out by a TMNA subsidiary are deemed to also make reference to and include the applicable TMNA subsidiary.
 TMNA sponsors subvention, cash and contractual residual value support incentive programs on certain new and used Toyota and Lexus vehicles.  The level of incentive program activity varies based on TMNA marketing strategies, economic conditions, and volume of vehicle sales.
TMCC and TMNA are parties to an agreement pursuant to which TMNA will arrange for the repurchase of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles at the aggregate cost financed by TMCC in the event of a dealer default under wholesale financing.  In addition, we provide other types of financing to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties, at the request of TMNA or private Toyota distributors, and TMNA or the applicable private distributor guarantees the payments by such borrowers.
 TMNA provides shared services to TMCC, including certain technological and administrative services, such as information systems support, facilities, insurance coverage, human resources and other corporate services.  TMCC also provides shared services to TMNA, including certain treasury and vendor management services.  
 Prior to January 1, 2015, our employees were generally eligible to participate in the Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Pension Plan (the “Pension Plan”).  Effective January 1, 2015, the Pension Plan was closed to employees first employed or reemployed on or after such date.  Employees meeting certain eligibility requirements may participate in the Toyota Motor North America, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”).  Certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2015, may be eligible to receive an additional contribution to the Savings Plan calculated based on their age and compensation. Various health, life and other post-retirement benefits are offered and sponsored by TMNA, as discussed further in Note 9 – Pension and Other Benefit Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 TMCC is party to agreements with TMNA and other affiliates relating to the team member vehicle benefit program, which allows team members to lease Toyota and Lexus vehicles on terms exclusive to the benefit program. TMNA serves as the chief administrator of the program.  TMCC acquires and services team member leases entered into after the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  A portion of the vehicles used for the team member vehicle benefit program are acquired from TMNA.  TMCC receives a per vehicle contribution from participating affiliates to assist with the costs of its contribution to the benefit program, and TMCC pays a per vehicle participation fee to TMNA to participate in the benefit program.
 TMCC and Toyota Financial Savings Bank (“TFSB”), a Nevada thrift company owned by TFSIC, are parties to a master shared services agreement under which TMCC and TFSB provide certain services to each other.  TMCC and TFSB are also parties to an expense reimbursement agreement, which provides that TMCC will reimburse certain expenses incurred by TFSB in connection with providing certain financial products and services to TMCC’s customers and dealers in support of TMCC’s customer loyalty strategy and programs.
 TMCC is party to a revolving credit facility with TMS expiring in fiscal 2022.  This credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes and was not drawn upon as of March 31, 2019. This agreement is further discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 Credit support agreements exist between TMCC and TFSC and between TFSC and TMC.  These agreements are further discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 TMIS provides administrative services and various types of coverage to TMNA and other affiliates, including contractual indemnity coverage for limited warranties on TMNA’s certified pre-owned vehicle program and umbrella liability insurance.  
 Refer to Note 12 – Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

COMPETITION
 We operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with other financial institutions including national and regional commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, online banks, and finance companies.  To a lesser extent, we compete with other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies that actively seek to purchase retail contracts through Toyota and Lexus dealers. We also compete with national and regional commercial banks and other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies for dealer financing.  No single competitor is dominant in the industry.  We compete primarily through service quality, our relationship with TMNA, and financing rates.  We seek to provide exceptional customer service and competitive financing programs to our dealers and to their customers.  Our affiliation with TMNA offers an advantage in providing financing or leasing of Toyota and Lexus vehicles.
 Competition for the insurance products is primarily from national and regional independent service contract providers.  We compete primarily through service quality, our relationship with TMNA and product benefits.  Our affiliation with TMNA provides an advantage in selling our insurance products and services.
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 Our finance and insurance products are regulated under both federal and state law. 
 Federal Consumer Finance Regulation
 Our finance operations are governed by, among other federal laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the unfair, deceptive and abusive practices (UDAAP) provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), and the consumer data privacy and security provisions of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act.  
 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act is designed to prevent credit discrimination on the basis of certain protected classes, requires the distribution of specified credit decision notices and limits the information that may be requested and considered in a credit transaction.  The Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act place disclosure and substantive transaction restrictions on consumer credit and leasing transactions.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes restrictions and requirements regarding our use and sharing of credit reports, the reporting of data to credit reporting agencies including the accuracy and integrity of information reported, credit decision notices, consumer dispute handling procedures and identity theft prevention requirements.  The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides additional protections for certain customers in the military. For example, it requires us, in most circumstances, to reduce the interest rate charged to customers who have subsequently joined, enlisted, been inducted or called to active military duty, and also requires us to allow eligible servicemembers to terminate their lease agreements with us early without penalty.  UDAAP laws prohibit practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive towards consumers.  
 Federal privacy and data security laws place restrictions on our use and sharing of consumer data, impose privacy notice requirements, give consumers the right to opt out of certain uses and sharing of their data and impose safeguarding rules regarding the maintenance, storage, transmission and destruction of consumer data.  Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.  The timing and effects of potential legislative or regulatory changes to data privacy regulations is uncertain.
 In addition, the dealers who originate our retail and lease contracts also must comply with federal credit and trade practice statutes and regulations.  Failure of the dealers to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in remedies that could have an adverse effect on us. 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over entities offering consumer financial services or products, including non-bank companies, such as TMCC (“Covered Entities”).  The CFPB’s rulemaking authority includes the authority to promulgate rules regarding, among other practices, debt collection practices that would apply to third-party collectors and first-party collectors, such as ourselves, and rules regarding consumer credit reporting practices.  The timing and impact of these rules on our business remain uncertain.
 In addition, the CFPB has questioned the value and increased scrutiny of the marketing and sale of certain ancillary or add-on products, including products similar to those we finance or sell through TMIS.  


11


The CFPB has also focused on the area of auto finance, particularly with respect to indirect financing arrangements, dealer compensation and fair lending compliance. In March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin addressing compliance with the fair lending requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B.  The bulletin addressed the practice of indirect auto lenders purchasing financing contracts executed between dealers and consumers and paying dealers for the contracts at a discount below the rates dealers charge consumers.  It also outlined steps that indirect auto lenders should take in order to comply with fair lending laws regarding dealer markup and compensation policies. On May 21, 2018, President Trump signed into law a resolution repealing the CFPB’s fair lending guidance contained in the bulletin.  Because this resolution was enacted under the authority of the Congressional Review Act, the CFPB is prohibited from issuing substantially similar guidance related to indirect auto financing in the future without Congressional approval.
 The CFPB’s supervisory authority permits it to examine Covered Entities for compliance with consumer financial protection laws. These examinations could result in enforcement actions, regulatory fines and mandated changes to our business, products, policies and procedures.  
 The CFPB’s enforcement authority permits it to conduct investigations (which may include a joint investigation with other agencies and regulators) of, and initiate enforcement actions related to, violations of federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other types of affirmative relief), or other forms of remediation, and/or impose monetary penalties.  The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) may investigate the products, services and operations of credit providers, including banks and other finance companies engaged in auto finance activities.  As a result of such investigations, both the CFPB and FTC have announced various enforcement actions against lenders in the past few years involving significant penalties, consent orders, cease and desist orders and similar remedies that, if applicable to us or the products, services and operations we offer, may require us to cease or alter certain business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.    
 As previously disclosed, in February 2016, we entered into consent orders with the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice (collectively, the “Agencies”) to reflect the settlement of the Agencies’ allegations regarding our purchases of auto finance contracts from dealers and related discretionary dealer compensation practices (together, the “Consent Orders”).  The Consent Orders were to be effective for three years, until February 2019, unless we met certain requirements at the end of the second year of the Consent Orders, in which case, the term of the Consent Orders could be reduced from three years to two years.  
 The Agencies concluded that we satisfied the requirements for early termination of the Consent Orders and terminated the Consent Orders effective May 1, 2018.  The termination of the Consent Orders was conditioned upon our completion of the distribution of the consumer restitution funds required by the Consent Orders.  In February 2019, we completed the distribution of the consumer restitution, which substantially completes our obligations under the Consent Orders.  
 State Regulation
 A majority of states (and Puerto Rico) have enacted legislation establishing licensing requirements to conduct financing activities. We must renew these licenses periodically.  Most states also impose limits on the maximum rate of finance charges.  In certain states, the margin between the present statutory maximum interest rates and borrowing costs is sufficiently narrow that, in periods of rapidly increasing or high interest rates, there could be an adverse effect on our operations in these states if we were unable to pass on increased interest costs to our customers.  Some state laws impose rate and other restrictions on credit transactions with customers in active military status in addition to those imposed by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
 State laws also impose requirements and restrictions on us with respect to, among other matters, required credit application and finance and lease disclosures, late fees and other charges, the right to repossess a vehicle for failure to pay or other defaults under the retail or lease contract, other rights and remedies we may exercise in the event of a default under the retail or lease contract, and other consumer protection matters.  Many states are also focusing on cybersecurity and data privacy as areas warranting consumer protection.  Some states have passed complex legislation dealing with consumer information, which impacts companies such as TMCC.  


12


TMIS operations are subject to state regulations and licensing requirements.  State laws vary with respect to which products are regulated and what types of corporate licenses and filings are required to offer certain products.  Certain products offered by TMIS are covered by state privacy laws as well as new cybersecurity and data privacy legislation.  Our insurance company subsidiaries must be appropriately licensed in certain states in which they conduct business, must maintain minimum capital requirements and file annual financial information as determined by their state of domicile and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse effect on insurance operations in a particular state.  We actively monitor applicable laws and regulations in each state in order to maintain compliance.
 State regulators are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating providers of financial products and services subject to their jurisdiction.  We expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements for the foreseeable future.  For example, on January 28, 2015, we received a request for documents and information from the New York State Department of Financial Services relating to our lending practices (including fair lending).  We provided the requested documents and information, but have not had further communication with the New York State Department of Financial Services regarding its review.
 Other Federal and International Regulation
 The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which may designate non-bank financial companies that pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system (“SIFIs”) to be supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is required to establish and apply enhanced prudential standards to SIFIs, including capital, liquidity, counterparty exposure, resolution plan and overall risk management standards.  The FSOC uses a multi-stage review process to evaluate non-bank financial companies for potential designation and supervision by the Federal Reserve.  If we were designated for supervision after this multi-stage review process and any available appeal processes, we could experience increased compliance costs, the need to change our business practices, impairments to our profitability and competitiveness and other adverse effects on our business.
 Under the Volcker Rule, companies affiliated with U.S. insured depository institutions are generally prohibited from engaging in “proprietary trading” and certain transactions with certain privately offered funds.  The activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule are not core activities for us. Accordingly, we do not believe the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations are likely to have a material effect on our business or operations.  In the future, however, the federal financial regulatory agencies charged with implementing the Volcker Rule could amend the rule or change their approach to administering, enforcing or interpreting the rule, which could negatively affect us and potentially require us to limit or change our activities or operations.
 The Dodd-Frank Act amended the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) to establish a comprehensive framework for the regulation of certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives referred to as swaps.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is required to adopt certain rules and regulations governing swaps.  The CFTC has completed the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect.
 The OTC derivatives provisions of the CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, impose clearing, trading and margin requirements on certain contracts.  At present, we qualify for exceptions from these requirements for the swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks.  However, if we were to no longer qualify for such exceptions, we could become subject to some or all of these requirements, which would increase our cost of entering into and maintaining such hedging positions.  Moreover, the application of the clearing, trading and margin requirements, and other related regulations, to our dealer counterparties may change the cost and availability of the OTC derivatives that we use for hedging.  Certain other requirements, such as reporting and recordkeeping, also apply to such instruments, but are not expected to have a material impact on us.
 The full impact of the OTC derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the market for derivatives contracts has fully adjusted to this new regulatory regime. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations could have the ultimate effect of significantly increasing the cost of OTC derivative contracts, materially altering the terms of OTC derivative contracts, reducing the availability of OTC derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reducing our ability to monetize or restructure our existing OTC derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of OTC derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and resulting regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.

The current administration under President Trump has sought and passed legislation to revise elements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Although the current administration has indicated a goal of further reforming aspects of its existing financial services regulations, it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law, whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified, or what effect such passage, adoption or modification will have, whether positive or negative, on us or on our industry. 
 We continually review our operations for compliance with applicable laws.  Future administrative rulings, judicial decisions, legislation, regulations and regulatory guidance, and supervision and enforcement actions may result in monetary penalties, increase our compliance costs, require changes in our business practices, affect our competitiveness, impair our profitability, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Refer to Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
