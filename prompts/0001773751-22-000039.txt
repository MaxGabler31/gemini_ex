Item 1. Business
Overview
Launched in 2017, Hims & Hers has built a proprietary solution that connects consumers to licensed healthcare professionals for the provision of care via telehealth across a broad range of conditions, including those related to sexual health, hair loss, dermatology, mental health and primary care, among others, as well as provides access for customers to licensed pharmacies for online fulfillment and distribution of certain medications that may be prescribed as part of telehealth consultations. Since our founding, the Company has facilitated more than four million telehealth consultations, enabling greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable care for people in all 50 states and select locations in the United Kingdom.
The mission of Hims & Hers is to make healthcare accessible, affordable, and convenient for everyone. We believe that the Company has the technical platform, distributed provider network, and access to clinical capabilities to lead the migration of routine office visits to a digital format. The Hims & Hers platform includes access to a highly-qualified and technologically-capable provider network, a clinically-focused electronic medical record system, digital prescriptions, and cloud pharmacy fulfillment. We have built distribution channels and expertise around identifying and monetizing consumers that is enhanced by innovative engagement strategies delivered through simple and intuitive mobile and web interfaces. The Hims & Hers platform offers a streamlined patient and clinician experience facilitated by proprietary algorithms and a customizable and integrated technology stack, allowing us to give customers a seamless experience and to follow up programmatically and with precision. This creates a virtuous data cycle driven by the thousands of consultations performed on the platform on a daily basis and provides clarity on the healthcare needs of the Hims & Hers customer base. Customers can access healthcare providers on their computers or mobile devices and can have prescribed medications delivered directly. Care accessed through the Hims & Hers platform is subject to evidence-based clinical guidelines and delivered by highly-trained healthcare providers to ensure consistency and quality. Significant quality assurance measures are implemented to maintain safety and quality, and over 39,000 visit encounters have been reviewed by a clinical quality team to monitor quality of care and provider adherence to evidence-based principles.
Business Strategy
We are a multi-specialty telehealth platform focused on providing modern personalized health and wellness experiences to consumers. We offer a range of health and wellness products and services available for customers to purchase through our websites and mobile application. The offerings generally focus on chronic conditions, where treatment typically involves use of prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. We also offer over-the-counter drug and device products and cosmetics and supplement products, which are primarily focused on general wellness, sexual health and wellness, skincare, and hair care. These curated non-prescription products include vitamin C, melatonin, biotin and collagen protein supplements in the wellness category, moisturizer, serums and face wash in the skincare category, condoms, climax delay spray and wipes, vibrators and lubricants in the sexual health and wellness category, and shampoos, conditioners, scalp scrubs and topical treatments such as minoxidil in the hair care category. We also offer many of these over-the-counter products through retail partnerships, in stores and online. The over-the-counter drug and device products and some of the cosmetics and supplement products we sell are “white-labeled” products, where we sell the manufacturer-developed product under the Hims & Hers brand name or co-branded along with the manufacturer’s brand. Several cosmetics and supplement products have been developed by us in partnership with the applicable manufacturers. For these products, the manufacturer develops the formulation with input from the internal Hims & Hers Product Research & Development team. In all cases, the manufacturer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), if required, and complying with current Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMP) as adopted and enforced by the FDA. In addition, the internal Hims & Hers Quality team is responsible for maintaining policies and procedures to ensure non-prescription products comply with quality standards, which include independent laboratory testing of products, supplier quality and compliance assessments, and handling of product complaints and adverse events reported by customers.
Most of the offerings on our websites and mobile application are sold to customers on a subscription basis. Subscription plans provide an easy and convenient way for customers to get the ongoing treatment they need while simultaneously providing the Company with predictability through a recurring revenue stream.
For subscription plans, customers select a desired cadence to receive products, which can range from every month to every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed on a recurring basis based on the selected cadence and a specified quantity of product is shipped at each billing. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products. Our integrated 
technology platform allows us to serve our customers efficiently from start to finish: initially from customer discovery and purchase of offerings on our websites and mobile application, to connecting customers with medical providers for telehealth consultations, to the fulfillment and delivery of customer orders, and finally through ongoing clinical management by medical providers. Management believes this technology-driven efficiency provides cost advantages that allow us to offer customers affordable prices and to generate robust gross margins.
We acquire new customers and drive brand awareness through various marketing channels, including social media, online search, television, radio, other media channels, presence in brick-and-mortar retail stores, and physical brand advertising campaigns. We intend to continue to invest in growth in our current offerings and additionally in new products and services. The Hims & Hers platform is purpose-built to scale efficiently and to accommodate the seamless addition of new products and services. We plan to launch new subscription-based offerings which we expect will have a similar margin profile and unit economics to current offerings. As we implement our product roadmap, we expect to grow revenue through additional subscription-based recurring revenue offerings. The recent launches of new products and services in behavioral health, dermatology, and primary care demonstrate the scalability of the platform.
Acquisitions 
In June 2021, we completed our acquisition of United Kingdom based Honest Health Limited (“HHL”), a company that offers health and wellness products and services. The acquisition of HHL has allowed us to expand our operations in the United Kingdom and laid the groundwork for possible further expansion into Europe in the future. In July 2021, we completed our acquisition of YoDerm, Inc. (“Apostrophe”), allowing us to expand personalized dermatological offerings to our customers.
Growth Opportunities
Continue to acquire more customers
Customers serve as ambassadors for the Hims & Hers brand, further driving organic growth through word of mouth and user-generated content. The convenience of our websites and mobile application allows us to reduce stigma and access-related barriers that frequently prevent consumers from seeking medical care, expanding the Company’s market opportunity. Organic growth is enhanced by sophisticated omni-channel acquisition strategies meant to target future customers with condition specific on-ramps at profitable returns on investment. In addition, our brand positioning has afforded significant partnerships with leading talent whose promotional efforts drive meaningful awareness of the products and services we make available. As our portfolio of products and services grows across categories, we believe that our market presence and brand recognition will expand, driving more consumers to seek out Hims & Hers for future healthcare needs.
Grow within existing customer base
Our relatively young customer base is representative of the future healthcare consumer base. Approximately 80% of our customers to date indicate that they came to Hims & Hers to learn about and find options for their condition and are seeking treatment for their particular conditions for the first time. In addition, the majority of our customers are millennials at the beginning of their healthcare journey and we intend to grow with them as their healthcare needs evolve. We believe this demographic will make up the majority of healthcare spend in the coming decades, and as such it has intentionally built its brand and technologies to align with the expectations of this consumer group.
Category expansion into new chronic conditions
We are pursuing a roadmap of rapid category expansion into new chronic and often stigmatized conditions that can be treated safely via telehealth, require ongoing and recurring customer relationships, and for which generic medication has been established as an effective means of treatment. Future chronic care opportunities that show high prevalence within our existing customer base and offer traits similar to its existing categories in terms of business model characteristics include sleep disorders, infertility, diabetes, weight loss, cholesterol, and hypertension, which represent significant opportunities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, six out of every ten individuals in the United States currently suffer from a chronic condition, and four out of every ten individuals suffer from two or more chronic conditions. Given the prevalence of these conditions, we see a large market opportunity for our current and future offerings.
Leverage existing capabilities to penetrate new sales channels and further improve operations
In 2020, we opened an approximately 300,000 square foot facility in New Albany, Ohio. In 2021, this facility began housing a dedicated licensed mail order pharmacy, XeCare, LLC (or “XeCare”), that provides prescription fulfillment services solely to Hims & Hers customers. Apostrophe Pharmacy LLC (“Apostrophe Pharmacy,” and together with XeCare, the “Affiliated Pharmacies”), is an additional dedicated licensed mail order pharmacy located in Arizona that provides prescription fulfillment services solely to Hims & Hers customers as part of our acquisition of Apostrophe in 2021. The Affiliated Pharmacies together enable seamless drug delivery, and drive increased operating leverage across the platform by allowing us to further personalize and consolidate shipping of orders as well as expand capabilities quickly for adjacent and other new conditions. The Affiliated Pharmacies allow us to lower our cost structure by reducing some of the costs typically associated with contractual third-party pharmacy relationships. Additionally, the Affiliated Pharmacies will provide an opportunity to incorporate insurance reimbursement into our system, which we intend to do as early as this fiscal year, ultimately enabling drug coverage and allowing us to provide access to treatment for a broader range of conditions with enhanced treatment flexibility and personalization for customers.
Expand into new geographies
Our strong brand and digital-first, cloud-based business model has driven rapid adoption in the U.S. Additionally, our model has been developed to be scalable and applicable across new markets and languages which allowed us to expand into the U.K. in 2021 and will afford us further international expansion opportunities. The global market for chronic diseases is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, and we believe the consumer-focused services it provides are applicable to a range of geographies across the world.
Affiliated Medical Groups, Providers and Partner Pharmacies
Affiliated Medical Groups and Providers
Due to the prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine adopted by a majority of states in the U.S., we have contractual arrangements with Affiliated Medical Groups to enable their provision of clinical services to our customers. “Affiliated Medical Groups” are separate professional corporations or other professional entities owned solely by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals, to provide telehealth consultations and related services, including applicable physician supervision of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We are prohibited from owning a professional entity such as the Affiliated Medical Groups under the rules prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine. However, the Affiliated Medical Groups were incorporated and established with our assistance for the specific purpose of providing clinical services to patients through the Hims & Hers platform and have no other operations or activities outside of the provision of services through the Hims & Hers platform.
The Affiliated Medical Groups contract with or employ physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and behavioral health providers to provide telehealth consultations and related services on the Hims & Hers platform. We enter into certain contractual agreements with the Affiliated Medical Groups and their physician owners, including administrative services agreements and continuity agreements, under which we serve as an administrative services manager for the Affiliated Medical Groups for the non-clinical aspects of their operations and receive a fixed administrative fee from each Affiliated Medical Group for these services. The administrative services and support we provide include IT products and support, including the Hims & Hers platform and electronic medical record system, billing and collection services, non-clinical personnel, customer service support, administrative support for provider credentialing and quality assurance, and other non-clinical items and services, including access to a line of credit we make available to the Affiliated Medical Groups as necessary to support their operations. The Affiliated Medical Groups retain sole control of clinical decision-making and the practice of medicine. We are the exclusive administrative services provider for the Affiliated Medical Groups, and the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services to patients exclusively through the platform. Our arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups generally have initial ten-year terms with renewal options. These arrangements are reviewed and updated periodically to address changing regulatory or market conditions. 
Health System Partnerships
The strength of the Hims & Hers brand affords us numerous opportunities to partner with and offer new solutions to help transform existing healthcare stakeholders. We have relationships with leading health systems including Ochsner Health, Mount Sinai Health System, and Privia to provide a clinically focused, telehealth-enabled patient care collaboration. These 
relationships offer our customers access to applicable in-person care within these systems to enhance their overall healthcare experience. These collaborations, which are intended to help Hims & Hers customers obtain in-person care not accessible through the Hims & Hers platform, do not involve any monetary exchange, compensation, or other financial incentives between the parties. For primary care prescriptions, we also allow customers to seamlessly fulfill their prescription for same day delivery through Capsule and Alto in select markets.
Partner Pharmacies
We have entered into contractual arrangements with two licensed pharmacies (sometimes referred to herein as “partner pharmacies”), PostMeds, Inc. (d/b/a TruePill) and EHT Pharmacy, LLC (d/b/a Curexa Pharmacy) for fulfillment and distribution of certain prescription and non-prescription products available through its platform. We are not bound by any exclusivity or minimum order requirements with respect to our use of either pharmacy, and have the ability to utilize other pharmacies at our discretion. The contractual arrangements with the pharmacies are typically for one-year terms with automatic renewals, subject to standard termination rights of the parties. The pharmacies’ rates are fixed in the contractual arrangements and changes require the mutual agreement of the parties.
We have also entered into service agreements with XeCare and, as part of the Apostrophe acquisition discussed in Note 4 – Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Apostrophe Pharmacy, in each case for the provision of prescription fulfillment services solely to Hims & Hers customers. 
Regulatory Environment
As a consumer-driven healthcare organization delivering comprehensive telehealth technologies and services, in addition to the typical legal and regulatory considerations faced by a technology-based company, we are required to comply with complex healthcare laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. Our business and operations are subject to extensive regulation, including with respect to the practice of medicine, the use of telehealth, relationships with healthcare providers, and privacy and security of personal health information.
Government regulation of healthcare generally
Generally speaking, the healthcare industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. Healthcare businesses are subject to a broad array of governmental regulation at the federal, state, and local levels. While portions of our business are subject to significant regulations, some of the more well-known healthcare regulations do not apply to the Company because of the way our current operations are structured. We currently accept payments only from our customers—not any third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs or health insurers. Because of this approach, we are not subject to many of the laws and regulations that impact other participants in healthcare industry. If we begin accepting reimbursement payments from insurance providers or other third-party payors such as a government program as we intend to do, we will become subject to some of these additional healthcare laws and regulations.
Irrespective of our business model, the healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect healthcare companies like Hims & Hers. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and subject to potential disruption due to legislative initiatives and government regulation, as well as judicial interpretations thereof. While these regulations may not directly impact us or our offerings in any given case, they will affect the healthcare industry as a whole and may impact customer use of the Company’s solutions. If the government asserts broader regulatory control over companies like us or if we realize our intention to accept payment from and/or participate in third-party payor programs, the complexity of our operations and our compliance obligations will materially increase.
Government regulation of the practice of medicine and telehealth
The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the qualifications of the provider, the practice of medicine (including specific requirements when providing health care utilizing telehealth technologies and the provision of remote care), the continuity and adequacy of medical care, the maintenance of medical records, the supervision of personnel, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. Because the practice of telehealth is relatively new and rapidly developing, regulation of telehealth is evolving and the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and standards 
can be uncertain or uneven. As a result, we must continually monitor legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments regarding the practice of medicine and telehealth in order to support the Affiliated Medical Groups.
Physicians, mid-level providers (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners), and behavioral health providers who provide professional clinical services via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to provide the applicable professional services in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems to assist the Affiliated Medical Groups in ensuring that their providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our customers occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some state and federal regulatory authorities lowered certain barriers to the practice of telehealth in order to make remote healthcare services more accessible. Due to our business model, these changes did not dramatically change our operations, but these changes did introduce many people to the practice of telehealth. It is unclear whether these changes will have a long-term impact on the adoption of telehealth services by the general public or legislative and regulatory authorities.
Corporate practice of medicine laws in the U.S.; Fee splitting
In certain jurisdictions, the corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits non-physicians from practicing medicine, including by employing physicians to provide clinical services, directing the clinical practice of physicians, or holding an ownership interest in an entity that employs physicians. Some states have similar doctrines with respect to other professional licensure categories, including behavioral health services and providers. Other practices, such as professionals splitting their professional fees with non-professional persons or entities, is also prohibited in some jurisdictions. These laws are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or unduly influencing a physician’s professional judgment. State laws and enforcement activities related to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting vary dramatically. In some states, even activities not directly related to the delivery of clinical services may be considered an element of the practice of medicine. For example, in some states the corporate practice of medicine restrictions may be implicated by non-clinical activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel.
Because of the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine doctrine and fee-splitting in various jurisdictions, we do not employ the healthcare providers who provide clinical services on the Hims & Hers platform. Instead, the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services on the platform and we contract with but do not own the Affiliated Medical Groups. The Affiliated Medical Groups and their providers maintain exclusive authority regarding the provision of healthcare services (including consults that may lead to the writing of prescriptions) and remain responsible for retaining and compensating their providers, credentialing decisions regarding their providers, maintaining professional standards, maintaining clinical documentation within medical records, establishing their own fee schedule, and submitting accurate information to us so that we can bill customers. Despite our care in structuring arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups, it is possible that a regulatory authority or another party, including providers affiliated with Affiliated Medical Groups, could assert that we (or other organizations with similar business models) are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with Affiliated Medical Groups violate a state’s fee-splitting prohibition. Failure to comply with these state laws could lead to materially adverse consequences for the Company.
U.S. Federal and State fraud and abuse laws
Participants in the United States healthcare industry are subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to kickbacks, physician self-referral arrangements, false claims, and other fraud and abuse issues. For example, the federal anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The penalties for violating these laws can be severe, including criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs.
Given our current operations, the Anti-Kickback Law, the federal False Claim Act, and other laws that are tied to federal health care program or commercial insurer reimbursement should not apply to our business. If the scope of these laws is extended to include a broader spectrum of activities or if we realize our intention to accept reimbursement payments from insurance 
providers or other third-party payors such as a government program, we could become subject to these laws and need to modify our business model. Additionally, should we begin accepting reimbursement payments from insurance providers or other third-party payors, which we intend to do as early as this fiscal year, the Company will be subject to significantly increased compliance obligations and costs.
FDA regulation
The products available through the Hims & Hers platform are regulated by the FDA and are subject to the limitations placed by the FDA on the approved uses in the product prescribing information. The FDA regulates product promotion and noncompliance with the FDA’s regulations could result in the FDA requesting that we modify product promotion or subject us to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities monitor product promotion and have the authority to levy significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement, if violations of applicable law or regulations occur.
Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous U.S. state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, and other processing of health information. We believe that, because of our operating processes, we are not a covered entity or a business associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), which establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notwithstanding that we do not believe that the Company meets the definition of a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, we have executed business associate agreements with certain other parties and has assumed obligations that are based upon HIPAA-related requirements. Because we need to use and disclose customers’ health and personal information in order to provide our services, we have developed and maintain policies and procedures to protect that information, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of health information and other types of personal information. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changing or differing interpretations. Additionally, these laws may be similar to or even more protective than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. The privacy and data protection laws in many states in which we operate are more restrictive than HIPAA and/or may apply more broadly than HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) protects the personal information of California consumers regardless of the location of the business holding the information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act passed in 2020 (“CPRA”) expands upon the rights and requirements implemented through the CCPA, with enforcement of the CPRA to become effective January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, requiring the Company to incur additional costs and expenses and modify certain of our privacy practices. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA or apply more broadly than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future; state laws are changing rapidly, numerous states are currently reviewing legislation that is similar to the CCPA and/or CPRA, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law. 
Additionally, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as implemented in the United Kingdom (the “UK GDPR”). The GDPR became effective in the European Union (“EU”) on May 25, 2018. Under the GDPR, data protection authorities have the power to impose significant administrative fines for violations, which may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. The United Kingdom completed its withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 in a process known as “Brexit,” and following the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, the UK GDPR has been implemented in the United Kingdom. The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the GDPR into UK law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the UK but who process personal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the UK, or to monitor their behavior, are subject to the UK GDPR - the requirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the GDPR and may lead to significant compliance and operational costs. 
Marketing
We are building brands that represent the front door to the healthcare system for a new generation of healthcare customers. From our launch, we have used a diverse marketing strategy to reach our customers. We advertise on social media, online search, television, radio, out-of-home, and other media channels. We believe advertising in a diversified set of media channels is important to prevent overreliance on any single channel and to maximize the exposure of our brands to our desired customers. We also reach our customers through our own social media accounts, press coverage and public relations, internally developed educational and lifestyle content, presence in brick-and-mortar retail stores, and physical brand advertising campaigns. This overall strategy drives significant customer traffic to our platform, including direct type-in traffic and organic online search traffic.
Our marketing strategy is underpinned by a focus on analytics and data. We have built our team and systems to measure consumer behavior, including which types of consumers generate more revenue in their first purchase, generate more revenue over time, generate more gross profit from their purchases, and which types of consumers are most valuable over their lifetime. We also rigorously measure the effectiveness of our marketing budgets and the rate of return we generates from our marketing campaigns. The marketing team is accountable for driving a sufficient rate of return from their budgets. We view our marketing capabilities as a core strength of the Company and a key differentiator in the market.
Human Capital Management
People and Culture
At Hims & Hers, we center justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion (JEDI). Our commitment to live and practice these values is unwavering. They are central to our mission to transform the health and wellness industry and to become the front door to healthcare. We believe that celebrating multiple approaches and perspectives internally allows us to better meet the challenge of providing people-centered healthcare. We continue to look for ways to expand a range of programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop, and retain our workforce and center our JEDI strategy.
We strive to hire the best and brightest talent across the industry with a focus on individuals determined to improve access to healthcare for millions. As of December 31, 2021, our team was comprised of 398 full-time employees across various functions. 
We took prompt action to protect our employees’ health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by closing our offices in March 2020 and shifting to an official remote-first policy in June 2020. We have heavily invested in the software, tools, and culture that allow our company to be a leading force in the new remote-oriented work environment. Not only has this allowed us to maintain and enhance our commitment to quality, our management team believes it has also provided a real competitive advantage by attracting top talent and garnering new geographic exposure. We have a strong focus on building a diverse and inclusive workforce and we seek individuals who are differentiated in their excitement to be leading the charge into a consumer-focused healthcare future. Because we prioritize hiring team members with a variety of lived experiences, we believe we get the benefit of more multi-faceted and nuanced insight into the customers we serve. This also ensures that our internal community reflects our vision for an equity-centered, inclusive workforce. 
Our work environment is one of mutual trust, confidence, and inclusion to provide opportunity for growth and recognition, with the ultimate goal of delivering better healthcare to more consumers. We are a company with a growth mindset; one of our mantras is “never stop learning, never stop growing.” To that end, we gauge our employees’ level of engagement and satisfaction through bi-annual engagement surveys. These surveys ensure we hear directly from our employees on their personal work experiences and how we can continue working to manifest our value set. We evaluate the data obtained through these surveys to architect learning pathways that are truly useful to our employees. For example, we have periodically offered trainings in feedback, hiring, interviewing, and non-violent communication. We also make space for our managers to help their team members develop their knowledge base by earmarking individualized external training courses, certifications, and resource tools.
Further, we have committed to and formalized employee development programs that support our JEDI strategy, and promote creativity and innovation. Programming includes a formalized performance review process that includes a self-evaluation process and a manager self-evaluation process, together with training and resources on how to approach these evaluations.
We also offer our employees a holistic total rewards package with premier benefit and well-being programs intended to fit the needs of our employees and their family members. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs, short-term and long-term disability coverage, and life insurance. We also offer a 401(K) Savings Plan and the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to all U.S. employees. In addition, the majority of our employees are eligible for equity awards, depending on function, to align incentives and provide the opportunity to share in the Company’s financial success. Additionally, our paid time off programs enable our workforce to enjoy personal time away from their job responsibilities.
Commitment to highest standards of provider quality
In addition to our employees, as of December 31, 2021, 344 medical providers located throughout all 50 states in the U.S. provided services on the Hims & Hers platform through the Affiliated Medical Groups. These medical professionals adhere to a rigorous set of assessments and all credentials, licenses, and qualifications are cross-checked against federal, state, and other agencies. The Affiliated Medical Groups implement comprehensive processes, including written testing, to ensure adequate clinical skill and quality. Testing results are reviewed by an advisory board of physicians, with only the most qualified applicants approved by the Affiliated Medical Groups to provide consultations on the Hims & Hers platform. This rigor in provider selection ensures a strong culture of high standards focused around improving healthcare outcomes for our customers.
Competition
Consumers have historically accessed the healthcare system in the U.S. through an antiquated model focused around brick-and-mortar healthcare providers and cost coverage through commercial and government payor programs. At the same time, many consumers are not aware of the relative affordability, convenience, and accessibility of care through the use of telehealth. Much of our marketing efforts since our founding have thus focused on consumer education around these capabilities and the underlying chronic and often stigmatized conditions that providers on our platform can help treat. The relatively low (albeit rapidly increasing) penetration of telehealth implies that there is a significant market opportunity as consumers continue to shift their behavior.
While we do not believe there are currently any direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions and direct-to-consumer touch points as we do, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address chronic conditions that compete with our solutions.
•In direct-to-consumer healthcare, our competition is largely fragmented and consists of many competitors that are smaller in scale and/or are more niche in focus with respect to the conditions they treat. Within parts of the sexual health and hair loss market, we also compete mostly with private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers.
•In telehealth and chronic disease management, we compete with other providers that are larger in scale and generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans. Within parts of the behavioral health market, we also compete with public and private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers.
•In direct-to-consumer health and wellness, we compete with traditional healthcare providers, pharmacies, and large retailers that sell non-prescription products, including, for example, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and hair care treatments.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technology platform, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without violating the intellectual property rights of others is important to our success. We have a number of measures to protect our intellectual property and brand, including trademarks, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2021, we held ten registered trademarks in the U.S. and 21 in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 23 pending trademarks in the U.S. and 105 in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including pending trademarks for our brand, Hims & Hers. We 
obtained our first registered trademark in December 2018 with the majority of our trademark registrations obtained between 2019 and 2021. Each trademark registration is due for renewal within ten years from the date of its respective registration date and may be renewed in ten year intervals thereafter. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.forhims.com and www.forhers.com. We hold no patents at this time.
Additional Information
Our website addresses are www.forhims.com and www.forhers.com. We make available free of charge at the Investor Relations section of the forhims.com website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish such materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC also maintains a website located at www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The information on our website is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings with the SEC, except where we expressly incorporated such information.
