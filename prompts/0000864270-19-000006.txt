Item 1. Business
Overview
American Honda Finance Corporation (AHFC) is a California corporation that was incorporated on February 6, 1980. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” in this report include AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to “AHFC” refer solely to American Honda Finance Corporation (excluding its subsidiaries). AHFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (AHM). Honda Canada Finance Inc. (HCFI) is a majority-owned subsidiary of AHFC. Noncontrolling interest in HCFI is held by Honda Canada Inc. (HCI), an affiliate of AHFC. AHM is a wholly-owned subsidiary and HCI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC). AHM and HCI are the sole authorized distributors of Honda and Acura products, including motor vehicles, parts, and accessories in the United States and Canada. AHFC’s principal executive offices are located at 20800 Madrona Avenue, Torrance, California 90503.
We provide various forms of financing in the United States and Canada to purchasers and lessees of Honda and Acura products and authorized independent dealers of Honda and Acura products. Our primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. Our business is substantially dependent upon the sale of those Honda and Acura products in the United States and Canada and the percentage of those sales financed by us.
We acquire retail loans, primarily installment sale contracts, and leases made to retail customers of Honda and Acura products and we offer wholesale flooring and commercial loans to dealers of Honda and Acura products.
AHM and HCI sponsor incentive-financing programs in the United States and Canada, respectively. These programs offer promotional rates on loans and leases to purchasers, lessees, and dealers of Honda and Acura products. AHM or HCI, as applicable, pays a subsidy that enables us to realize a market yield on any financing contract we indirectly or directly finance under these programs.
We acquire and offer, as applicable, substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, provinces, and territories, subject to local legal restrictions and market conditions. We divide our business segments between our business in the United States and in Canada. For additional financial information regarding our operations by business segment, see Note 15—Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part II, Item 7.

Consumer Financing
Retail Loans
We provide indirect financing to retail customers of Honda and Acura products by acquiring retail loans originated by Honda and Acura dealers. Retail loans are acquired in accordance with our underwriting standards. See “—Underwriting and Pricing of Consumer Financing” below for a description of our underwriting process. The products that we finance consist primarily of new and used Honda and Acura automobiles and Honda motorcycles, power equipment, and marine engines. Retail loans may also include the financing of insurance products or vehicle service contracts. See “—Vehicle Service Contract Administration” below for more information. The terms of retail loans originated in the United States generally range from 24 to 72 months while the terms of retail loans originated in Canada generally range from 24 to 84 months.
We service all of the retail loans we acquire. We generally hold a security interest in the products purchased through our retail loans. As a result, if our collection efforts fail to bring a delinquent customer’s payments current, we generally can repossess the customer’s vehicle, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it at auction. We may waive late payment fees and other fees assessed in the ordinary course of servicing the retail loans and allow payment deferrals by extending the loan’s term. See “—Servicing of Consumer Financing” below for more information.
We require customers that purchase Honda and Acura products through retail loans acquired by us to obtain adequate physical damage, comprehensive and collision insurance.
Retail Leases
We acquire closed-end vehicle lease contracts between Honda and Acura dealers and their customers primarily for leases of new Honda and Acura automobiles. In the case of leases originating in the United States, upon our acquisition of such leases, the dealer assigns all of its rights, title, and interest in the lease and the automobile to either our wholly-owned subsidiary, Honda Lease Trust (HLT) or its trustee, HVT, Inc., depending on the applicable state. HLT is a trust established to take assignments of and serve as holder of legal title to leased automobiles. In the case of leases originating in Canada, upon our acquisition of such leases, the dealer assigns all of its rights, title, and interest in the lease and the vehicle to our majority owned subsidiary HCFI.
Leases are acquired in accordance with our underwriting standards. See “—Underwriting and Pricing of Consumer Financing” below for a description of our underwriting process. Terms of the leases generally range from 24 to 60 months. We service the leases we acquire. We may waive late payment fees and other fees assessed in the ordinary course of servicing the leases, extend the lease term, or offer end-of-lease incentives. See “—Servicing of Consumer Financing” below for more information.
Contractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealer are sold through online and physical auctions. See “—Servicing of Consumer Financing—Remarketing Center” below.
We require the lessee to obtain insurance with adequate public liability and physical damage coverage for the entire lease term.
Underwriting and Pricing of Consumer Financing
Dealers submit customer credit applications electronically through our online system. In addition, AHFC customers are able to submit their own credit applications for pre-approval directly through our website. If our requirements are met, an application received from a dealer is approved automatically. Our system is programmed to review application information for purchase policy and legal compliance. Applications that are not automatically approved are routed to credit buyers located in our regional offices, who will evaluate and make purchase decisions within the framework of our purchase policy and legal requirements.
2

We utilize our proprietary credit scoring system to evaluate the credit risk of applicants. Factors used by our credit scoring system to develop a customer’s credit grade include the term of the contract, the loan or lease-to-value ratio, the customer’s debt ratios, and credit bureau attributes, number of trade lines, utilization ratio, and number of credit inquiries. A customer’s credit grade is determined only at the time of origination and is not reassessed during the life of the contract. We utilize different scorecards depending on the type of product we finance and we regularly review and analyze our consumer-financing portfolio to ensure the effectiveness of our underwriting guidelines, purchasing criteria and scorecard predictability of our customers.
In the United States, AHFC utilizes a tiered pricing structure based on customer Fair Isaac Corporation/FICO scores. In Canada, HCFI has a single tiered pricing structure.
Servicing of Consumer Financing
We have eight regional offices in the United States that are responsible for the acquisition, servicing, collection, and customer service activities related to our automobile retail loans and leases. These offices are located in California, Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois, North Carolina, Delaware, and Georgia. We also have one office in Georgia that is responsible for the underwriting of motorcycle, power equipment, and marine engine loans, customer service related to those contracts and collection efforts for past due accounts on a national basis.
In addition to our servicing regions, we have centralized certain operational functions in the United States relating to our automobile retail loans and leases at the National Service Center located in Texas, which contains our National Processing Center, Lease Maturity Center, Remarketing Center, and Recovery and Bankruptcy Center, which are described below:

• | National Processing Center. The National Processing Center is responsible for processing customer payments that cannot be processed through our automated servicing system, providing service to our Regional Offices and other services.


• | Lease Maturity Center. Lease accounts are transferred from our regional offices to the Lease Maturity Center six months prior to the end of the lease term. The Lease Maturity Center assumes responsibility for servicing the lease from this time, including providing the leaseholder with end of term options, responding to customer service issues and coordinating end of term vehicle inspections. Once a vehicle is returned to us, the Lease Maturity Center transfers the account to the Remarketing Center to arrange for the disposition of the vehicle.


• | Remarketing Center. The Remarketing Center oversees the disposition of vehicles returned at the end of leases and after repossession. In order to minimize losses at lease maturity, we have developed remarketing strategies to maximize proceeds and minimize disposition costs on vehicles sold at lease termination. We use various channels to sell vehicles returned at lease end, including a dealer direct, on-line program referred to as the Vehicle Inter-Dealer Purchase System (VIPS) and physical auctions. The goal of our VIPS program is to increase dealer purchases of off-lease vehicles thereby reducing our disposition costs of such vehicles. Through VIPS, the dealer accepting return of the leased vehicle (also referred to as the grounding dealer) initially has the exclusive right to purchase the vehicle at the contractual residual value or a market-based price. If the vehicle is not purchased by the grounding dealer, it then becomes available to Honda and Acura vehicle dealers through the VIPS online auction. If the vehicle is not sold to a Honda or Acura dealer, the auction is opened to any dealer. Off-lease vehicles that are not purchased through a VIPS auction and all repossessed vehicles are sold at physical auction sites throughout the United States. When deemed necessary, we recondition used vehicles prior to sale in order to enhance the vehicle values at auction. Additionally, vehicles to be sold at public auctions may be relocated in accordance with our goal to minimize oversupply at any given location and maximize sales proceeds.


• | Recovery and Bankruptcy Center. The Recovery and Bankruptcy Center is responsible for collecting the deficiency balances of charged-off accounts using outside collection agencies, locating and securing the collateral of charged-off accounts, and collecting lease end of term fees. Consumer financing contracts are transferred from our regional offices to the Recovery and Bankruptcy Center after charge-off, which occurs when they become 120 days contractually past due, payments due are no longer expected to be received, or the underlying product is sold or has been held in unsold repossessed inventory for 90 days, whichever occurs first. In addition, accounts subject to bankruptcy proceedings are assigned to the Recovery and Bankruptcy Center for tracking, monitoring and handling through the life of the loan or until the related customer is discharged from bankruptcy. If the customer is discharged or dismissed from bankruptcy, the account will return to the original regional office for servicing.

In Canada, we have two regional offices that are responsible for acquisition, servicing, collection, and customer service activities related to our retail loans and leases. These offices are located in Quebec and Ontario. Similar to our United States operations, in addition to our servicing regions, we have centralized certain operational functions for our Canadian retail loans and leases. These centralized functions are located in Ontario and include our Customer Retention Centre, Recovery Centre, Collections Centre, Customer Service Centre, and Auctions/Remarketing Centre. The services provided by these centralized functions are comparable to the services provided by our National Service Center in the United States.
Recovery Policies and Procedures
We use an account servicing system and an automated dialer system that prioritize collection efforts, generate past due notices, and signal our collections personnel to make telephone contact with delinquent customers. For the purpose of determining whether a retail loan or lease is delinquent, payment is generally considered to have been made upon receipt of 90% of the sum of the current monthly payment due plus any overdue monthly payments.
If necessary, repossession action is taken using bonded and licensed repossession agencies. Subject to a state or provincial laws and recording, filing, and notice requirements, we are generally permitted by applicable state or provincial laws to repossess automobiles or motorcycles upon default by the related customer. We typically decide whether or not to repossess a vehicle when the account is 45 to 60 or more days past due, subject to the laws and regulations governing repossession in the state or province where the automobile or motorcycle is located.
Incentive Financing Programs for Retail Loans and Leases
A substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI in the United States and Canada, respectively. These programs offer promotional rates on retail loans and leases to purchasers and lessees of Honda and Acura products. AHM or HCI, as applicable, pay us subsidies that enable us to realize a market yield on any financing contract we indirectly finance under these programs. Market yield is based on, among other things, the credit quality of the customer and the length of the contract. Subsidy payments received on retail loans and leases are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the related contracts. The volume of incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI’s marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning and control, in which we do not participate. Therefore, we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.”
Honda Aviation Financing
Honda Aviation Finance Company LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AHFC, provides financing and account servicing for customers of Honda Aircraft Company LLC, a subsidiary of AHM, in the United States. Customers submit a credit application and if our underwriting policies and legal requirements are met, the retail loan is approved.
Dealer Financing
Wholesale Flooring Loans
We provide wholesale flooring loans to dealers of Honda and Acura automobiles and Honda motorcycles, power equipment, and marine engines through our Dealer Financial Services (DFS) business unit.
Wholesale flooring financing is available primarily through revolving lines of credit and may only be used by dealers to finance the purchase of inventory. AHFC will finance new automobiles and motorcycles up to 100% of the dealer invoice price and used automobiles and motorcycles up to 80% of the applicable market value determined in accordance with industry pricing guides in the United States. HCFI will finance new automobiles and motorcycles up to 100% of the dealer invoice price and used automobiles and motorcycles up to the current market value determined in accordance with industry pricing guides in Canada. Dealers pay a variable interest rate on wholesale flooring loans. Wholesale flooring loans must be prepaid at specified intervals and increments and generally must be paid in full upon the sale of the product. AHM and HCI sponsor incentive-financing programs in the United States and Canada, respectively, to Honda and Acura dealers approved for wholesale flooring loans.
4

In establishing a wholesale flooring loan, we conduct a comprehensive review of the dealership, including a review of its business operations and management, any credit reports, financial statements, tax returns, bank references, and/or other available historical credit information and a review of the personal financial statements of the dealership’s individual owner(s). This data is organized into an electronic scorecard which supports our determination of whether we will provide a wholesale flooring loan and, if so, the amount of the loan and the interest rate. Once a wholesale flooring loan has been approved, we maintain an ongoing review process of the dealerships we finance. We use a third party to perform random periodic on-site physical inspections of financed dealership inventory at a frequency determined by the dealership’s scorecard and financial performance. Monitoring activities are performed more frequently for dealerships with higher levels of credit risk.
We seek to retain a purchase money security interest in all products that are financed pursuant to wholesale flooring loan agreements we enter into with dealers. In addition, we generally secure wholesale flooring loans with liens on the dealership’s other assets and obtain a personal guarantee from dealership owners, as well as corporate guarantees from, or on behalf of, dealership owner(s)’ other dealerships. Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements. We require dealerships to maintain insurance on all inventory, including peril coverage for flood, hail, wind, false pretense, liability, earthquake, vandalism, and other risks.
In the event of a default on a wholesale flooring loan, we may repossess the financed product, sell the repossessed assets, and seek other available legal remedies pursuant to the related wholesale flooring loan agreement and related guarantees consistent with commercially accepted practices and applicable laws. After the sale of a financed product to consumers in the ordinary course of business, we have no right to recover the product and are limited to the remedies under our wholesale flooring loan agreement with the dealer. Additionally, we have agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase of new, unused, undamaged, and unregistered vehicle or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.
A wholesale flooring loan is considered delinquent when any payment is contractually past due. Collection efforts are initiated using our staff. We file replevin actions, send past due notices, enter into forbearance agreements, and renegotiate contracts with delinquent dealers. If we determine a dealer cannot meet the obligations under its wholesale flooring loan agreement, legal action may commence. Subject to recording, filing and notice requirements of state, provincial or other laws we are generally permitted by the applicable laws to repossess the underlying collateral that have not been sold to a buyer in the ordinary course of business.
In the United States, wholesale flooring loans are serviced at AHFC’s regional offices in California, Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois, North Carolina, Delaware, and Georgia. In Canada, wholesale flooring loans are serviced at HCFI’s headquarters in Ontario.
Commercial Loans
We provide commercial loans to Honda and Acura automobile dealers through our DFS business unit. This commercial financing is available primarily through term loans and are used primarily for financing dealership property, equipment, construction, facility improvements, and working capital. Dealers generally pay a variable interest rate on commercial loans in the United States. In Canada, dealers pay both fixed rates and variable rates on commercial loans.
In establishing a commercial loan, we conduct a comprehensive review of the dealership, including a review of its business operations and management, appraisals of dealership property, credit reports, financial statements, tax returns, bank references, and/or other available historical credit information and a review of the personal financial statements of the dealership’s individual owner(s). Once the loan has been approved, we maintain an ongoing review process of the dealership we finance, which we believe is consistent with industry practices.
Commercial loans are generally secured by the associated properties, inventory, and other dealership assets. In addition, we generally obtain a personal guarantee from dealership owners, as well as corporate guarantees from, or on behalf of, dealership individual owner(s)’ other dealerships. Although our commercial loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure. Commercial loans are considered delinquent when any payment is contractually past due.
In the United States, commercial loans are serviced at AHFC’s headquarters in California. In Canada, commercial loans are serviced at HCFI’s headquarters in Ontario.

Competition
The automobile financing industries in the United States and Canada are very competitive. Providers of vehicle and similar product financing have traditionally competed based on interest rates charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered, the quality of service provided to dealers and customers, and the strength of dealer relationships.
National and regional commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, finance companies, and other captive finance companies provide consumer financing for new and used Honda and Acura products. Commercial banks, finance companies, and captive finance companies of other manufacturers also provide inventory financing for Honda and Acura dealers. Our primary competition in the wholesale motorcycle, power equipment, and marine engine financing business tends to be local banks and specialty finance firms that are familiar with the particular characteristics of these businesses. In Canada, commercial banks are strong competitors in the automobile consumer financing business.
Relationships with HMC and Other Affiliates
The following is a description of certain relationships with HMC and other affiliates.
HMC and AHFC Keep Well Agreement
HMC and AHFC are parties to a keep well agreement (the HMC-AHFC Agreement), which became effective on September 9, 2005.
Under the terms of the HMC-AHFC Agreement, HMC has agreed to:

• | own and hold, at all times, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of AHFC’s issued and outstanding shares of voting stock and not pledge, directly or indirectly, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any such shares or permit any of HMC’s subsidiaries to do so, except to HMC or wholly-owned subsidiaries of HMC;


• | cause AHFC to, on the last day of each of AHFC’s fiscal years, have a positive consolidated tangible net worth (with “tangible net worth” for purposes of this discussion of the HMC-AHFC Agreement understood to mean (a) shareholders’ equity less (b) any intangible assets, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)); and


• | ensure that, at all times, AHFC has sufficient liquidity and funds to meet its payment obligations under any Debt (with “Debt” for purposes of this discussion of the HMC-AHFC Agreement defined as AHFC’s debt for borrowed money that HMC has confirmed in writing is covered by the HMC-AHFC Agreement) in accordance with the terms of such Debt, or where necessary, HMC will make available to AHFC, or HMC will procure for AHFC, sufficient funds to enable AHFC to pay its Debt in accordance with its terms.

The HMC-AHFC Agreement is not a guarantee by HMC of any Debt or other obligation, indebtedness, or liability of any kind of AHFC.
The HMC-AHFC Agreement includes AHFC’s agreement that it will use any funds made available to it by HMC thereunder solely for fulfilling AHFC’s payment obligations in respect of Debt. Any claims of HMC arising from any provisions of funds to AHFC by HMC shall be subordinated to the claims of all holders of Debt with respect to such Debt, whether or not such claims exist at the time such funds are made available to AHFC, and HMC will not demand payment of such claims from AHFC unless and until all outstanding Debt has been paid in full.
HMC or AHFC may each terminate the HMC-AHFC Agreement upon giving to the other party 30 days’ prior written notice and the HMC-AHFC Agreement may be modified or amended only by the written agreement of HMC and AHFC and upon 30 days’ prior written notice to each rating agency rating any covered Debt. However, such termination, modification, or amendment will not be effective with respect to any Debt outstanding at the time of such termination, modification, or amendment unless: (i) such termination, modification, or amendment is permitted under the documentation governing such Debt, (ii) all affected holders of such Debt (or, in the case of Debt incurred pursuant to documentation that permits the HMC-AHFC Agreement to be terminated, modified, or amended with the consent of less than all of the holders of such Debt, the requisite holders of such Debt) otherwise consent in writing, or (iii) with respect to Debt that is rated by one or more rating agencies at the request of HMC or AHFC, each such rating agency confirms in writing that the rating assigned to such Debt will not be withdrawn or reduced because of the proposed action.
6

An amendment, modification, or termination of the HMC-AHFC Agreement (except as permitted by its terms) would constitute an event of default under certain of AHFC’s Debt and failure by HMC to meet its obligations under the HMC-AHFC Agreement would constitute an event of default under such Debt if the failure continued for 30 days and was continuing at the time the default was declared.
Under its terms, the HMC-AHFC Agreement is not enforceable against HMC by anyone other than: (i) AHFC or (ii) if any case is commenced under the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 USC §§101 et seq.), or any successor statutory provisions, or the Bankruptcy Code, in respect of AHFC, the debtor in possession or trustee appointed by the court having jurisdiction over such proceeding. In the event of (1) a breach by HMC in performing a provision of the HMC-AHFC Agreement and (2) the commencement of such a case under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of AHFC while any Debt is outstanding, the remedies of a holder of Debt shall include the right, if no proceeding in respect of AHFC has already been commenced in such case, to file a petition in respect of AHFC thereunder with a view to the debtor in possession, or the trustee appointed by the court having jurisdiction over such proceeding, pursuing AHFC’s rights under the HMC-AHFC Agreement against HMC. However, all holders of outstanding Debt may (i) demand in writing that AHFC enforce its rights under the HMC-AHFC Agreement and (ii) proceed directly against HMC to enforce compliance by HMC with its obligations under the HMC-AHFC Agreement if AHFC fails or refuses to take action to enforce its rights under that agreement within 30 days following AHFC’s receipt of demand for such enforcement by such holder.
The HMC-AHFC Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
HMC and HCFI Keep Well Agreement
HMC and HCFI are parties to a Keep Well Agreement (the HMC-HCFI Agreement), which became effective on September 26, 2005.
Under the terms of the HMC-HCFI Agreement, HMC has agreed to:

• | own and hold, at all times, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of HCFI’s issued and outstanding shares of voting stock and not pledge, directly or indirectly, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any such shares or permit any of HMC’s subsidiaries to do so, except to HMC or wholly-owned subsidiaries of HMC;


• | cause HCFI to, on the last day of each of HCFI’s fiscal years, have a positive consolidated tangible net worth (with “tangible net worth” for purposes of this discussion of the HMC-HCFI Agreement understood to mean (a) shareholders’ equity less (b) any intangible assets, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada); and


• | ensure that, at all times, HCFI has sufficient liquidity and funds to meet its payment obligations under any Debt (with “Debt” for purposes of this discussion of the HMC-HCFI Agreement defined as HCFI’s debt for borrowed money that HMC has confirmed in writing is covered by the HMC-HCFI Agreement) in accordance with the terms of such Debt, or where necessary, HMC will make available to HCFI, or HMC will procure for HCFI, sufficient funds to enable HCFI to pay its Debt in accordance with its terms.

The HMC-HCFI Agreement is not a guarantee by HMC of any Debt or other obligation, indebtedness, or liability of any kind of HCFI.
The HMC-HCFI Agreement includes HCFI’s agreement that it will use any funds made available to it by HMC thereunder solely for the purposes of fulfilling HCFI’s payment obligations in respect of Debt. Any claims of HMC arising from any provisions of funds to HCFI by HMC shall be subordinated to the claims of all holders of Debt with respect to such Debt, whether or not such claims exist at the time such funds are made available to HCFI, and HMC will not demand payment of such claims from HCFI unless and until all outstanding Debt has been paid in full.
7

HMC or HCFI may each terminate the HMC-HCFI Agreement upon giving to the other party 30 days’ prior written notice and the HMC-HCFI Agreement may be modified or amended only by the written agreement of HMC and HCFI and upon 30 days’ prior written notice to each rating agency rating any covered Debt. However, such termination, modification, or amendment will not be effective with respect to any Debt outstanding at the time of such termination, modification, or amendment unless: (i) such termination, modification, or amendment is permitted under the documentation governing such Debt, (ii) all affected holders of such Debt (or, in the case of Debt incurred pursuant to documentation that permits the HMC-HCFI Agreement to be terminated, modified, or amended with the consent of less than all of the holders of such Debt, the requisite holders of such Debt) otherwise consent in writing, or (iii) with respect to Debt that is rated by one or more rating agencies at the request of HMC or HCFI, each such rating agency confirms in writing that the rating assigned to such Debt will not be withdrawn or reduced because of the proposed action.
An amendment, modification, or termination of the HMC-HCFI Agreement (except as permitted by its terms) would constitute an event of default under certain of HCFI’s Debt and failure by HMC to meet its obligations under the HMC-HCFI Agreement would constitute an event of default under such Debt if the failure continued for 30 days and was continuing at the time the default was declared.
Under its terms, the HMC-HCFI Agreement is not enforceable against HMC by anyone other than: (i) HCFI or (ii) if any case is commenced under the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Canadian Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, or the Canadian Winding Up and Restructuring Act by or against HCFI, the debtor in possession or trustee or receiver appointed by the court having jurisdiction over such proceeding. In the event of (1) a breach by HMC in performing a provision of the HMC-HCFI Agreement and (2) the insolvency of HCFI while any Debt is outstanding, the remedies of a holder of Debt shall include the right, if no proceeding in respect of HCFI has already been commenced in such proceeding, to file an application in respect of HCFI for the appointment of a trustee or receiver by the court having jurisdiction over such proceeding in order to pursue HFCI’s rights under the HMC-HCFI Agreement against HMC. However, all holders of outstanding Debt may (i) demand in writing that HCFI enforce its rights under the HMC-HCFI Agreement and (ii) proceed directly against HMC to enforce compliance by HMC with its obligations under the HMC-HCFI Agreement if HCFI fails or refuses to take action to enforce its rights under that agreement within 30 days following HCFI’s receipt of demand for such enforcement by such holder.
The HMC-HCFI Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Incentive Financing Programs
AHM and HCI sponsor incentive-financing programs in the United States and Canada, respectively. These programs offer promotional rates on loans and leases to purchasers, lessees, and dealers of Honda and Acura products. AHM or HCI, as applicable, pay us subsidies that enable us to realize a market yield on any financing contract we indirectly or directly finance under these programs. These subsidy payments supplement the revenues on our financing products offered under our incentive financing programs. See “—Consumer Financing—Incentive Financing Programs for Retail Loans and Leases” above for more information.
Related Party Debt
HCFI issues fixed rate short-term notes to HCI to fund HCFI’s general corporate operations. See Note 4—Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our related party debt.
Vehicle Service Contract Administration
Our Consumer Assurance Products and Service Group is responsible for the administration of vehicle service contracts issued by AHM, American Honda Protection Products Corporation (AHPPC) and American Honda Service Contracts Corporation (AHSCC), wholly-owned subsidiaries of AHM. HCFI performs marketing services for vehicle service contracts issued by HCI. We receive fees to perform administrative and marketing services for AHM, AHPPC, AHSCC or HCI, as applicable.
A vehicle service contract is a contractual agreement between the dealer, manufacturer or an independent third party, and the dealer’s customer. The contract provides for certain repairs, mechanical breakdown coverage, roadside assistance, and/or oil changes for the customer’s new or used automobile. A vehicle service contract can be obtained on both Honda and Acura automobiles.
As the administrator, we approve claims and provide customer service to purchasers of vehicle service contracts. We do not provide the maintenance or roadside assistance provided by the vehicle service contracts.

Shared Services
Honda North America, Inc. (HNA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HMC, provides services to Honda’s North American operations. HNA provides us with information technology, legal, internal audit, and other services pursuant to a shared services agreement. HNA is paid a compensation fee for these services.
In Canada, we also share certain common expenditures with HCI, including professional services, data processing services, insurance policies, software development and facilities.
Benefit Plans
Our employees participate in various employee benefit plans that are sponsored by AHM and HCI, respectively. Refer to Note 8—Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about employee benefit plans.
Income taxes
AHFC and its United States subsidiaries are included in the consolidated United States federal income tax returns of AHM and many consolidated or combined state and local income tax returns of AHM. In some cases AHFC and its United States subsidiaries file tax returns separately as required by certain state and local jurisdictions. AHFC and its United States subsidiaries pay for their share of the consolidated or combined income tax on a modified separate return basis pursuant to an intercompany tax allocation agreement with AHM. AHFC and its applicable United States subsidiaries file a separate California return based on California’s worldwide income and apportionment rules. To the extent AHFC and its United States subsidiaries have taxable losses in AHM’s consolidated federal and consolidated or combined state and local tax returns, AHM reimburses AHFC and its United States subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent the losses are utilized by AHM or another member of the consolidated or combined group under the terms of the intercompany tax allocation agreement. All but an insignificant amount of the federal and state taxes payable or receivable shown on the consolidated balance sheets are due to or from AHM, pursuant to the intercompany tax allocation agreement.
Our Canadian subsidiary, HCFI, files Canadian federal and provincial income tax returns based on the separate legal entity financial statements. HCFI does not file federal, state or local income tax returns in the United States.

Repurchase Agreements
We have agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase of new, unused, undamaged, and unregistered vehicles or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.
Seasonality
We are subject to seasonal variations in credit losses, which are historically higher in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. This seasonality does not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
Employee Relations
At March 31, 2019, we had 1,497 employees. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
Governmental Regulations
Our consumer financing and dealer financing operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under various United States, Canadian, state, provincial, and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In recent years, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry and consumer financing in particular. As a result, there have been and may continue to be proposals for laws and regulations that could increase the scope and nature of laws and regulations that are currently applicable to us. We actively monitor proposed changes to relevant legal and regulatory requirements in order to maintain our compliance. The cost of our ongoing compliance efforts in our consumer financing and dealer financing operations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition to date, although future compliance efforts may have such an effect.

United States
Our consumer financing operations in the United States are regulated under both federal and state laws, including consumer protection statutes and related regulations. Management believes that AHFC is in compliance in all material respects, with the applicable federal and state laws, including consumer protection statutes and related regulations.
Federal Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal regulation, including the regulations discussed below. These laws, in part, require us to provide certain disclosures prior to and throughout the duration of consumer retail and lease financing transactions and prohibit certain credit and collection practices.

• | The Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act place disclosure and substantive transaction restrictions on consumer credit and leasing transactions.


• | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act is designed to prevent discrimination based on certain protected classes in any aspect of a credit transaction, requires the distribution of specified credit decision notices and limits the information that may be requested and considered in a credit transaction.


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes restrictions and requirements regarding our use and sharing of credit reports, the reporting of data to credit reporting agencies, credit decision notices, the accuracy and integrity of information reported to the credit reporting agencies, consumer dispute handling procedures, and identity theft prevention requirements.


• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires certain communications periodically with consumers on privacy matters, restricts the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers by financial institutions and prohibits the sharing of account number information for certain marketing purposes.


• | The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is federal legislation that provides special protection to certain customers in military service and is designed to protect military personnel from personal hardship or loss resulting from financial obligations while in service.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was enacted in 2010, has broad implications for the financial services industries, including automotive financing, securitizations and derivatives, and requires the development, adoption, and implementation of many regulations which will impact the offering, marketing, and regulation of consumer financial products and services offered by financial institutions. Agencies have issued rules establishing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives, providing for the regulation of non-bank financial institutions that pose systemic risk, and requiring sponsors of asset-backed securities to retain an ownership stake in securitization transactions. Although we have analyzed these and other rulemakings, the absence of final rules in some cases and the complexity of some of the proposed rules make it difficult for us to estimate the financial, compliance and operational impacts.
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad rule-making, examination and enforcement authority with respect to the laws and regulations that apply to consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, including those entities that are larger participants of a market for consumer financial products or services, as defined by rule. We are subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection laws.
State Regulation
We are also subject to laws and regulations that vary among the states. A majority of states have enacted legislation establishing licensing requirements to conduct consumer-financing activities. We are also periodically subject to state audits and inquiries, which monitor our compliance with consumer and other regulations.
State rules and regulations generally include requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and limitations on the maximum rate of consumer finance charges, including interest rate. In periods of high interest rates, interest rate limitations could have an adverse effect on our operations if we are unable to pass on our increased costs to our customers or dealers. State rules and regulations also restrict collection practices and creditor’s rights regarding our consumer accounts.
