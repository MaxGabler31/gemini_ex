Description of the Business
We are a leading provider of sensors for navigation in the aerospace and defense market as well as a manufacturer of chips, laser components, and optical subsystems for use in the Broadband and Cable TV (“CATV”) industries. We pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of CATV directly on fiber, and today are a leading provider of advanced mixed-signal products serving the aerospace and defense and broadband communications markets. The mixed-signal technology, at the heart of our broadband communications products, is shared with our fiber optic gyroscopes (“FOGs”) and other inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigation systems technology. 
Over the last three years, EMCORE has expanded its scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“S&N”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business of KVH Industries, Inc. (“EMCORE Chicago”) in August 2022. 
We have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL. These facilities support our vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy for quartz, FOG, and Ring Laser Gyro (“RLG”) products for navigation systems, and for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications. We design and manufacture industry-leading QMEMS, lithium niobate, and InP chip-level technology to deliver state-of-the-art component and system-level products across our end-market applications. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of applications including navigation and inertial sensing, defense optoelectronics, broadband communications, optical sensing, and specialty chips for telecom and data center applications.
We utilize metal organic chemical vapor deposition systems capable of processing a wide range of compound semiconductor-based materials. Operations include wafer fabrication, device design and production, fiber optic module, subsystem, and system design and manufacture, and Quartz MEMS (“QMEMS”) gyroscope, accelerometer, and inertial measurement units (“IMU”) and inertial navigation systems (“INS”) design and manufacture. Operations in our Broadband segment beyond wafer fabrication are already largely and increasingly manufactured with our electronics manufacturing service providers and other contract manufacturers (collectively, “CMs”). We are vertically integrated in the manufacture of FOGs, QMEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, IMU and INS within our own facilities. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. Our CMs also maintain comprehensive quality assurance and delivery systems that are monitored for compliance.
