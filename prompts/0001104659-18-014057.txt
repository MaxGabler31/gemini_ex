ITEM 1.                                        BUSINESS
 
When this report uses the words the Company, we, us and our, these words refer to Monster Beverage Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Based in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business, except through its consolidated subsidiaries. The Companys subsidiaries primarily develop and market energy drinks as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks.
 
Reportable Segments
 
We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (Monster Energy® Drinks), which is comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Hydro® energy drinks and Mutant® Super Soda drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (Strategic Brands), which is comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) in 2015 (the TCCC Transaction) (see Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) and (iii) Other segment (Other), the principal products of which include the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (effectively from January 1, 2015 to June 12, 2015), as well as certain products, acquired as part of our American Fruits & Flavors (AFF) asset acquisition in 2016 (the AFF Transaction) (see Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements), that are sold by AFF to independent third-party customers (the AFF Third-Party Products) (effectively from April 1, 2016). Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not specifically relate to a reportable segment have been allocated to Corporate and Unallocated. Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 90.5%, 90.5% and 92.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 8.9%, 8.9%, 5.3% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015). Our Other segment represented 0.6%, 0.6% and 2.2% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases, we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, food service customers and the military.
 
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling concentrates and/or beverage bases to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers, drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.
 
Generally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margins than the Strategic Brands segment.

Industry Overview
 
The alternative beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with new age beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2017 for the alternative beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $52.6 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5.6% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2016 of approximately $49.8 billion.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
On April 1, 2016, we completed the AFF Transaction resulting in our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF, in an asset acquisition that brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, we purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments. (See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).
 
On June 12, 2015, we completed the TCCC Transaction contemplated by the definitive agreements entered into with TCCC on August 14, 2014, which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category. (See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Corporate History
 
In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. This business eventually became Hansens Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known as The Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. (FJC).  FJC retained the right to market and sell fresh non-pasteurized juices under the Hansens® trademark. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (HFI). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansens Natural Soda® brand sodas. In 1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (CCC) acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansens® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural Corporation acquired the Hansens® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansens® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the growing alternative beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 1999, we acquired all of FJCs rights to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice products under the Hansens® trademark together with certain additional rights. In 2012, we changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, as part of the TCCC Transaction, we acquired the Strategic Brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF.

Other Products
 
We continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional products, flavors and types of beverages to complement our existing product lines. We may also evaluate, and where considered appropriate, introduce additional types of consumer products we consider are complementary to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able to add value. Under the terms of the TCCC Transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with TCCC in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, other than the energy drink category.
Products  Packaging
 
Our products are packaged in a variety of different package types and sizes including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends as well as glass bottles, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles and PET plastic cans.
Manufacture and Distribution
 
We do not directly manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and contract packers.
 
The AFF Transaction brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. We also source flavors from other suppliers.
 
We purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
 
8



For our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors. The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products, including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain limited products in the Strategic Brands segment, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, flavors, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our Strategic Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
 
Co-Packing Arrangements
 
All of our finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. The majority of our co-packaging arrangements are generally on a month-to-month basis or are terminable upon request and do not generally obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within specified periods.
 
In some instances, subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us and/or jointly with our co-packers, and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our products. In certain cases, such equipment remains our property and is returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-packer at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are produced at the facilities concerned.
 
For our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage products are packaged.
 
Our products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally, which enables us to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold, with the objective of reducing freight costs as well as transportation-related product damages. As distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source additional packing arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs.
 
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, PET plastic cans, glass bottles, labels, flavors, juice concentrates, dietary ingredients, other ingredients and certain sweeteners, and/or procure adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. In this regard, due to a shortage in available retort capacity, we were unable to fulfill demand in full for our Java Monster and Muscle Monster products during the latter half of 2016 and into the fourth quarter of 2017. (See Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors).
 
9



Our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request. For certain of our products, including our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, our Java Monster® product line, our Espresso MonsterTM product line, our Monster Hydro® product line, our Muscle Monster® product line, our Punch Monster® product line and certain of our other products, there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all, a lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues.
 
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world (including in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the Middle East and the United States) with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the risk of a disruption in production and/or importation.
 
Distribution Agreements
 
During 2017, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and international markets, due in part to the TCCC Transaction.
 
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Gross sales outside the United States were $1,094.8 million, $888.7 million and $713.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Monster Energy® Distribution Agreements
 
We have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution of our products during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be renewed thereafter for additional terms ranging from one to five years.  Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party, which may include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement, termination upon: mutual agreement; material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either party; deadlock; change of control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements.  Additionally, we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon payment of a termination fee, including the distribution agreements with select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the AB Distributors) and a limited number of distribution agreements with TCCC network bottlers that were entered into prior to 2015.
 
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, as amended from time to time, are described below:
 
(a)                   Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCCs approval, territories in Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCCs network of wholly or partially-owned and independent bottlers will distribute and sell, or continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.
 
(b)                  Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Coca-Cola Refreshments (CCR), pursuant to which CCR distributes, directly and through certain sub-distributors, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in a large portion of the United States. As of March 1, 2018, all of the territory previously falling under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with CCR has been assigned by CCR to various TCCC network bottlers in the United States, including CCBCC Operations, LLC.
 
10



(c)                   Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCCs approval.
 
(d)                  Additionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy® products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.
 
Strategic Brands Distribution Agreements
 
On June 12, 2015, in connection with the closing of the TCCC Transaction, TCCC transferred to the Company all of its rights in and to TCCCs worldwide energy drink business including: NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Play®, Power Play(stylized)®, Relentless®, Nalu® and other brands (the Strategic Brands).
 
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCCs approval, territories in which TCCC network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
 
We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally, providing for the distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, PET plastic cans, glass bottles as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations.
 
The AFF Transaction brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities. We also purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, dietary ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose, other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
 
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad. As part of the TCCC Transaction, we acquired ownership of the TCCC flavor formulas for the Strategic Brands, with some limited exceptions.
 
With regard to our Java Monster®, Espresso MonsterTM and Muscle Monster® product lines, the dairy, protein and retort co-packing industries are subject to shortages and increased demand from time to time, which may result in production disruption and/or higher prices.
 
11



For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third party customers. We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-based products, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.
 
We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as negotiate arrangements with suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers, manufacturers and/or distributors.
 
Competition
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
 
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image, taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We also rely on our distributors to allocate more attention to our products than those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the alternative, energy, coffee and functional beverage categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, coffees, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in larger volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles (including Bai, Sobe Life Water, BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, CORE, Snapple, Arizona, Fuse, Ocean Spray, Honest Tea, Gold Peak Tea) and 12- and 16-ounce cans (such as Mountain Dew Kickstart), have added dietary supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of dietary ingredients, principally deliver refreshment and are positioned differently from our energy or functional drinks.
 
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues particularly in relation to the registration and taxation of our products in certain new international markets, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. (See Government Regulation below for additional information).
 
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing and sales efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo), The Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the DPS Group) and Red Bull Gmbh. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, sports personality endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports, causes and events. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands.
 
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
 
Where appropriate, we partner with our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers to assist our marketing efforts.
 
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 22.6% in 2017 compared to 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we employed 2,114 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 1,319 were employed on a full-time basis.

Customers
 
Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery, drug and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors sales to their own customers.

 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
-------------------------------------------------+------+------+-----
U.S. full service bottlers/distributors | 63% | 65% | 65% 
International full service bottlers/distributors | 28% | 25% | 23% 
Club stores and mass merchandisers | 7% | 8% | 9% 
Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers | 1% | 1% | 2% 
Other | 1% | 1% | 1% 

 
Our customers include CCR, Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Company, Coca-Cola Bottling Company, CCBCC Operations, LLC, United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC, Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, Great Lakes Coca-Cola Bottling, Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages LLC, Coca-Cola of Northern New England, Swire Coca-Cola, USA, Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages and certain other TCCC independent bottlers (collectively the TCCC North American Bottlers), Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola group in China, COFCO Coca-Cola group in China, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, Coca-Cola İçecek, Asahi Soft Drinks, Co., Ltd., Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sams Club), Costco Wholesale Corporation, Big Geyser, Inc. and select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the AB Distributors). TCCC, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the TCCC Subsidiaries), accounted for approximately 18%, 41% and 43% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As part of TCCCs North America Refranchising initiative (the North America Refranchising), the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent/non wholly-owned TCCC bottler/distributors. Accordingly, our percentage of net sales classified as sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017. CCBCC Operations, LLC accounted for approximately 13%, 9% and 6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. We believe that the volume of sales in the beverage industry are affected by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where temperature fluctuations may be more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.

Intellectual Property
 
We presently have more than 8,900 registered trademarks and pending applications in various countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to our business. We consider Monster® (registered outside of the United States in certain jurisdictions), Monster Energy®,®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Mutant®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Hydro®, Espresso MonsterTM, Caffé MonsterTM, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play(stylized)®, Relentless® and BPM® to be our core trademarks. In addition, as a result of the AFF Transaction, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity.
 
BU®, Nalu®, Burn®, Mother®, Play®, Power Play(stylized)®, Relentless®, Ultra Energy® and BPM® are registered outside of the United States in certain jurisdictions.
 
We protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the world, particularly where our products are distributed and sold.  We assert copyright ownership of the statements, graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing materials.  We aggressively pursue individuals and/or entities seeking to profit from the unauthorized use of our trademarks and copyrights, including, without limitation, wholesalers, street vendors, retailers, online auction site sellers and website operators. In addition to initiating civil actions against these individuals and entities, we work with law enforcement officials where appropriate.
 
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.
 
We also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging our trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.
 
Government Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; California Proposition 65 and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
 
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations below for additional information.
 
Furthermore, legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal, state and municipal level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below.  Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages, as discussed below.

Product Formulation, Labeling and Advertising. Globally, we are subject to a number of regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling and advertising of our Products. In California, we are subject to Proposition 65, a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a safe harbor threshold that may be established by the state, or the substance is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking, or is subject to another applicable exception. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere.
 
In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) revised regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including a new requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. Although these changes were scheduled to go into effect on July 26, 2018, the FDA has proposed delaying the compliance date until January 1, 2020 and has stated that it will not enforce the July 2018 compliance date. We may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with this and other new regulations. Additionally, the new regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.
 
Further, the City of San Francisco enacted an ordinance that would require health warnings on advertisements for certain sugar-sweetened beverages, though enforcement has been delayed due to a lawsuit challenging the ordinance.
 
In July 2012, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General for the State of New York in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what effect, if any, it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Other countries, such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Yemen, as well as Colombia, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic, are also considering new labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning statements.
 
Age and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products. Proposals to limit or restrict the sale and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold, and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, Latvia, Lithuania and Turkey prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18; Canada prohibits the promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Latvia and Scotland prohibit the sale of energy drinks in educational establishments; and Turkey prohibits the sale or advertising of energy drinks in collective consumption areas. Latin American countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Brazil are considering age and other sales restrictions on energy drinks.

Excise Taxes on Energy Drinks. Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages has been proposed in Congress, in some state legislatures, and by some local governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened beverage.  Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of $0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1, 2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder, Colorado; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Seattle, Washington) have passed similar measures, some of which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make certain of our products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign countries where we do business, such as France and Mexico. Similar measures have been enacted but are not yet enforced in, for example, Ireland, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Other countries, including Brazil, are considering similar measures. In addition, legislation has been proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes on energy drinks. For example, Estonia and Ukraine are considering proposals that would impose an excise tax on energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017, and there are indications that similar measures may be enacted in other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
 
Limits on Caffeine Content.  Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example, on January 1, 2013, new requirements took effect in Canada that limited the amount of caffeine contained in any beverage in a single-serving can or bottle to less than 180 milligrams, and imposed limits on the concentration levels for caffeine. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold in Canada to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients have also been implemented or proposed in other jurisdictions, including Turkey, India and Pakistans Punjab region. Such restrictions could require reformulations of certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.
 
Limitations on Container Size. We package our products in a variety of different package types and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than 16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Yemen, as well as Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic, are considering container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages which may require us to change the size of our products sold in these countries.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 
Container Deposits. Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been, and may in the future be, introduced in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and in certain foreign countries.
 
In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
