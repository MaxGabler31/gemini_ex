Our customers include some of the largest natural gas processors, transmission and distribution companies, refineries, power generators, industrial manufacturing, engineering and construction companies, semiconductor manufacturers, compressor manufacturers, beverage can manufacturers, metals and minerals, and electric vehicle producers in the world.
We believe our value differentiators include, but are not limited to, our product quality, reliability, on-time delivery and safety, supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence. We believe these are critical in maintaining our competitive position and have adopted a spirit of continuous improvement to ensure we maintain our market leadership position.
Industry Overview
 We serve a growing $5 billion dollar global market that is highly fragmented and serves various end markets including power generation, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas, electric vehicle production, poly silicon fabrication, battery recycling, and wastewater treatment, along with a wide range of other industries.
We believe demand for our products and services will continue to be driven by the following factors:
 •Global Focus on Environment. Increased demand for efficient solutions and reduced emissions for clean air and water remains at the forefront of sustainable production. As our customers and end markets navigate this changing landscape, we are making production cleaner, more efficient and flexible, and workplaces safer, using the same high manufacturing standards our customers expect. Increasingly, society, along with government regulation, call for corporations to commit to the preservation and protection of the environment. We believe that through our air and water quality and emissions control initiatives, companies want to work with us to protect people and our planet from the harmful effects of industrial processes. 
 •Global Economic Conditions. The Company’s businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Higher economic growth and other factors that would increase industrial gross domestic product and capital expenditures are projected to impact the markets the Company serves and could affect the Company’s businesses by increasing demand for the Company’s products and services. 
 •Worldwide Industrialization. Global trade has increased significantly over the last decade and is driven by growth in emerging markets, including China and India, as well as other developing nations in Asia and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) region. As a result of globalization, manufacturing that was historically performed domestically continues to migrate to lower cost countries. This movement of the manufacture of goods throughout the world increases demand for industrial ventilation products as new construction continues. We expect that more rigorous environmental regulations will be introduced to create a cleaner working environment and reduce environmental emissions as these economies evolve.
 •Natural Gas Infrastructure. The natural gas industry consists of the exploration, production, processing, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. The International Energy Association (“IEA”) projects a pronounced shift in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) countries away from oil and coal towards natural 


gas and renewables. Natural gas continues to be the fuel of choice for the electrical power and industrial sectors in many of the world’s regions, in part because of its lower carbon intensity compared with coal and oil, which makes it an attractive fuel source in countries where governments are implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 •Power Generation. Power generation encompasses a broad range of activities related to the production of electricity. The primary types of fossil fuels used to generate electricity are coal, natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear. In the United States, concerns about potential environmental regulations enhance the attractiveness of natural gas-fired power plants compared with coal-fired power plants, which generally have higher pollutant emission rates than natural gas-powered plants. Natural gas-fired power plants have lower initial capital needs and are more flexible in terms of operating times than coal plants. The transition to hydrogen and other clean fuels (such as liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and renewable natural gas) to generate power are in their infancy but will be part of the energy transition over the next decade. These fuels will require exhaust emissions control in the form of water and air quality solutions.
 •Refining, Oil Production and Petrochemical Processing. Refining, oil production and petrochemical processing involves the producing, refining and processing of fuels and chemicals for use in a variety of applications, such as gasoline, fertilizers and plastics. In response to increasing international demand for petrochemicals and refined products, companies are producing more products from new sources, constructing new refineries and petrochemical processing facilities as well as expanding existing facilities. In many cases, these new and expanded facilities must comply with stricter environmental regulations, which influence both choice of fuel and demand for systems to control exhaust emissions.
 •Stringent Regulatory Environment. The adoption of increasingly stringent environmental regulations globally requires businesses to pay strict attention to environmental protection. Businesses and industries of all types from refineries, power, chemical processes, metals and minerals, energy market and industrial manufacturing must comply with these various international, federal, state and local government regulations or potentially face substantial fines or be forced to suspend production or alter their production processes. These increasingly stringent environmental regulations are a principal factor that drives our business.
 These factors, individually or collectively, tend to cause increases in industrial capital spending that are not directly impacted by general economic conditions, expansion, or capacity increases. In contrast, favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and the construction of new industrial sites. However, in a weak economy, customers tend to lengthen the time from their initial inquiry to the purchase order or defer purchases.
 Mission and Strategy
 Our mission is to help companies grow their business with safe, clean and more efficient solutions that help protect people, our shared environment and industrial equipment.
We seek to fulfill this mission through established global leadership in air quality and water treatment solutions focused on serving a diversified set of niche markets around the world.

Our strategy to become the global leader in air quality and water treatment solutions is to drive an operating environment of performance excellence across the Company with a near term focus on targeted value creation enablers, and growth-oriented business segment performance.
 We constantly look for opportunities to gain new customers and penetrate geographic locations and end markets with existing products and services or acquire new product or service opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our customer base and end markets and have continued to pursue potential attractive growth opportunities both domestically and internationally. In the past few years, we have expanded our international presence with new sales & engineering hubs in the United Kingdom, Shanghai, Singapore, Pune India, and Dubai.
 Business Segments:
During the first quarter of 2021, management determined that a realignment of the Company's segments was necessary to better reflect the solutions we provide, and the end markets we serve. As a result of this realignment, we combined the operating results of the prior

Industrial Solutions segment and the Fluid Handling Solutions segment into a single reportable segment named the Industrial Process Solutions segment. Additionally, the Energy Solutions segment was renamed the Engineered Systems segment.
 Our reportable segments continue to be focused on attractive end markets and each segment is aligned to generate profitable growth for the Company with a compelling technology and solution set to benefit customers.
•Engineered Systems segment:  Our Engineered Systems segment, formerly known as the Energy Solutions segment, serves the power generation, refinery, water/wastewater and midstream oil & gas markets. We are a key part of helping meet the global demand for environmental and equipment protection through our highly engineered platforms including emissions management, fluid bed cyclones, thermal acoustics, separation & filtration, and dampers & expansion joints. 
 •Industrial Process Solutions segment: Our Industrial Process Solutions segment is the combination of the segments formerly known as our Industrial Solutions segment and our Fluid Handling Solutions segment, which serves the broad industrial air pollution control, beverage can, fluid handling, electric vehicle production, food and beverage, semi-conductor, process filtration, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, wastewater treatment, wood manufacturing, desalination, and aquaculture markets. We protect the air we collectively breathe, maintain clean and safe operations for employees, lower energy consumption, minimize waste for customers, and ensure they meet regulatory compliance standards for toxic emissions, fumes, volatile organic compounds and odors through our platforms including duct & installation, industrial air, and fluid handling. 
Competitive Strengths
 Leading market position as a complete solution provider. We believe we are a leading provider of critical solutions in industrial air quality and water treatment. The multi-billion dollar global market is highly fragmented with numerous small and regional contracting firms separately supplying engineering services, fabrication, installation, testing and monitoring, products and spare parts. We offer our customers a complete end-to-end solution, including engineering and project management services, procurement and fabrication, construction and installation, aftermarket support, and sale of consumables, which allows our customers to avoid dealing with multiple vendors when managing projects.

Our extensive experience and expertise in providing diversified solutions enhances our overall customer relationships, and provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets relative to other companies in the industry. We believe this is evidenced by strong relationships with many of our world-class customers. We believe no single competitor has the resources to offer a similar portfolio of product and service capabilities. We offer the depth of a large organization, while our lean organizational structure keeps us close to our customers and markets, allowing us to offer rapid and complete solutions in each unique situation.
 Global diversification and broad customer base. The global diversity of our operations and customer base provides us with multiple growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, we had a diversified customer base of approximately 6,500 active customers across a range of industries. We believe that the diversity of our customers and end markets mitigates our risk of a potential fluctuation or downturn in demand from any individual industry or particular customer. We believe we have the resources and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers as they upgrade and expand domestically as well as into new international markets. Once systems have been installed and a relationship has been established with the customer, we are often awarded repetitive service and maintenance business as the customers’ processes change and modifications or additions to their systems become necessary.
 Experienced management and engineering team. Our senior management team has substantial experience in industrial air quality and water treatment solutions. The business experience of our management team enables us to pursue our strategy. Our workforce includes approximately 250 engineers, designers, solution experts, and project managers whose significant specialized industry experience and technical expertise enables them to have a deep understanding of the solutions that will best suit the needs of our customers.

We leverage our engineering and manufacturing expertise and strong customer relationships to develop new customized products to address the identified needs of our customers or a particular end market. We thoroughly analyze new product opportunities by considering projected demand for the product or service, price point, and expected operating costs, and only pursue those opportunities that we believe will contribute to earnings growth in the near-term. In addition, we continually improve our traditional technologies and adapt them to new industries and processes.
 Disciplined acquisition program with successful integration. We believe that we have demonstrated an ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies with complementary product or service offerings. We will continue to seek and execute additional strategic

acquisitions and focus on expanding our product service and breadth, as well as entering into new adjacent markets. We believe that the breadth and diversity of our products and services and our ability to deliver full solutions to various end markets provides us with multiple sources of stable growth and a competitive advantage relative to other players in the industry.
 Products and Services
 We provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers and diverters, selective catalytic reduction and selective non-catalytic reduction systems, cyclonic technology, thermal oxidizers, filtration systems, scrubbers, water treatment and fluid handling equipment, and plant engineering services and engineered design build fabrication. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support and single source.
Project Design and Research and Development
 We start by understanding our customers’ needs and delivering better outcomes for them by focusing new product development efforts that help protect our shared environment while working to improve a variety of operational outcomes including, but not limited to, facility uptime, production quality, employee safety, equipment protection and process performance. We produce specialized products that are often tailored to the specifications of a customer or application.
We continually collaborate with our customers on their projects to develop the proper solution and ensure customer satisfaction. The project development cycle may follow many different paths depending on the specifics of the job and end market. The cycle can take from one to more than twelve months from concept and design to production but may vary significantly depending on developments that occur during the process, including among others, the emergence of new environmental demands, changes in design specifications and ability to obtain necessary approvals.
Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our global selling strategy is to provide a solutions-based approach by being a single source provider of technology products and services. The strategy involves expanding our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions and the formation and integration of new business units. We believe this strategy provides a discernible competitive advantage. We execute this strategy by utilizing our portfolio of in-house technologies and those of third-party equipment suppliers. Many of these have been long-standing relationships, which have evolved from pure supplier roles to value-added business partnerships. This enables us to leverage existing business with selective alliances of suppliers and application specific engineering expertise. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support, and single source. Our value proposition to customers is to provide competitively priced, customized solutions. Our industry-specific knowledge, accompanied by our product and service offerings, provides valuable synergies for design innovation.
 We sell and market our products and services with our own direct sales force, including employees in the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates, India, China, and Singapore, in conjunction with outside sales representatives in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and India. We expect to continue expanding our sales and support capabilities and our network of outside sales representatives in key regions domestically and internationally.
 We market our offerings to our customers through a variety of channels including, but not limited to, digital, web, social media, email campaigns, individual customer visits, product announcements, brochures, magazine articles, advertisements and cover or article features in trade journals and other publications. We also participate in public relations and promotional events, including industry tradeshows and technical conferences.
Our customer service organization and sales force provides our customers with technical assistance, use and maintenance information as well as other key information regarding their purchase. We also actively provide our customers with access to key information regarding changes and pending changes in environmental regulations as well as new product or service developments. We believe that maintaining a close relationship with our customers and providing them with the support they request improves their level of satisfaction and enables us to foresee their potential future product needs or service demands. Moreover, this approach can lead to sales of annual service and support contracts as well as consumables. Our website also provides our customers with online tools and technical resources.
 Quality Assurance
 In engineered systems, quality is defined as system performance. We review with our customers, before the contract is signed, the technical specification and the efficiency of the equipment that will be customized to meet their specific needs. We then review these same parameters internally to assure that warranties will be met. Standard project management and production management tools are

used to help ensure that all work is done to specification and that project schedules are met. Equipment is tested at the site to ensure it is functioning properly.
Customers
 We are not dependent upon any single customer, and no customer comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for 2021.
 Suppliers and Subcontractors
 We purchase our raw materials and supplies from a variety of global sources. When possible, we directly secure angle iron and sheet plate products from steel mills, whereas other materials are purchased from a variety of steel service centers. Steel prices have traditionally been volatile, but we typically mitigate the risk of higher prices by including a “surcharge” on our standard products. On contract work, we try to mitigate the risk of higher prices by including the current price in our estimate and generally include price inflation clauses for protection.
Typically, on turnkey projects, we subcontract manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, controls, conveyors and insulation. We use subcontractors with whom we have good working relationships and review each project at the beginning and on an ongoing basis to help ensure that all work is being done according to our specifications. Subcontractors are generally paid when we are paid by our customers according to the terms of our contract with the customer. The Company’s asset-light business model focuses on effective management of subcontractors, which allows the Company to achieve targeted working capital levels through reduction in certain assets and reduced capital expenditures.
 While we believe we have a good relationship with our suppliers and subcontractors, we are currently experiencing shortages of raw materials and inflationary pressures for certain materials and labor. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future as markets recover. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Backlog
 Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog was $213.9 million as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $183.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.
Competition
 The markets we serve are highly fragmented with numerous small and regional participants. We believe no single company competes with us across the full range of our systems and products. Competition in the markets we serve is based on a number of considerations, including timeliness of delivery, technology, applications experience, know-how, reputation, product warranties, service and price. Demand for our product can vary period over period depending on conditions in the markets we serve. We believe our product quality, reliability, on-time delivery and safety supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence differentiate us from many of our competitors, including those competitors who often offer products at a lower price.
 Due to the size and shipping weight of many of our projects, localized manufacturing/fabrication capabilities are very important to our customers. As a result, competition varies widely by region and industry. The market for our engineered products is reasonably competitive and is characterized by technological change, continuously changing environmental regulations, and evolving customer requirements. We believe that the additional competitive factors in our markets include:
 •performance track record;
 •comprehensive portfolio of products with leading technology;
 •brand recognition;
 •high design standard;
 •quality and reliable solutions;


•on-time delivery;
 •quality customer service and support; and
 •financial and operational stability, including reputation.
 We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
 Government Regulations
We believe our operations are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations create opportunity given the nature of our business.
Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations. While there are not currently regulations proposed or pending that we believe will result in material capital, operating or other costs to the business at this time, such regulations could be proposed and/or passed into law in 2022 or beyond. Other regulations currently in place could be withdrawn and replaced with more stringent requirements in 2022 or beyond. New laws and regulations and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined through regulatory guidance and enforcement.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure/confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We sell most of our products under a number of registered trade names, brand names and registered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the industry. While we hold patents within a number of our businesses, we do not view our patents to be material to our business.
 Commitment to Values and Ethics
 
At CECO, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, data privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies ,including through an anonymous helpline. Our executive officers and managers maintain an “open door” policy, and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited.
 
Human Capital Management
 
CECO recognizes that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must identify, attract, retain and motivate world-class talent. As of December 31, 2021, CECO has approximately 730 employees, across eight countries. One-hundred and thirty of our US employees are unionized in our Pennsylvania, Tennessee and North Carolina facilities.
Talent, Leadership and People Development
 
To support personal and professional development, we have strategically committed resources to leadership and management development programs, product knowledge, job skills, and compliance training. In 2021, CECO continues to leverage a online learning platform so our employees can continue developing their skill sets and knowledge. Our learning platform offers over 16,000 courses and certifications ranging from job function to leadership and resource training. As of December 31, 2021, 82% of our employees have engaged with this learning platform and they are spending approximately 3 hours per month building their knowledge and skills. Additionally, in 2021 we further invested in high performing leaders by partnering with top US Universities including Wharton, Yale, MIT University of CA Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania and more, to build strategic, leadership and operational excellence skills. We also partnered with the Center of Creative Leadership to further reinforce leadership skills by investing in executive level coaching of high performing leaders. We believe this investment in our team members and leaders results in a more knowledgeable and competent workforce today while strengthening our succession plan and leadership bench for the future.
 
We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills to thrive in the workplace of the future. Strategic talent reviews are conducted annually across all business areas. The Board is updated on the Company’s people strategy on an annual basis, which is refined based on business drivers, market factors and key initiatives designed to drive the corporate strategy and business results and meets to review our succession planning strategy and leadership pipeline for key roles, taking into account the Company’s long-term strategy.


Health and Safety
 
At CECO, the health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities. We believe that all injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents are preventable, and we are committed to operating with a zero-incident culture. Through our environmental, health and safety program we implement policies and training programs, as well as perform self-audits to ensure our colleagues leave the workplace safely every day. To better understand employee safety at the site level, we have safety committees and safety scorecards to share best practices between sites. We currently share scorecard information monthly to foster visibility, accountability and commitment across our workplace, communicating and celebrating successful results across the enterprise. In addition to lagging indicators, such as injury performance, the scorecards highlight leading indicators such as safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at each site to ensure worker safety. For the year ended December 31, 2021, CECO’s domestic Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) was 1.9% as compared to our benchmark industry average TRIR of 4.1%.

Our safety focus is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. We implemented all government, federal and state policies, in addition to our enhanced policies procedures and protocols:
 
•implemented remote work and work from home flexibility for office job roles;
 •continued utilization of Microsoft Teams world-wide to enable collaboration while ensuring team safety;
 •continued to leverage an Emergency Paid Pandemic Leave policy to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
