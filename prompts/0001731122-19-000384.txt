ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Celexus, Inc. is an acquisition, management and holding company for early stage businesses and technologies in the hemp industry. Prior to the end of the fiscal year covered in this report, we entered into an agreement to acquire HempWave, Inc., which formerly operated as Bio Distribution, Inc. (“HempWave”). While that acquisition has not been finalized, we anticipate it will be completed in the coming months after we obtain an appraisal of HempWave.
Corporate History
 Celexus, Inc. is a Nevada incorporated corporation, originally organized on August 23, 2008. The company has been operating as Celexus, Inc. since October 2018. Prior to October 2018, the corporate entity operated under various names and business plans. Investors should only consider the company’s operations since October 2018 as relevant to the current business of the company. A detailed list of the corporate history of the company is available in our Form 10-Q filed on April 3, 2019 and available at: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355559/000173112219000162/e1260_form10q.htm. 
 Prior to October 2018, and within the past five years, the company was known as Telupay International, Inc., a development stage company focused on mobile banking and payment processing. Prior to this annual report, the last annual report filed for the company was submitted on July 17, 2014, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. On February 28, 2018, the company filed a Form 15 notice of termination of registration under section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company then undertook a change in majority ownership and business plan, reconstituting as Celexus, Inc., and on February 5, 2019 filing its Form 10 General Form for Registration of Securities pursuant to section 12(g) of the Securities Act of 1934.
 Business Overview
 
We are focused on the new opportunities available for the growth of hemp following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe that the changes in law resulting from this legislation allow for hemp cultivation and transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. We believe that the hemp industry is ready for significant growth as a result of hemp therapeutic uses and environmental benefits and feel that this is the right time to enter this industry.
 Some observers estimate that hemp biomass has over 50,000 uses including 100% biodegradable plastic, paper, clothing, building materials, etc. Additionally, cannabidiol (“CBD”) based medicines and supplements are believed to provide many medical benefits. In particular, it has been reported that CBD has demonstrated effectiveness in treating some forms of childhood epilepsy syndromes and reducing or eliminating seizures in some patients. Others believe that CBD can treat hundreds of medical issues such as anxiety, depression, pain, arthritis, insomnia, anorexia, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, several types of cancer, Alzheimer’s, and dementia, among other medical conditions. However, medical trials are still necessary for many of these conditions.
 Hemp production also provides environmental benefits compared to traditional agricultural or forestry products. For instance, in regards to biomass for methanol, paper production, and fiberboard for construction, the average grow cycle for hemp is 12-14 weeks to fully mature at 10-15 feet tall. In contrast, a tree can take 20-50 years to reach full maturity. We believe that growth of hemp could significantly reduce deforestation by providing the same products that trees are able to supply. Further, hemp is a more efficient carbon absorbent than trees, helping to improve air quality and reducing greenhouse gas accumulation.
 We expect that more uses will be realized following new research and development that has only recently become possible after the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill. 
 Our Objective
 Our objective is to control every aspect of the hemp farming industry from seeds, to cultivation, to extraction, and to distribution. Our goal is to become a leading supplier of both hemp seeds and clones internationally. We aim to do this by undertaking strategic acquisitions of companies that will be wholly-owned operating subsidiaries of Celexus, Inc. Our business plan includes three-stages for these acquisitions. We intend to acquire:

1. | Landholding entities for the cultivation of high grade, certified hemp seeds and clones. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Processing facilities to dry biomass, extract hemp oil and refine to pharmaceutical grade CBD oils. 
3. | Wholesale distribution services for domestic and international distribution of hemp products.

Seeds and Clones Products
 As part of stage one, we intend to acquire state law compliant entities that will be able to cultivate help and produce seeds and clones for other cultivators.
 Finding quality seeds in the current hemp market has proven difficult for many growers. Low quality seeds are suitable for biomass and products derived from hemp fiber, but higher quality seeds are necessary for higher-value CBD production. These higher quality seeds are typically bio-engineered and protected by patents. As a result, cultivators will need to repurchase seeds every grow cycle. A typical CBD hemp farm will grow between 1,500 to 2,500 plants per acre. This requires approximately 2,500 to 3,500 seeds per acre per growth cycle since all seeds will not germinate.
 Clones are clippings from another hemp plant that can be planted and grown into new plants. There are three main benefits to growing clones over seeds.
 
1. | Faster growth cycles because the plant is already several inches tall;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A clone copies the exact genetic makeup of the plant it was clipped from, reducing the risk of genetic issues; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Guaranteed plants in contrast to seed cultivation because some seeds do not sprout.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clones, however, are costlier per plant than seeds, which can reduce the demand for such products. With clones, there is also the risk that plants will carry over any disease or infection from the original plant. To mitigate this risk and to generate the highest quality product possible, we intend to grow out plants indoors and under constant supervision from our master growers.
 Initial Acquisition
 In February 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Bio Distribution, Inc., which recently has been renamed to HempWave. The acquisition price is $13,000,000 worth of our stock and $1. HempWave and Celexus, Inc. are under common control. However, we do not anticipate the acquisition will be completed until we receive a full appraisal of HempWave. The acquisition terms include a due diligence period through July 31, 2019. If we are not satisfied with the results of the due diligence, then no qcquisition will occur. We also note that the acquisition price could be increased if the appraisal determines that HempWave valuation is significantly higher than $13,000,000.
 HempWave has acquired a bio-engineered strain of hemp seeds that produce low Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) levels, to meet industry regulations, and a high CBD content, which is ideal for CBD products. HempWave will begin cultivation operations in two greenhouse facilities based in Phoenix and Willcox, Arizona, which have a combined total of over 210,000 square feet of arable land. The greenhouse facilities include agricultural lighting, drip systems, storage areas, and sufficient water rights.
 We believe HempWave is a suitable acquisition target. In addition to its current strains and growing space, HempWave has received all five industrial hemp licenses issued by the State of Arizona. The licenses include:
 
Nursery License —allows
the licensee to propagate eligible seed and propagative materials for planting for a licensed grower. A licensed nursery may not
grow industrial hemp for harvesting purposes, unless also licensed as a grower.
Grower License —allows
the licensee to: 1) obtain seed or propagative materials for planting; 2) possess authorized seed and/or propagative materials
for planting; 3) cultivate hemp; 4) harvest hemp; 5) possess and store harvested hemp; and 6) transport harvested hemp for processing.
Harvester License —allows
the licensee to harvest an eligible industrial hemp crop for a licensed grower.
Transporter License —allows
the licensee to transport a harvested industrial hemp crop for a licensed grower.
Processor License
—allows the licensee to: 1) engage in the processing, handling, and storage of industrial hemp or hemp seed at one or more
authorized locations in the state; and 2) sell, distribute, transfer, or gift any products processed from harvested hemp that is
not restricted by rule or law.

Employees
 As of June 1, 2019, we have one full time employee with Celexus, Inc, our President, David Soto, who is engaged as a contractor.
