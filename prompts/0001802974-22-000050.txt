Item 1.     Business
Overview
Mission Produce, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Mission Produce” or the “Company,” “Registrant,” or “Issuer,” and generally referred to as “we” or “us”), is a global leader in the avocado industry. The Company’s expertise lies in the farming, packaging, marketing and distribution of avocados to food retailers, distributors and produce wholesalers worldwide. The Company procures avocados principally from California, Mexico and Peru. Through our various operating facilities, we grow, sort, pack, bag and ripen avocados and a small amount of other fruits for distribution to domestic and international markets. We report our results of operations in three operating segments which are also reportable segments:
•Marketing and Distribution sources fruit from growers and then distributes fruit through our global distribution network; 
•International Farming owns and operates orchards from which substantially all fruit produced is sold to our Marketing and Distribution segment. The segment’s farming activities range from cultivating early-stage plantings to harvesting from mature trees. It also earns service revenues for packing and processing for our Blueberries segment, as well as for third-party producers of other crops during the avocado off-harvest season. Operations are principally located in Peru, with smaller operations emerging in other areas of Latin America.
•Blueberries is a farming operation that cultivates blueberry plants in Peru. The entity farms high-quality varieties of blueberries, and has plants in various stages of development, from seedling to mature.
Products and services 
We source, produce, pack and distribute avocados. The avocados we sell are primarily of the Hass variety. We sort and pack avocados and match their specifications to respective customer requirements. We sell both pre-ripe and ripened avocados, and with our network of ripening facilities, we can adjust the level of ripeness to the needs of our customers. Our custom ripening programs provide customers with the option of ordering avocados at five different stages of ripeness – hard, preconditioned, breaking, firm-ripe and ripe – which are delivered on specifically tailored schedules according to stage of ripeness.
We also provide value-added services including ripening, bagging, custom packaging, logistical management, and quality assurance. In addition, we provide our customers with merchandising and promotional support, insights on market trends and hands-on training to assist with their retail sales of our avocados. For example, we operate category management, merchandising and packaging programs, such as our “Avocado Intel,” “Minis,” “Emeralds in the Rough,” “Ready,” “Size Minded,” “small but mighty,” “Jumbos—more to eat, more to love” and shelf-life extension programs, to promote the sale of avocados that might otherwise be underutilized, to identify ready-to-eat and various size avocados for consumers and to increase shelf life. 
Customers
We primarily market avocados to retail, wholesale and foodservice customers. We focus on delivering quality avocados on time and within customer specifications. Owning and farming our own avocado orchards also helps to mitigate potential disruptions across our third-party grower supply relationships. We forecast avocado sourcing costs for the season for our own production, which enables us to enter into fixed price contracts with customers for a season without bearing pricing risk from spot market purchases. We do not have long-term contracts with our customers and focus instead on building strong, long-term relationships based on product quality and specifications, on-time delivery and customer support and service. 
Supply chain and distribution network 
Our global distribution network includes twelve forward distribution centers in North America, China and Europe, equipped to offer value-added services such as ripening, bagging, custom packaging and logistical management. Our network of distribution facilities puts us in close proximity to our customers, allowing us provide fruit based on customer timing, specification, and volume needs. Within the United States, we can deliver avocados within approximately eight hours or less. Internationally, we have distribution centers and investments in other distributors in Europe and Asia to serve the growing retail demand outside of the United States.
Before being forwarded to distribution centers, avocados are sorted and packed at one of our four state-of-art packing facilities in Mexico, Peru, and California, or by co-packers in various locations. Our packing facilities are located in close proximity to growers, 
allowing us to control the logistics of the supply chain from tree to packing, to distribution. Transportation logistics are managed across truck, ocean, air and rail platforms, depending on origin and end markets.
Competition
We compete based on a variety of factors, including the appearance, taste, size, shelf life and overall quality of our fruit, price and distribution terms, the timeliness of our deliveries to customers and the availability of our products. The avocado and fresh produce business is highly competitive, and the effect of competition is intensified because our products are perishable. Marketing competitors include other distributors, producers, and other smaller packers and marketers. Farming competitors include other farming businesses of all sizes, from large-scale businesses and cooperatives, to individual farms.
Resources 
We source avocados primarily from Mexico, Peru, and California, as well as Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa, Chile, and others. Our diverse sourcing network mitigates the impact of potential geographical or grower-specific supply disruptions and optimizes our ability to fulfill year-round global demand. 
Third-party growers
We have relationships with thousands of third-party growers. Our large scale and long track record of working with growers contributes to strong existing relationships and facilitates new relationships with third-party growers. We do not have exclusive sourcing contracts with growers.
Farming
In addition to purchasing avocados from third-party growers, we have vertically integrated farming operations where we grow avocados on owned or leased land. In Peru, we own farmland with developed orchards that are in various stages of maturity. Since fiscal 2020, we have progressively planted new orchards in Guatemala on land under long-term leases, to diversify our vertical integration sourcing strategy. We also invest in a joint venture in Colombia that owns land that is under development. After planting, avocado trees begin to produce avocados in approximately three years and typically reach full production in approximately five to seven years, depending on location. We continue to innovate our farming practices to control the quality of our fruit, through various test plots, seed research, and soil analysis. 
As of October 31, 2022, our approximate international avocado planted acreage, by age and rounded to the nearest hundred, was as follows:

 | Avocado Acreage by Age
Country | 0-3 years | 4-6 years | >7 years | Total
Peru | 3,100 | | 200 | | 6,300 | 9,600 
Guatemala | 800 | | — | | — | 800 
Colombia(1) | 1,400 | | 200 | | — | 1,600 
Total | 5,300 | | 400 | | 6,300 | 12,000

(1)Acreage in Colombia is farmed through a joint venture.
We are also involved in the farming of other fruits on a limited scale. We have planted mango orchards in Peru to enable us to realize synergies from labor and facility management during the avocado off-season. We have also invested in a blueberry farming joint venture, Moruga. While we do not market blueberries, our investment in Moruga further allows us to leverage labor and facility investments in Peru. 
Intellectual property 
We have registered or submitted registrations for certain trademarks with the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office and with the appropriate bodies in international jurisdictions, including The MISSION & TOWER DESIGN® and MISSION PRODUCE™. In addition, we have several issued patents and copyrights that are not material to our business at this time.
Seasonality 
The total sales and sales price of avocados fluctuates throughout the year due to variations in supply of avocados based on geographic location. For example, in California and Peru, the harvest of avocados typically peaks between April and August. In Mexico, avocados are harvested year-round, but the harvest typically peaks between December through March. Although these geographical 
differences may lead to fluctuations in the purchase price of avocados, our diverse geographical avocado growth and production capabilities help us mitigate volatility in our access to supply of avocados. As a result of the volumes sourced from our farming operations in Peru, we realize a greater portion of our gross profit during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.
Human Capital
As of October 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,900 employees located worldwide, of which, 2,500 were located in Peru, 600 were located in Mexico, 400 were located in the U.S., and 400 in other regions such as Guatemala, Europe, Canada and the U.K. Our headcount in Peru is inclusive of our Moruga blueberry operation. Due to the cyclical nature of avocado production, we also hire temporary and seasonal workers on our farms in Peru and packing houses in the U.S. and Mexico to meet our needs. 
For nearly four decades, we have remained rooted in honesty, respect, and loyalty. Globally, we support our people in the distinct ways needed according to their respective regions and environment and commit to treating every individual with dignity and respect by following our human rights declaration. We’ve made actionable goals to address the incorporation of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”) in our organization and industry by sponsoring and participating in certifications and trainings. Appointed teams continually work to improve the working conditions of our people through our Health and Safety program. Our social initiatives embody our core values: Fun, Innovative, Reliable, Successful, and Trustworthy. Our corporate culture embodies these values and, as a result, we believe we have a highly motivated and skilled workforce that is committed to the success of our business. 
Regulation and Industry Associations 
Our business is impacted by environmental, health and safety, government procurement, anti-bribery and other government regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business.
As an agricultural producer and marketer of consumable products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies, including the FDA, the USDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as state and local agencies, with respect to product attributes, packing, labeling, storage and distribution. Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety, purity and labeling. In addition, advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC, and our operations are subject to health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). Our packing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities, including the California State Department of Food and Agriculture (“CFDA”), which oversees weights & measures compliance at our California packing facilities. All of our U.S. facilities are also in compliance with the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, our operations in Mexico are subject to Mexican regulations and our operations in Peru are subject to Peruvian regulations.
The agricultural products sold and marketed by us are subject to additional specific government acts or regulations, including the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 2000 for our avocados.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other matters, the treatment, handling, storage, use and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and waste, including herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural products, the remediation of contaminated properties and climate change.
In the U.S., the Hass Avocado Board was established by the USDA to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados. This board provides a basis for unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (“AFM”) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (“MHAIA”) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (“APEAM”). In Peru, the organization Pro Hass promotes the marketing of high-quality Hass avocados, providing support to the local industry with technical research, packaging, and production.
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance.
