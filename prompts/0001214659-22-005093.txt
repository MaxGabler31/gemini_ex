Business Overview
 
The business of the Company focuses on E-Sports Gaming technology and the development of related infrastructure, specifically the development and commercialization of a technology platform specifically designed for the E-Sports and E-Gaming markets. The URL of the Company’s new website that will host the Company’s technology and services will be https://www.electronicservitor.com/. The mission of the Company is to become the premier content management and distribution platform for esports professionals and gamers on a global basis. The platform will provide an omni-channel publishing tool, with talent identity protection and monetization tools provided in line with interaction and media creation services. Further publication and monetization products and services will be developed and acquired to support these efforts. Specifically, the platform will have the following features:

· | A suite of applications for delivering a superior content experience.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Platform will support the delivery of real-time content from any entertainment system and the integration of on-device services with cloud-based services through a common interface.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The platform will be hardware agnostic and supports automatic OTA updates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | API accessible services for syncing content and settings between the native device applications and cloud services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Automated bandwidth throttled service for updating VOD content, software updates, firmware, or any file-based data to protect streaming capacity
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Live Streaming over IP for IPTV style solutions like Microsoft Mixer and Twitch, Near Live Streaming with dynamic Caching for services like Facebook and YouTube, and VOD assets support for condensed content services like twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilization of outside payment processing services while still anchoring all transitions, whether tied to monetary transactions or not, to a public/private blockchain for 3rd party audit and reporting purposes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Campaign based management of advertising assets, distribution, and reporting across the entirety of the omni-channel distribution network.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Furthermore, the platform will be designed and operated with in line with the following core policies:
 

· | Management of Content: We intend to maintain the highest levels of content quality and clarity without sacrificing availability and omni-channel distribution opportunities. Each channel will provide separate interaction models and feedback on targeted dashboards without compromising the visibility of a channels total reach and value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Management of Game Experiences: We believe that game experiences can often have a life of their own, circling back on each other in direct relationship to the type of user and the level of engagement experienced across a specific community. The platform will track each game property uniquely for this reason, measuring the impact of each property and platform on target communities and publication avenues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Management of Talent: We believe that talent can maximize current engagements with gaming properties, charities, and publishers while creating new and exciting opportunities to engage with new and unique communities without needing to open themselves up to additional effort or risk. Talent management groups can maximize their talents value without adding to their overall communication or engagement burden.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Management of Value: We believe that converting every engagement from a uni-channel to an omni-channel experience without adding to the burden of game properties or talent opens the door to experimental offerings like boutique influence leveraging or line-betting on game experiences.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the proliferation of gaming platforms and streaming offerings has created a marketplace primarily predicated on commoditizing mass volumes of content. We believe that it has proven extremely difficult to scale for the individuals creating the content since successful monetization in this market requires an unbelievable amount of content creation. We believe that the level and intensity of engagement required to be successful E-Sports and E-Gaming markets have thus far proved too high to warrant sustained investment from talent in other sports and media outlets. This barrier to entry has further compounded the other major market issue esports & e-gaming face: a narrow, if passionate, customer base. The sport’s ability to draw large crowds has been largely published, but we believe that it still suffers from creating a product that can be easily consumed by the larger consumer base.
 
We believe that talent and talent representatives need new ways to maximize the value of their engagements and efforts and that the rapidity and scale of the growth of E-Sports and E-Gaming has left talent and the representatives scrambling for ways to catch up. We believe that Game publishers and content publishers are looking for ways to create in-line monetization opportunities and expand the reach of their content, gaming properties, and their connected talent pools. Given these needs, we believe that our platform will enable users to meet these needs.
 
Plan of Operation and Presence in the Market 
 
The Company has developed a technology platform that is specifically designed for esports professionals and gamers. The platform’s functionality will allow its publishing users with omni-channel and technology agnostic streaming functionality so that users can better engage with their audiences on a global level. The platform will also provide in depth engagement analytics. We believe that many esports professionals find it very difficult to showcase their talents while managing the distribution aspects of their careers. The platform will provide these individuals with an easy-to-use solution. The platform will also have content that provides news and information about esports.
 
The Company plans to generate its profits via several revenue streams. The business, on all channels, will receive a percentage of revenues that are generated from advertising and sponsorship-based income. The Company will also form relationships with all major payment gateways where viewers will often provide fees to esports professionals in order to support them (for regular play and tournament play). The business will also receive a percentage of these transactions as well (which will be seamlessly integrated via API functionality on the Electronic Servitor Publication Network platform). Moving forward, the business will implement new solutions that will generate recurring streams of revenue for the business on a monthly basis.
 
Over the next five years, the Company will continue to expand its operations via several different facets of operation. Foremost, the Company will continue to expand its relationships with major esports professionals to ensure that the business has substantial access to top-tier talent. The Company plans to maintain fiscally sound operating protocols and procedures, recruit up-and-coming as well as well-known esports professionals (among a number of gaming genres) in order to provide the Company’s services to a broad spectrum of viewers on a worldwide basis, make continued reinvestments into the Company’s technological infrastructure to ensure smooth streaming at all times and develop the Company as a wealth and income creating vehicle for the Company’s Investors, Management, and other Financial Partners. We plan to grow our business through the following avenues:
 

· | Continued development of relationships with major sports professionals that will have their content managed through the system.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Integration of subscription-based programs that will provide recurring streams of revenue on a monthly basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continued expansion and promotion among numerous online marketing channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


· | Acquisition of additional rounds of capital in order to further fuel the growth of the business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company will also continually expand its technological infrastructure so that higher resolution video streaming can be offered as 5G transmission and 4K resolution become the new standard over the next five years. The new management of the Company will make ongoing and sustained investments into the marketing infrastructure in order to ensure that the business can have millions of active users.
 
We believe that we will be able to maintain successful business operations because of the following:
 

· | Once established, we believe that demand among an audience will continue in perpetuity given the rapidly growing popularity of esports.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will have low operating and overhead costs as a function of revenues.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our revenues will be relatively immune from negative changes in the economy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will enable the integration of global API libraries will allow for the rapid growth of Electronic Servitor Publication Network’s technology and platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E-Sports Gaming Market 
 
The business of providing specialized publishing management and streamed content with the ability to generate revenue from numerous centers is a complicated business that has many operating facets. Typically, we believe that entertainment media content is immune from general changes in the economy, as the low pricing point allows most people to afford programming in any economic climate.
 
Currently, the economic climate is uncertain. The pandemic stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic has created a substantial amount of turmoil within the capital markets. It is expected that a prolonged economic recession will occur given that numerous businesses are being forced to remain closed for an indefinite period of time (while concurrently having their respective employees remain at home). However, the central banks around the world have taken aggressive steps in order to ensure the free flow of capital into financial institutions. This is expected to greatly blunt the economic issues that will arise from this public health matter.
 
It should be noted that we believe that this global health issue will not impact the revenues of Electronic Servitor Publication Network. As more people are at home, the demand for live-streamed esports focused content has increased drastically. We believe that the business, through these operations, will be able to remain profitable and cash flow positive at all times.
 
With the rapid expansion of the number of people that enjoy video gaming (especially online gaming where players interact), the demand for new platforms has skyrocketed over the past ten years. Globally, more than $140 billion is spent each year on video games (among all devices and including subscription-based platforms). The industry has doubled over the past five years as more people use their mobile devices to play video games.
 
We believe that the fastest and largest growing segment of the video game industry is via mobile systems. Nearly $49 billion is spent each year on mobile games. The predicted compounded annual growth rate of the industry is expected to remain around 3% for the next five years. By 2024, mobile gaming revenues are expected to reach $56 billion. Currently, 51% of all video game revenues (on a global basis) are generated from mobile games (although it makes up 32% of game platform usage).
 
Specific for esports entertainment, this industry currently generates $1 billion per year on a global basis. This represents a 14% increase from 2019 to 2020 figures. A substantial portion of this growth has been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic given that people have remained at home and gaming is a popular pastime. Over the next three years, the industry is expected to generate global revenues of $1.6 billion.

Customer Profile 
 
Below is an overview of the demographics of potential users of our platform:
 

· | Current market is predominately male, our targets will be to extend this to a larger female demographic with an initial market emphasis on underserved markets in Latin America.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Between the ages of 13 to 35
--+-----------------------------


· | Annual household income of $35,000+
--+------------------------------------


· | Has an immense interest in e-sports and gaming
--+-----------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the United States alone, there are now 25.7 million eSports viewers. Viewership is expected to increase to 43 million people by 2023.
 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
We plan to maintain strong connections with well-known esports professionals that will use our platform for their content publishing, streaming, and charitable operations. We will develop and expand an expansive marketing apparatus that targets people that have an extensive interest in esports and gaming. We also plan to maintain an expansive presence on social media so that specific content can be promoted among highly targeted demographics (which will further drive interest in our platform as a whole).
 
Management will use both traditional and experimental forms of marketing to inform interested parties about the Company’s highly unique platform. The Company will hire a qualified advertising and public relations firm that will properly position our brand name within this competitive market. While this may contribute to higher upfront marketing costs, we feel that this will be a strong investment given that they will be able to create brand awareness quickly (especially among esports professionals and their mangers that will want to use the platform to generate revenue).
 
Beyond using a qualified marketing firm, the business will have its own in-house marketing manager aggressively use social media to promote the operations (including proprietary content).
 
A major component of the Company’s online marketing will be focused on social media. Management intends to develop strong relationships esports professionals and commentators that are considered social media influencers that will promote our brand name and operations. We believe that this is a very high impact and low cost method of creating excitement about our platform and its unique service proposition (for esports professionals and viewing users). These agreements will vary in cost as it relates to how many followers and subscribers these individuals have on their respective platforms. This method of marketing will drastically boost the visibility of the platform from the onset of operations.
 
It should be noted that esports professionals are expected to receive a majority of their fees from payments from viewers. This will allow the Company to operate with a highly cost-effective method of carrying out proprietary advertising and marketing.
 
As it relates to traditional advertising, Management expects that the Company's retained marketing firm will place print advertisements in major media industry focused publications. Print advertisements will be mirrored among these publications’ online operations.
 
Competition
 
At this time, there is no known platform and technology suite that operates in a similar capacity to that of our platform (provided, however, some technology services providers such as Twitch operate as content delivery systems in the E-Sports market). However, the business could face competition from major streaming services that could replicate the platform for their audiences. As such, it is imperative that the business launch an immense marketing campaign in order to effectively brand our platform as the pioneer in this field.

Legal Matters
 
On November 4, 2021, a lawsuit captioned CAMRON ELIZABETH v. MARK PALUMBO et al., Case No. CVPS2106116 was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside against the Company and certain of the Company’s former executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The Plaintiff and the Company (as CannAssist International Corp.) entered into a Consulting Agreement dated November 20, 2020 (the “Consulting Agreement”), pursuant to which Plaintiff was engaged to provide certain sales and marketing services to the Company. As a condition of this Consulting Agreement, Plaintiff was paid a monthly fee and was granted restricted shares of the common stock of the Company that were subject to certain vesting conditions tied to Plaintiff’s service under the Consulting Agreement. The Consulting Agreement also contained provisions that enabled the Company to terminate the Consulting Agreement without cause after 10 days’ written notice. In September 2021, the Company exercised its right to terminate the Consulting Agreement because management of the Company at the time of termination was dissatisfied with the quality of Plaintiff’s services under the Consulting Agreement. Specifically, management of the Company at the time of termination received complaints from third-parties that Plaintiff behaved inappropriately in meetings where Plaintiff made presentations to potential clients and vendors on behalf of the Company. In contrast, Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the Defendants improperly misclassified Plaintiff as an independent contractor, that certain of the Company’s former executive officers committed sexual harassment and defamation and that Defendants unlawfully terminated Plaintiff. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit.
 
Other than as described above, we know of no other material, existing or pending legal proceedings against the Company, nor is it involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation.

A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of
 
(i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
 
(ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;
 
(iii) the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or
 
(iv) the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 
(i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;
 
(ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;
 
(iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.
 
(A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.

Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
In July 2017, the Company (as Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant to the Exchange Act and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the SEC quarterly and annual reports and management shareholding information. The Company intends to deliver a copy of its annual report to its security holders, and will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements, to any registered shareholder who requests the same.
 
The Company’s documents filed with the SEC may be inspected at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, D.C. Copies of all or any part of the registration statement may be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Call the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference rooms.

All of the Company’s filings may be located under the CIK number 0001709542.
 
PLAN OF OPERATION
 
Business Plan and Potential Revenue
 
The Company has developed a technology platform that is specifically designed for esports professionals and gamers. The platform’s functionality will allow its publishing users with omni-channel and technology agnostic streaming functionality so that users can better engage with their audiences on a global level. The platform will also provide in depth engagement analytics. We believe that many esports professionals find it very difficult to showcase their talents while managing the distribution aspects of their careers. The platform will provide these individuals with an easy-to-use solution. The platform will also have content that provides news and information about esports.
 
The Company plans to generate its profits via several revenue streams. The business, on all channels, will receive a percentage of revenues that are generated from advertising and sponsorship-based income. The Company will also form relationships with all major payment gateways where viewers will often provide fees to esports professionals in order to support them (for regular play and tournament play). The business will also receive a percentage of these transactions as well (which will be seamlessly integrated via API functionality on the Electronic Servitor Publication Network platform). Moving forward, the business will implement new solutions that will generate recurring streams of revenue for the business on a monthly basis.
 
Over the next five years, the Company will continue to expand its operations via several different facets of operation. Foremost, the Company will continue to expand its relationships with major esports professionals to ensure that the business has substantial access to top-tier talent. The Company plans to maintain fiscally sound operating protocols and procedures, recruit up-and-coming as well as well-known esports professionals (among a number of gaming genres) in order to provide the Company’s services to a broad spectrum of viewers on a worldwide basis, make continued reinvestments into the Company’s technological infrastructure to ensure smooth streaming at all times and develop the Company as a wealth and income creating vehicle for the Company’s Investors, Management, and other Financial Partners. We plan to grow our business through the following avenues:
 

· | Continued development of relationships with major sports professionals that will have their content managed through the system.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Integration of subscription-based programs that will provide recurring streams of revenue on a monthly basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continued expansion and promotion among numerous online marketing channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquisition of additional rounds of capital in order to further fuel the growth of the business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company will also continually expand its technological infrastructure so that higher resolution video streaming can be offered as 5G transmission and 4K resolution become the new standard over the next five years. The new management of the Company will make ongoing and sustained investments into the marketing infrastructure in order to ensure that the business can have millions of active users.
 
For the next few months, the Company will be focusing on developing and launching its platform, marketing and identifying customers.
 
There is no assurance that the Company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital, or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer and several shareholders may fund the Company’s operations, if needed, during the next 12 months or until the Company can generate an ongoing source of capital sufficient to independently continue its operations.
 
The Company anticipates that it would need approximately $1,500,000 over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern, satisfy its capital commitments and continue its operations in accordance with its current business plan, which will be used to fund expenses related to Platform Finalization Costs, Initial Marketing, Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment, Working Capital, Professional Fees and Licensure and Miscellaneous Development Costs. Management believes that this capital would allow the Company to meet its operating cash requirements, cover overhead cost and general liabilities of the Company, and allow the Company to achieve overall sustainable profitability by facilitating the Company’s business.
