Corporate History
 
DSG Global Inc. (formerly Boreal Productions Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2007. The Company was initially formed to option and package rights for feature film and television projects.
 
Upon incorporation we received our initial funding of $9,000 through the sale of common stock to our then sole officer and director, who purchased 3,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock at $0.003 per share and $45,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock issued to 30 un-affiliated investors at $0.015 per share. On June 11, 2008, we effected a five for one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 375,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock and our outstanding share capital increased from 6,000,000 shares of pre-reverse split common stock to 30,000,000 shares of pre-reverse split common stock.
 
On April 13, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Vantage Tag Systems Inc. (“VTS”) (formerly DSG Tag Systems Inc.) and the shareholders of VTS who become parties to the share exchange agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire not less than 75% and up to 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of VTS’s common stock in exchange for the issuance by our company of up to 20,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock to the shareholders of VTS on the basis of one of our pre-reverse split common shares for 5.4935 common shares of VTS.
 
Previously, in anticipation of the share exchange agreement with VTS, we undertook to change our name and effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued common stock. Accordingly, on January 19, 2015, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly owned subsidiary DSG Global Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Boreal Productions Inc. to DSG Global Inc. Our company remains the surviving company. DSG Global Inc. was formed solely for the change of name.
 
Also, on January 19, 2015, our company’s board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a three (3) old for one (1) new basis. Upon effect of the reverse split, our authorized capital will decrease from 375,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock to 125,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease from 30,000,000 to 10,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.
 
Articles of Merger to effect the merger and change of name and a Certificate of Change to affect the reverse stock split were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 22, 2015, with an effective date of February 2, 2015. The name change and forward split were reviewed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) were approved for filing with an effective date of February 23, 2015.
 
The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and OTC Markets quotation system at the opening of trading on February 23, 2015 under the symbol “BRPOD”. Effective March 19, 2015 our stock symbol changed to “DSGT”. Our new CUSIP number following the symbol change is 23340C104. The first trade of our common shares occurred on March 25, 2015.

On May 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of approximately 75% (82,435,748 common shares) of the issued and outstanding common shares of DSG TAG Systems as contemplated by the share exchange agreement by issuing 15,185,875 shares of our common stock to shareholders of DSG TAG Systems who became parties to the agreement. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued an additional 179,823 shares of our common stock to Westergaard Holdings Ltd. in partial settlement of accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness of DSG TAG Systems.
 
Following the initial closing of the share exchange agreement and through October 22, 2015, we acquired an additional 101,200 shares of common stock of DSG TAG from shareholders who became parties to the share exchange agreement and issued to these shareholders an aggregate of 18,422 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock. Following completion of these additional purchases, DSG Global Inc. owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DSG TAG.
 
The reverse acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein DSG TAG Systems is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. We adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG Systems upon the closing of the share exchange agreement.
 
Subsequent to the closing of the share exchange agreement with DSG TAG, we adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG.
 
DSG TAG was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2008 and extra provincially registered in British Columbia, Canada in 2008. In March 2011, DSG TAG formed DSG Tag Systems International, Ltd. in the United Kingdom (“DSG UK”). DSG UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of DSG TAG.
 
On March 26, 2019, we effected a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a four thousand (4,000) for one (1) basis. Upon effect of the reverse split, our authorized capital decreased from 3,000,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock to 750,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 2,761,333,254 pre-reverse split to 690,403 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001. Our outstanding shares of Preferred Stock remain unchanged. This Form 10-K gives retroactive effect to such reverse stock split named above and all share and per share amounts have been adjusted accordingly, unless otherwise noted.
 
Subsequent to the closing of the share exchange agreement with DSG Tag Systems, Inc. (“DSG TAG”), we adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG. DSG TAG is now known as Vantage Tag Systems, Inc. (“VTS”).

Recent Business Developments
 
Fleet Management and Golf Division
 
We have developed the TAG suite of products that we believe is the first completely modular fleet management solution for the golf industry. The TAG suite of products is currently sold and installed around the world in golf facilities, and in commercial settings, through a network of established distributors and in partnership with some of the most notable brands in fleet and equipment manufacture.
 
DSG stands for “Digital Security Guard”, which is our primary value statement giving fleet operator’s new capabilities to track and control their vehicles. We have developed a proprietary combination of hardware and software that is marketed around the world as the TAG system. We have primarily focused on the golf industry where the TAG system is deployed to help golf course operators manage their fleet of golf carts, turf equipment, and utility vehicles. We are a leader in the category of fleet management in the golf industry and were awarded “Best Technology of the Year” in 2010 by Boardroom magazine, a publication of the National Golf Course Owners Association. To date the TAG system is installed on over 8,000 vehicles and has been used to monitor over 6,000,000 rounds of golf.
 
The TAG system fills a void in the marketplace by offering a modular structure that allows the customer to customize their system to meet desired functionality and budget constraints. In addition to the core TAG system vehicle control functionality, which can operate independently, we offer two golfer information display systems — the alphanumeric INFINITY 10” and high-definition INFINITY XL 12” — providing the operator with two display options which is unique in the industry.
 
The primary market for our TAG system is the 40,000 golf operations worldwide. While the golf industry remains the primary focus of our sales and marketing efforts, we have completed several successful pilots of the TAG system in other markets such as agriculture and commercial fleet operations. With appropriate resources, we intend to expand our sales and marketing efforts into these new markets.
 
We have a direct sales force in North America, which comprises the most significant portion of the golf fleet market and have developed key relationships with distributors and golf equipment manufacturers such as E-Z-GO, Yamaha and Ransomes Jacobsen to help drive sales for the North American and worldwide markets.
 
In order to successfully deliver products, increase sales, and maintain customer satisfaction, we need to have a reliable supplier of our hardware units and components at competitive prices. Presently, we source our INFINITY XL 12” units from one supplier in China and our TAG units from one supplier in the United Kingdom. We have recently established a new relationship with a supplier for our INFINITY XL 12” units in China to provide us with higher quality, newer technology at competitive pricing. We are also exploring the opportunity of a partnership with a US manufacturer.

Electric Vehicle Market Overview
 
United States
 
The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on U.S. roads is projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7% of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. EV sales in the United States were up 79% in 2018 while global EV sales grew 64% in the same year.

10
--

Canada
 
Sales for 2018 were over 150% higher than 2017 and saw more EVs sold across the country in 2018 than in the previous three years combined. Nearly 3% of all new vehicles are electric, a higher rate than in the United States.
Mexico
 
EV sales in Latin America increased by 90% in 2018 due to growing demand in Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica. While the LatAm EV market is far smaller than East Asia, Europe and North America, accounting for less than 1% of global EV sales in 2018, it is starting to grow thanks to a handful of incentives and targets. Mexico and Costa Rica, for example, exempt EVs from numerous taxes while Colombia has an ambitious target of 600,000 EVs on its roads by 2030.
 
Companies are also increasing their activity. BYD Co. now sells electric buses across the region and Tesla Inc. recently launched its best-selling Model 3 in Mexico.
 
Caribbean
 
While most Caribbean islands are rapidly modernizing their electric grids, the modernization of transportation systems has lagged. Is change in the air? In November, the government of Bermuda signed a memorandum of understanding with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), embracing a plan to fully transition the island’s transportation sector to EVs.
 
The case for EVs is strong in Bermuda, as it is across the Caribbean. With predominantly flat terrain and driving distances that are short enough to eliminate “range anxiety,” EVs make perfect sense.
 
Caribbean nations are uniquely positioned to reap major benefits from EVs with the abundance of sunshine that could provide renewable solar power on a significant scale. EV adoption would also reduce reliance on fuel imports, which creates extreme economic vulnerability linked to oil price fluctuations as well as contribute to disaster resilience through energy storage—EV batteries can serve as backup power sources during hurricanes.
 
Imperium Motor Company Experience Center 
 
Our Imperium Electric Vehicle Northern California Experience Center is in Fairfield, Solano County, California. Solano County is situated between two of the largest Electric Vehicle markets in California, the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Sacramento with a combined population of over 10 million people. California is historically the top EV sales volume state with 50% of sales within the United States. The building sits right next to the crossroads of Freeway 80 and Freeway 680 in one of the best economic areas in the nation.
 
The Experience Center will feature the various models of new Electric Cars, Trucks, Vans, UTVs, ATVs and Scooters arriving soon from the manufacturer. The new building will not only display our new selection of Electric Vehicles but will also host the center for Dealer training and Parts and Service support.
 
Imperium Distribution Network 
 
We are currently marketing and offering direct sales of our electric vehicles at our Imperium Motor Company Experience Center. However, it is our objective to establish a network of experienced, authorized automotive dealers across the United States and throughout our territory. We are currently recruiting and vetting applicant dealerships and expect to announce our inaugural group of authorized dealers in 2021.
Imperium’s Green Story
 
Gas powered combustion engines are not the future of transportation, they are the past. Our line of electric vehicles produces no emissions, almost no heat, little noise, and can be fully powered by renewable electricity producing resources like solar and wind energy. Imperium intends to offer a combination solar/wind home charging station for a 100% sustainable, 100% zero carbon solution.

Competition in the EV Market
 
The EV market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly, with new manufacturers and distributors consistently entering the industry to satisfy actual and expected growth in the demand for competitively priced vehicles. As a result, we expect that we will experience significant competition from new and established manufacturers, marketers and distributors. These include niche manufacturers of specialty electric vehicles, and large established manufacturers of automobiles. These, including manufacturers of EVs such as the Tesla Model S, the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf.
 
Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively.
 
DSG Technologies and Products—Fleet Management and Golf Division
 
We have developed the TAG suite of products that we believe is the first completely modular fleet management solution for the golf industry. The TAG suite of products is currently sold and installed around the world in golf facilities and as commercial applications through a network of established distributors and partnerships with some of the most notable brands in fleet and equipment manufacture.
 
VTS is giving fleet operator’s new capabilities to track and control their vehicles through the new INFINITY XL system and the new 3G-4G TAG. We have developed in-house a proprietary combination of hardware and software that is marketed around the world as the INFINITY TAG system. We have primarily focused on the golf industry where the TAG system is deployed to help golf course operators manage their fleet of golf carts, turf equipment, and utility vehicles. We are a leader in the category of fleet management in the golf industry and were awarded “Best Technology of the Year” in 2010 by Boardroom magazine, a publication of the National Golf Course Owners Association. To date, the TAG system is installed on vehicles around the world and has been used to monitor millions of rounds of golf.
 
The TAG system fills a void in the marketplace by offering a modular structure that allows the customer to customize their system to meet desired functionality and budget constraints. In addition to the core TAG system vehicle control functionality, which can operate independently, we offer 3 information display systems to the golf courses management and golfer — the alphanumeric TEXT and high definition 12” INFINITY XL, 10” INFINITY RM and 10” INFINITY DM— providing the operator with three display options which is unique in the industry. VTS also offers inhouse financing thru purchase or lease.
 
The primary market for our TAG system is the golf industry, with over 40,000 golf operations worldwide. While the golf industry remains the primary focus of our sales and marketing efforts, we have completed several successful pilots of the TAG system in other markets such as agriculture and commercial fleet operations. With appropriate resources, we intend to expand our sales and marketing efforts into these new markets.
 
We are expanding our sales force in North America, which comprises the most significant portion of the golf fleet market and have developed key relationships with privately owned distributors and golf equipment manufacturers such as E-Z-GO, Yamaha and Ransomes Jacobsen to help drive sales through-out Europe, Asia, UK and many other markets worldwide Including our most recent move to New Zealand and Australia.
 
Our most recent Vantage product range includes the Vantage brand Fleet golf cart, and retail golf carts for individual users under the Vantage and Shelby brands. Shelby Golf cart products represent a unique offering within the golf and low speed vehicle industry, emphasizing customization and user brand association. Shelby products will be sold via DSG and a network of licensed Shelby dealers under the AC Golf Carts outlet brand. Those dealers will also act as service agents for both Shelby products and other DSG products in their locality.

In order to successfully deliver products, increase sales, and maintain customer satisfaction, we need to have a reliable supplier of our hardware units and components at competitive prices. Presently, we source our TAG and INFINITY fleet from a North American Fortune 200 company with manufacturing in China and our RAPTORS from a supplier operating in the United Kingdom and Asia. This new relationship that has been established provides us with higher quality, newer technology at a competitive price.
 
In addition, VTS recently engaged with a telecommunications provider to provide new technology in hardware and wireless access through-out the world therefor allowing VTS to substantially reduce cellular cost.
 
Technology Overview
 
DSG produces a “modular” suite of products to provide fleet management solution for any vehicle required for a golf operation and provides two golfer information display options to meet the operators budget requirements. DSG believes that it is currently the only company in the golf fleet management industry with these capabilities.
 
The VTS TAG System is designed from the ground up to be a golf/turf vehicle fleet management system. Its main function is addressing the golf course operator needs. While employing same core technology (cellular wireless and GPS) as traditional commercial vehicle fleet management systems, DSG has created patent pending solutions to adapt it to the very specific requirements of the golf environment. Compared to mainstream fleet tracking products, DSG collects 10 to 50 times more data points per MB (megabyte) of cellular data due to its proprietary data collection and compression algorithms. Also, the relative positioning accuracy is improved by almost one order of magnitude by the use of application-specific geo-data validation and correction methods.
 
DSG’s proprietary methods make it possible to offer a solution suitable for use on golf courses at a price low enough to be affordable in the industry. Every system component incorporates state-of-the-art technology (server, mobile trackers, display). In developing its products VTS TAG Systems has adopted an application-oriented approach placing the most emphasis (and research & development) on server and end-user software by taking advantage of the commodity level reached by mainstream technologies such as Global Positioning (GPS) and M2M (Machine to Machine) Cellular Data in the wider context of Commercial Fleet Management.
 
DSG leveraged the existence of an abundance of very cost-effective telematics solutions by selecting an “off-the-shelf” hardware platform that meets all the main performance and environmental requirements for operation in the harsh, outdoor golf course environment. While removing all risk and cost associated with developing a proprietary hardware platform, DSG has maintained the unique nature of its hardware solution by developing a set of proprietary adapters and interfaces specifically for the golf application.
 
DSG has secured an exclusive supply agreement with the third-party hardware manufacturers for the vertical of golf industry. Additionally, DSG owns the design of all proprietary adapters and interfaces. This removes the risk of a potential competitor utilizing the same hardware platform. Competitors could attempt to reverse engineer or copycat the TAG technology and equipment. This risk factor is mitigated by the fact that our product does not rely on a particular technology or hardware platform to be successful but on a very specific vertical software application that is far more difficult to copy (and respectively easier to protect).

--


The application software contains patent features implemented in every core component of the system. The TAG device runs DSG proprietary firmware incorporating unique data collection and compression algorithms. The web server software which powers the end-user application is also proprietary and incorporates the industry knowledge accumulated through the over 70 years of collective experience of the DSG team.
 
This approach has given the product line a high level of endurance against technology obsolescence. At any point in time, if a hardware component is discontinued or a better/less expensive hardware platform becomes available, the software application can be easily adapted to operate on the new platform or with the new component. The company benefits from the constant increase of performance and cost reduction of mainstream hardware technology without any additional cost.
 
The web-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model used by VTS TAG System is optimal for low operating and support costs and rapid-cycle release for software updates. It is also a major factor in eliminating or substantially reducing the need for any end-user premises equipment. Customers have access to the service through any internet connected computer or mobile device, there is no need for a local wireless network on the facility and installation time and cost are minimal.
 
DSG is positioned to take advantage of mainstream technology and utilize “best of breed” hardware platforms to create new generations of products. Our software is designed to be “portable” to future new platforms with better GPS and wireless technology in order to maintain the Company competitive edge.
 
All new product development effort of DSG is following the same model: select the best of breed third-party hardware platform, design and produce custom proprietary accessories while focusing the bulk of the development efforts on vertical software application to address a very specific set of end-customer needs.
 
The latest addition to the TAG family of products, the TAG INFINITY is a perfect example of this development philosophy in action: the main component is a last-generation Android tablet PC wrapped in a custom designed outdoor enclosure containing the power supply and interface components required for the golf environment. The software application is taking advantage of all the advanced high-resolution graphics, touch user interface and computing power of the Android OS delivering a vastly superior user experience compared to competitive systems. The time to market for this product was 30% of how long it took to develop and launch this type of products in the past.

The TAG Control Unit
 
The company’s flagship product is the TAG Control unit. The TAG can operate as a “stand alone” unit or with one of two displays; the INFINITY 10” alphanumeric display or the INFINITY high definition “touch activated” screen. The TAG is GPS enabled and communicates with the TAG software using cellular GSM networks. Utilizing the cellular networks rather than erecting a local Wi-Fi network assures carrier grade uptime, and vehicle tracking “off- property”. GSM is the de facto global standard for mobile communications.
 
The TAG unit itself is discreetly installed usually in the nose of the vehicle to give the GPS clear line of site. It is then connected to the vehicle battery and ignition. The property is then mapped using the latest satellite imagery that is graphically enhanced and loaded into the TAG System as a map.
 
Once installed the vehicle owner utilizes the TAG software to locate the vehicle in real time using any computer, smartphone, or tablet that has an internet connection and perform various management operations.
 

The operator can use the geo-fencing capabilities to create “zones” on the property where they can control the vehicles behavior such as shutting down a vehicle that is entering a sensitive or dangerous area. The TAG System also monitors the strength of the vehicle’s battery helping to prevent sending out vehicles undercharged batteries which can be an inconvenience for the course and negatively impact the golfer experience.
 
Features and Benefits:
 

● | Internal battery utilizing Smart Power technology which charges the battery only when the vehicle is running (gas) or being charged (electric)

PROGRAMMATIC Advertising Platform
 
A unique feature of the INFINITY XL 12” system is the advertising display capability. This can be used by the operator for internal promotion of services or for generating revenue by selling the ad real estate since the golf demographic is very desirable to advertisers. The INFINITY XL 12” displays banner, panel, full page, pro tip, and Green view ads. There is also ad real estate on the interactive feature screens for Food and Beverage ordering and the scorecard. The Infinity XL 12” System can also display animated GIF files or play video for added impact.
 

Advertising displayed in multiple formats including animated GIF and video
 
DSG has developed proprietary “Ad Manager” software which is used to place and change the ads on the system(s) from a central NOC (Network Operations Center) in real time. The Ad Manager can deploy to a single system or multiple systems. This creates a network of screens that is also very desirable to advertisers as ad content can be deployed locally, regionally, or nationally. The advertising platform is an important part of the company’s future marketing and sales strategy.

TAG TURF/ECO TAG
 
The TAG Turf and the new ECO TAG were developed to give course operators the same back end management features for their turf equipment and utility vehicles. Turf equipment is expensive, and a single piece can run over $100,000 and represents a large portion of a golf course operating budget. The TAG Turf and ECO TAG have comprehensive reporting that the operator can utilize to implement programs that can increase efficiencies, reduce labor costs, help lower idle times, provide fuel consumption and equipment performance, provide historical data on cutting patterns, and reduce pollution from emissions by monitoring idle times. Since the golf course needs to be maintained regardless of volume these cost saving measures directly impact the operator’s bottom line.

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. In order for us to successfully compete in our industry we must:

● | demonstrate our products’ competitive advantages; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
We believe that we will be able to compete effectively in our industry because of the versatility, reliability, and relative affordability of our products when compared to those of our competitors. We will attempt to build awareness of our competitive advantages among existing and potential customers through trade shows, sales visits and demonstrations, online marketing, and positive word of mouth advertising.
 
However, as we are a newly established company relative to our competitors, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as limited access to capital. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
 
Our primary competitor in the field of golf course fleet management is GPS Industries, a company that was founded in 1996 by our sole officer, founder and one of our directors, Mr. Bob Silzer. GPS Industries is currently the largest player in the marketplace with an installed base of approximately 750 golf courses worldwide. GPS Industries was consolidated by various mergers and acquisitions with a diversity of hardware platforms and application software. Since 2009, when GPS Industries has introduced their latest product offering called the Visage, in an exclusive partnership with Club Car, their strategy has been to target mostly their existing customers and motivate them into replacing their existing, older GPS system, with the Visage system.
 
GPS Industries is leveraging very heavily their partnership with Club Car, which is one of the three largest golf cart manufacturers in the world and at times is benefiting from golf operators’ preference for Club Car and their vehicles when they select their management system.
 
Market Mix
 
Since the introduction of the DSG product line, we have shown golf course operators that they have now access to a budget-friendly fleet management tool that works not only on golf carts but also with all other vehicles used on the golf course such as turf maintenance, shuttles, and other utility vehicles.
 
Marketing studies have identified that half of the golf course operators only need a fleet management system and only 15% need a high-end GPS golf system. This illustrates the strong competitive advantage that VTS TAG Systems has versus GPS Industries since their product can only address the needs of a relatively small fraction of the marketplace.
 
Consequently, GPS Industries’ installed base has steadily declined since most of their new product installations have replaced older product for existing customers and some customers have opted for a lower budget system and switched over to VTS TAG Systems.

Marketing Activities
 
The Company has a multi-layered approach marketing the TAG suite of products. One of the foundations of this plan is attending industry trade shows which are well attended by golf operators. The two largest shows are the PGA Merchandise Show and the Golf Industry Show which are held in Florida at the end of January. The Company also attends a number of regional shows around North America. International events are attended by our distributors and partners.
 
The second layer of marketing is memberships in key organizations such as the National Golf Course Owners Association, Golf Course Superintendents Association, and Club Managers Association of America. These are very influential in the industry and have marketing channels such as publications, email blasts, and web-based marketing. The Company also markets directly to course operators through email, surveys direct mail programs.
 
Lead Generation
 
One of the primary sources of lead generation is through the Company’s strategic partnerships with E-Z-GO, Yamaha, and Ransomes Jacobson. These relationships provide the Company with a great deal of market intelligence. The sales forces of the partners work in tandem with the DSG sales team by passing on the leads, creating joint proposals, and distributing TAG sales material. The Company has also created co-branded materials for specific value items of interest to operators such as Pace of Play solutions. DSG sale s and marketing staff attend partner sales events to conduct training and discuss marketing strategies.
 
The Company is in the process of testing an internal telemarketing program in several key markets to gauge whether this particular channel warrants larger scale implementation.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Pricing
 
One of the “heroes” of the TAG System is providing the course operator a range of modular fleet management options that are very competitively priced. Pricing options range from the TURF, TAG, Infinity 10”, and Infinity XL 12” System, giving the customer a wide range of pricing options.
 
Functional advantages
 
DSG has the distinctive advantage of being able to offer a true fleet management system, encompassing all the vehicles on the golf course, not just the golf carts. Due to the modular nature of the system, customers have now the option to configure their system’s configuration to match exactly their needs and their budget.
 
Product advantages
 
DSG products are the robust, reliable, and user-friendly systems in the world. DSG is the only company currently providing systems that are waterproof with internal batteries to ensure our partners retain the full golf cart manufacturer’s warranty.

Product Supply Chain
 
In order to maintain high product quality and control, and to optimize production costs, the Company is currently procuring all main hardware components offshore. Final assembly is locally performed to ensure product quality. Other key components are also procured directly from local manufacturers or suppliers to keep the price as low as possible.
 
The Company is requesting the suppliers to perform a complete set of quality testing and minimum 24 hours’ burn-in before the product is delivered. The local hardware assembler and components supplier offers a 12-month warranty. The main hardware components offshore supplier offers a warranty plan of 15 months from the date the product is shipped. With an extended 90 days beyond the current warranty, such repair service would be paid by the supplier except for component replacement costs, which would be paid by DSG.
 
Another important activity related to the management of the product supply chain is working closely with the suppliers and ensuring that we have alternate sources for the main components and identify well in advance any components that may go “end-of-life” and find suitable replacements before product shortages may occur.
 
Inventory Control
 
The Company has implemented strict inventory management procedures that govern the inbound flow of products from suppliers, the outgoing flow to customers as well as the internal movement of inventory between warehouses (Canada, US and UK). There are also procedures in place to control the flow of equipment returning from customers for repairs and their replacements.

Installation
 
The Company is utilizing a small number of its own field engineers, geographically positioned to be in close proximity of areas with high concentrations of current and future customers. Occasionally, when new installations exceed the internal capacity, the company employs a number of external contractors, on a project-by-project basis. Each contractor has been trained extensively to perform product installations and the Company has created an extensive collection of Installation Manuals for all products and vehicle types.
 
The product was designed with ease of installation as one of its features. Additionally, the installation process includes a pre-shipping configuration process that prepares each device with all the settings and graphics content (if applicable) required for the specific location it will be deployed. This makes the installation process a lot simpler and less time consuming in the field which reduces costs (accommodations, food, travel) for internal staff as well as external contractor cost (less billable time).
 
Another benefit of the simplified installation procedure is increased scalability in anticipation of increased number of installs in the future by reducing the skill level and training time requirements for additional contractors.
 
Customer Service
 
The Company has deployed its Customer Service staff strategically, so it has at least one service representative active during business hours in North America, Europe and South Africa.
 
The Company is handling Customer Service directly in North America and UK, offering telephone and on-line support to end-customers. In other international markets, the first-line customer service is handled by local distributor’s staff while DSG is supplying training and more advanced support to the distributors.
 
For the management of the customer service activities, the Company is utilizing SalesForce.com CRM system which allows creating, updating, closing and escalation of service cases, including the issuance of RMA (Return Material Authorization) numbers for defective equipment. Using SalesForce.com also allows generation of management reports for service issues, customer satisfaction, and equipment failures in order to quickly identify trends, problem accounts or systemic issues.
 
In addition, DSG began offering the DSG Par 72 Service & Support Plan to guarantee service and support to client courses in the golf business, during fiscal 2016. This program for client courses which guarantees service and support programs within 24 hours of a problem arising.
 
Product Development and Engineering
 
The Company employs a team of software engineers in house to develop and maintain the main components of the server software and firmware.
 
All product development is derived from business needs assessment and customer requests.
 
The Product Manager is reviewing periodically the list of feature requests with the Sales, establishes priorities and updates the Product Roadmap.
 
The software engineers are also responsible for developing specialized tools and systems utilized increase efficiency in the operation of the Company. These projects include functionality such as: automated system monitoring, automatic service alerts, improved remote troubleshooting tools, cellular data monitoring and reporting. All these tools are critical in future ability to support more customers with less resources, streamline support, and improve internal efficiency.
 
All hardware development (electronics and mechanical) is generally outsourced, however small projects like mounting solutions or cabling are handled in house.
