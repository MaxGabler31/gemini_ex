ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We are the largest branded marketer in North America of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. We own two of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children’s apparel industry, Carter’s and OshKosh B’gosh (or “OshKosh”). Our brand portfolio also includes Skip Hop, a leading baby and young child lifestyle brand, exclusive Carter’s brands developed for specific wholesale customers, and little planet, a brand focused on organic fabrics and sustainable materials.
Established in 1865, our Carter’s brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel and accessories for children in sizes newborn to 14.
Established in 1895, OshKosh is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel and accessories for children in sizes newborn to 14, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children. We acquired OshKosh in 2005.
Established in 2003, the Skip Hop brand re-thinks, re-energizes, and re-imagines durable necessities to create higher value, superior quality, and top-performing products for parents, babies, and toddlers. We acquired Skip Hop in 2017.
Additionally, Child of Mine, an exclusive Carter’s brand, is sold at Walmart; Just One You, an exclusive Carter’s brand, is sold at Target, and Simple Joys, an exclusive Carter’s brand, is available on Amazon.
Launched in 2021, the little planet brand focuses on sustainable clothing through the sourcing of mostly organic cotton as certified under the Global Organic Textile Standard. This brand includes a wide assortment of baby apparel and accessories, sleepwear, and gift bundles.
Our mission is to serve the needs of all families with young children, with a vision to be the world’s favorite brands in young children’s apparel and related products. We believe our brands provide a complementary product offering and aesthetic, are each uniquely positioned in the marketplace, and offer strong value to families with young children. The baby and young children’s apparel market ages zero to 10 in the U.S. is approximately $31 billion as of December 2021. In this market, our Carter’s brands, including our exclusive brands, hold the #1 position with approximately 10% market share and our OshKosh brand has approximately 1% market share as of December 2021. 
Our multi-channel, global business model, which includes retail stores, eCommerce, and wholesale sales channels, as well as retail omni-channel capabilities in the United States and Canada, enables us to reach a broad range of consumers around the world. At the end of fiscal 2021, our channels included 980 retail stores, approximately 18,800 wholesale locations, and eCommerce websites in North America, as well as our international wholesale accounts and licensees who operate in over 90 countries.
During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, the global pandemic, caused by the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus (including variants, “COVID-19”), negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant disruption of the financial and retail markets, including a disruption in consumer demand for baby and children’s clothing and accessories during fiscal 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic on the Company, and our response to the pandemic, see “Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our three business segments are: U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale, and International. These segments are our operating and reporting segments. Our U.S. Retail segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products in the United States through our retail stores and eCommerce websites. Similarly, our U.S. Wholesale segment consists of revenue primarily from sales in the United States of products to our wholesale partners. Finally, our International segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products outside the United States, largely through our retail stores and eCommerce websites in Canada and Mexico, and sales to our international wholesale customers and licensees. Additional financial and geographical information about our segments is contained in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and under Note 14, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements.
We have extensive experience in the young children’s apparel and accessories market and focus on delivering products that satisfy our consumers’ needs. Our long-term growth strategy focuses on:
•providing the best value and experience in apparel and related products for young children;
•extending the reach of our brands; and
•improving profitability.
Our Brands
Carter’s & OshKosh B’gosh
Our Carter’s and OshKosh product offerings include apparel and accessories for babies (sizes newborn to 24 months), toddlers (sizes 2T to 5T), and kids (sizes 4-14).
For our Carter’s brand, our focus is on essential, high-volume apparel products for babies and young children, including bodysuits, pants, dresses, multi-piece knit sets, blankets, layette essentials, bibs, booties, sleep and play, rompers, and jumpers. We attribute our leading market position to our strong value proposition, brand strength, unique colors, distinctive prints, and commitment to quality, as well as our broad wholesale distribution channel that includes successful and long-standing relationships with leading global and national retailers. Our marketing programs are targeted toward first-time parents, experienced parents, and gift-givers. Our core baby product line, the largest component of our baby business, provides families with essential products and accessories, including value-focused multi-piece sets. We also have three exclusive Carter’s brands: our Child of Mine brand, which we sell at Walmart, our Just One You brand, which we sell at Target, and our Simple Joys brand, which we sell on Amazon. In 2021, we launched our little planet brand, which focuses on organic fabrics and sustainable materials.
Carter’s is the leading brand in the zero to 10-year-old market in the United States, with particular strength in the zero to two-year-old segment. As of December 2021, our multi-channel business model enabled our Carter’s brands to maintain leading market share of approximately 10% in the zero to 10-year-old market, which represented nearly double the market share of the next largest brand. In addition, our Carter’s brands maintained the leading market position with approximately 21% in the zero to two-year-old baby market, which represented nearly four times the market share of the next largest brand, and maintained its leading market position with approximately 11% in the three to four-year-old toddler market, which represented approximately 1.5 times the market share of the next largest brand. The slight decrease in market share compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to our strategic focus on growing operating profitability, which increased more than the sales growth in the overall market. 
The focus of the OshKosh brand is high-quality playclothes, including denim apparel products with multiple wash treatments and coordinating garments, overalls, woven bottoms, knit tops, and bodysuits for everyday use. Our OshKosh brand is generally positioned towards an older age segment and at slightly higher average prices relative to the Carter’s brand. We believe our OshKosh brand has significant brand name recognition, which consumers associate with high-quality, durable, and authentic playclothes for young children. As of December 2021, our OshKosh brand’s market share was approximately 1% of the zero to 10-year-old apparel market in the United States.
For both our Carter’s and OshKosh brands, we employ cross-functional product teams to focus on the development of the brands and products. The teams include members from merchandising, art, design, sourcing, product development, marketing and planning, and follow a disciplined approach to fabric usage, color selection, and assortment productivity. We believe this disciplined approach to product development, which includes consumer research, results in a compelling product offering to consumers, reduces our exposure to short-term trends, and supports efficient operations.
We believe that we continue to strengthen our brand image with the consumer by differentiating our products through fabric and material improvements, new artistic applications, new packaging and presentation strategies, and marketing. We also attempt to differentiate our products and presentation through in-store fixturing, branding, signage, photography, and advertising, both in our stores and on our websites, as well as with our major wholesale customers.
Licensed Products
We license our Carter’s, OshKosh, Child of Mine, Just One You, Simple Joys, and Carter’s My First Love brands to partners to expand our product offerings to include footwear, outerwear, accessories (such as hair accessories and jewelry), toys, paper goods, home décor, cribs and baby furniture, and bedding. These licensing partners develop and sell products through our multiple sales channels, while leveraging our brand strength, customer relationships, and designs. Licensed products provide our customers with a range of lifestyle products that complement and expand upon our baby and young children’s apparel offerings. Our license agreements require strict adherence to our quality and compliance standards and provide for a multi-step 
product approval process. We work in conjunction with our licensing partners in the development of their products to ensure that they fit within our brand vision of high-quality products at attractive prices to provide value to the consumer. 
We also partner with other brand owners to further expand our product offerings, including apparel with collegiate and professional sport teams’ logos.
Skip Hop
Under our Skip Hop brand, we design, source, and market products that are sold primarily to families with young children. Our Skip Hop brand is best known for its diaper bags, which we believe combine innovative functionality with attractive design. The Skip Hop brand offering also includes products for playtime, travel, mealtime, kid’s bags, bath time, and home gear.
We believe Skip Hop is a global lifestyle brand. Skip Hop’s core philosophy and positioning begins and ends with its brand promise -- “Must-Haves * Made Better.” This reflects the brand’s goal of creating innovative, smartly designed, and highly functional essentials for parents, babies, and toddlers. The Skip Hop team includes both an in-house design and a creative team, each of which is dedicated to meeting that goal. We carry Skip Hop brand products in our retail stores, and have made investments in in-store fixturing, branding, and signage packages, along with digital advertising, to further strengthen the position of the Skip Hop brand.
Our Sales Channels
We sell our Carter’s, OshKosh, and Skip Hop branded products through multiple channels, both in the United States and globally.
U.S. Retail
Our U.S. Retail segment includes sales of our products through our U.S. retail stores and eCommerce sites, including through our omni-channel capabilities to allow our customers to buy on-line and pick-up in store (or curbside), buy-online and ship-to-store, and in-store buy on-line services.
Our U.S. retail stores are generally located in high-traffic strip shopping centers and malls in or near major cities or in outlet centers that are near densely-populated areas. We believe our brand strength and our product assortment have made our retail stores a destination for consumers seeking young children’s apparel and accessories.
Each of our stores carries an assortment of Carter’s, OshKosh, and/or Skip Hop branded products, as well as other products, depending on the store and location. As of the end of fiscal 2021, our stores averaged approximately 5,000 square feet per location, ranging from on average approximately 4,300 square feet for our formerly single-branded stores to approximately 7,400 square feet for our stores that consist of adjacent and connected Carter’s and OshKosh stores. As of the end of fiscal 2021, in the United States we operated 751 stores.
We regularly assess potential new retail store locations and closures based on demographic factors, retail adjacencies, competitive factors, and population density as part of a rigorous real estate portfolio optimization process.
We also sell our products through our U.S. eCommerce websites at www.carters.com, www.oshkoshbgosh.com, www.oshkosh.com, and www.skiphop.com, and our mobile application.
We focus on the customer experience through store and eCommerce website design, visual aesthetics, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service. Our eCommerce websites also feature product recommendations and on-line-only offerings. We strive to create a seamless omni-channel experience between our retail stores and our eCommerce websites, as more fully described below under “Our Customer and Marketing Strategy.”
U.S. Wholesale
Our U.S. Wholesale segment includes sales of our products to our U.S. wholesale customers.
Our Carter’s brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, buybuy BABY, Costco, Kohl’s, and Macy’s. Additionally, we sell our Child of Mine exclusive brand at Walmart, our Just One You exclusive brand at Target, and our Simple Joys exclusive brand on Amazon.
Our OshKosh brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Amazon, buybuy BABY, and Target.
Our Skip Hop brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Amazon, buybuy BABY, and Target.
We collaborate with our wholesale customers to provide a consistent and high-level of service, and to drive growth through eCommerce, replenishment, product mix, and brand presentation initiatives. We also have frequent meetings with the senior management of key accounts to align on strategic growth plans.
International
Our International segment includes sales of our products through our retail stores and eCommerce sites in Canada and Mexico. As of the end of fiscal 2021, in Canada we operated 186 co-branded Carter’s and OshKosh retail stores and an eCommerce site at www.cartersoshkosh.ca, and in Mexico we operated 43 retail stores and an eCommerce site at www.carter.com.mx.
Our International segment includes sales of our products to wholesale accounts outside of the United States, such as, in alphabetical order, Amazon, Costco, and Walmart. 
In addition, we license our Carter’s and OshKosh brands to international customers that sell our products through branded retail and online stores, as well as to wholesale customers, within their licensed territories. Our International segment includes sales of our products to these licensees, and royalty income based on sales made by certain licensees. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 38 international licensees who operated in over 90 countries.
Our Customer and Marketing Strategy
For all of our brands, our marketing is predominantly focused on driving brand preference and engagement with first-time parents, experienced parents, and gift-givers, including through strengthening and evolving our digital programs. Our omni-channel approach allows the customer to experience our brands as a seamless shopping experience in the channel of their choice. In fiscal 2019, we launched capabilities in the United States to allow our customers to buy on-line and pick-up in store, complementing our existing buy-on-line, ship-to-store and in-store buy on-line services. In fiscal 2020, we enhanced and expanded our omni-channel capabilities in the United States, including curbside pick-up at our retail stores and buy-on-line, deliver-from-store. In fiscal 2021, we expanded our omni-channel capabilities further by implementing omni-channel programs in our retail stores in Canada.
We operate our Rewarding Moments loyalty and rewards program in the United States to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty. This program is integrated across our U.S. retail stores and online businesses. During fiscal 2021, our U.S. retail sales were predominantly made to customers who are members of Rewarding Moments. 
In fiscal 2019, we launched a new Carter’s credit card program in the United States. The Carter’s credit card complements and enhances our existing Rewarding Moments loyalty program and provides new benefits for our customers, including free shipping on every eCommerce order, double Rewarding Moments points, and exclusive cardholder-only events.
Our investments in marketing, our loyalty program, and new consumer-facing technologies are focused on acquiring new customers, developing stronger relationships with our existing customers, and extending their connections with our brands. Our goal is to have the most top-of-mind, preferred brands in the young children’s apparel market and to connect with a diverse, digitally savvy customer.
Our Global Sourcing Network
We do not own any raw materials or manufacturing facilities. We source all of our garments and other products from a global network of third-party suppliers, primarily located in Asia. We source the remainder of our products primarily through North America, Africa, and Central America. During fiscal 2021, approximately 74% of our product was sourced from Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and China, and approximately 80% of the fabric that was used in the manufacture of our products was sourced from China, with the remainder primarily from Thailand and Taiwan.
Our sourcing operations are based in Hong Kong in order to facilitate better service and manage the volume of manufacturing in Asia. Our Hong Kong office acts as an agent for substantially all of our sourcing in Asia and monitors production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our manufacturing specifications and social responsibility standards, as well as timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities. We also have sourcing operations in Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and Bangladesh to help support these efforts.
Prior to placing production, and on a recurring basis, we conduct assessments of political, social, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products, and we conduct assessments of our 
manufacturers and supply chain, as discussed under “—Corporate Social Responsibility” below. In connection with the manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric and other materials (such as linings, zippers, buttons, and trim) at our direction. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to maintain quality control, monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications and social responsibility standards and to ensure timely delivery. We also inspect finished products at the manufacturing facilities.
We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against losses arising during shipping.
As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available.
We expect all of our suppliers shipping to the United States to adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program, including standards relating to facility security, procedural security, personnel security, cargo security, and the overall protection of the supply chain. In the event a supplier does not comply with our C-TPAT requirements, or if we have determined that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may move that supplier’s product through alternative supply chain channels or we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We have adopted a factory on-boarding program that allows us to assess each factory’s compliance with our social responsibility standards before we place orders for product with that factory, including factories utilized by companies that we may acquire. Additionally, we regularly assess the manufacturing facilities we use through periodic on-site facility inspections, including the use of independent auditors to supplement our internal staff. We use audit data and performance results to suggest improvements when necessary, and we integrate this information into our on-going sourcing decisions. Our vendor code of conduct, with which we require our factories to comply, outlines our standards for supplier behavior in creating a fair and safe workplace, and covers employment practices, such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age, and discriminatory practices, as well as environmental, ethical, and other legal matters. In addition, our social responsibility policy establishes our expectations for our global suppliers and guides our oversight. This policy is derived from the policies, standards, and conventions of the International Labor Organization, and includes a commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Our Global Distribution Network 
The majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third-party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment based upon needs, costs, and timing considerations.
In the United States, we operate two distribution centers in Georgia: an approximately 1.1 million square-foot multi-channel facility in Braselton and a 0.5 million square-foot facility in Stockbridge. We also outsource distribution activities to third-party logistics providers located in California. Our distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our vendors, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail and wholesale presentation, and shipping them to our wholesale customers, retail stores, and eCommerce customers.
Internationally, we operate directly or outsource our distribution activities to third-party logistics providers in Canada, China, Mexico, and Vietnam to support shipment to the United States, as well as our international wholesale accounts, international licensees, international eCommerce operations, and Canadian and Mexican retail store networks.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to laws, regulations and standards set by various governmental authorities around the world, including in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including: 
•those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”); 
•the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws; 
•health care, employment and labor laws; 
•product and consumer safety laws, including those imposed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
•data privacy laws, including the E.U. General Data Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act;
•trade, transportation and logistics related laws, including tariffs and orders issued by Customs and Border Protection; and
•applicable environmental laws.
A substantial portion of our products is imported into the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. The United States and other countries in which our products are sold may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels. We, therefore, actively monitor import restrictions and developments and seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through shifts of production among countries, including consideration of countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements, manufacturers, and geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
Additionally, we are subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations, and products, including data privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and eCommerce sites. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions.
Competition
The baby and young children’s apparel and accessories market is highly competitive. Competition is generally based on a variety of factors, including comfort and fit, quality, pricing, experience, and selection. Both branded and private label manufacturers as well as specialty apparel retailers aggressively compete in the baby and young children’s apparel market. Our primary competitors include (in alphabetical order): Gap, Old Navy, and The Children’s Place (specialty apparel); Cat & Jack and Garanimals (private label); and Disney, Nike, and Under Armour (national brands). Because of the highly fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many small manufacturers and retailers. We believe that the strength of our brand names, combined with our breadth and value of product offerings, longevity in the marketplace, distribution footprint, and operational expertise, position us well against these competitors.
Seasonality and Weather
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally have resulted in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half of the year. Accordingly, our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year. In addition, our business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could influence consumer trends, customer traffic, and shopping habits. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool temperatures during the summer season could affect the timing of, and reduce or shift, demand.
Human Capital Resources
As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 15,900 employees globally. Of these, approximately 12,200 of our employees worked in our retail stores across North America, 2,200 employees worked in our distribution centers, and 1,500 employees worked in our various corporate offices around the world. Approximately 13,000 employees worked in the United States, 2,200 employees worked in Canada, 350 employees worked in Mexico, and 350 employees worked in other countries, including Hong Kong. As of the end of fiscal 2021, approximately 150 employees were unionized employees, all of whom were in Mexico. We believe we have good labor relationships with our employees.
Talent and Development
Everything we do is guided by our core values:
•Act with Integrity
•Exceed Expectations
•Inspire Innovation
•Succeed Together
•Invest in People
We believe that to succeed as a business and to positively impact families and our communities, we must first create and maintain an inclusive, supportive workplace culture that fosters high employee engagement. We believe deeply in developing our employees and offer numerous formal training opportunities as well as ongoing informal on-the-job learning, including:
•mentoring, reverse mentoring, and executive development programs that nurture emerging talent and facilitate cross-generational knowledge sharing, benefiting employees at all stages of their careers;
•development days, when employees step away from their day-to-day responsibilities for curated professional growth opportunities;
•online courses and formal development programs designed to enhance personal leadership skills, business acumen, and people management skills, as well as specialized development resources for our retail store, distribution center and office employees; and
•each year, we award 20 scholarships to Carter’s employees and children of employees to attend an accredited college or university.
Diversity and Inclusion
Additionally, we are committed to ensuring that our workforce reflects our diverse world through a range of efforts to broaden diversity and ensure fairness across our global enterprise. Our Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”) efforts are driven by cross-functional teams charged with guiding and implementing the organization’s D&I efforts. These teams oversee our efforts to establish and improve inclusive policies in four key areas of our management processes: leadership, strategies and processes, programs and benefits, and policies and compliance. We continually measure and monitor diversity metrics including pay equity, retention, new hires, internal promotions and identified successors, and our D&I education equips employees with the tools and support needed to further enhance a workplace culture of inclusion.
Health and Safety
We maintain a safety culture with the goal of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We have created and implemented processes to help eliminate safety events by reducing their frequency and severity. We also review and monitor our performance closely. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and continue to implement safety measures in all our facilities to protect our customers and employees, including ensuring social distancing, frequent cleaning, and use of personal protective equipment for all in our retail stores, and maintaining safe working distances and conditions at our distribution centers.
