Item 1. Business
General
 
Aly Energy Services, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Aly Energy” or the “Company”), is a provider of oilfield services to leading oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies operating in unconventional plays in the United States (“U.S.”). Generally, the services we offer fall within two broad categories: surface rental and solids control. Our surface rental equipment includes a wide variety of large capacity tanks with circulating systems, associated pumps, separators, gas busters, mud mix plants and ancillary equipment. We also provide environmental containment berms to safeguard against spills from mud systems on the drilling rig site. Our solids control equipment includes large centrifuges, shakers, cuttings dryers and ancillary components that can be integrated into a closed loop mud system. We operate in the U.S., primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.
 
Throughout this report, we refer to Aly Energy and its subsidiaries as “we”, “our” or “us”.
 
History
 
On July 17, 2012, Munawar “Micki” Hidayatallah founded Aly Energy with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield services company that would serve E&P companies operating in unconventional plays. From 2012 through 2014, we grew our business substantially both through the strategic acquisition of certain businesses operating in our industry and through organic growth. We have fully integrated the completed acquisitions and we operate as a single provider which offers our customers a comprehensive solution for their drilling fluid management needs.
General Trends and Outlook
 
Our business depends to a significant extent on the level of unconventional resource development activity and corresponding capital spending by E&P companies onshore in the U.S. These activity and spending levels are strongly influenced by current and expected oil prices. Oil prices have been and will continue to be volatile as the major drivers determining the price of oil, including the rate of GDP growth in consuming nations and the political stability of oil-producing countries, are unpredictable. From 2016 throughout most of 2018, oil prices and the U.S. land-based drilling rig count (“Rig Count”), an indicator of overall drilling activity of our customers, steadily increased. As a result, we experienced increases in demand for our equipment and services when comparing 2018 to 2017.
 
Looking forward into the remainder of 2019, we believe oil prices will remain fairly stable at current levels, but we anticipate a potential decline in the Rig Count of up to 10% as E&P companies cut back on capital expenditures for drilling programs. In order to mitigate the impact of a declining Rig Count, we will focus on maintaining current pricing levels and increasing activity and utilization of our equipment, particularly with existing customers who are not reducing the number of rigs they operate.
 
We will continue to expand our business through a low risk strategy of growing organically by replacing our sub-rented equipment with newly purchased, refurbished or fabricated equipment. We will also evaluate transaction opportunities that would provide geographic diversification, expand our products and services and introduce us to new customers.

Recapitalization
 
In September 2016, certain of the Company’s principal stockholders formed Permian Pelican, Inc. (“Pelican”), formerly Permian Pelican, LLC, with the objective of consummating a recapitalization transaction (the “Recapitalization”) whereby (i) our obligations under our then existing credit facility and various capital leases would be restructured and, (ii) the Company’s then outstanding redeemable preferred stock, subordinated note payable and contingent payment liability would be exchanged into common stock resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt and other liabilities of $2.4 million. The Recapitalization, completed on January 31, 2017, had a significant impact on our capital structure and on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Products and Services
 
We are a provider of solids control systems and surface rental equipment. Our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in land-based horizontal drilling. Our equipment includes centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment, mud circulating tanks (400 and 500-barrel capacity) and auxiliary surface rental equipment (e.g. portable mud mixing plants, and containment systems). In conjunction with the rental of some of our solids control packages, we provide personnel at the customer’s well site to operate our equipment. We also provide personnel to rig-up/rig-down and haul our equipment to and from the customer's location.
Our Rental Products:
 
Centrifuges: We currently own over 45 centrifuges. We provide two different sizes of centrifuges to meet varying client specifications (SS1000 and SS2000). We believe our centrifuges provide a competitive advantage because the rotating assembly within each centrifuge can be removed and replaced on a customer’s well site within 45 minutes if it fails thereby minimizing downtime. Certain customers rent centrifuges with auxiliary equipment such as shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks.
Mud Circulating Tanks (“MCTs”): We currently own 54 vertical 400-barrel MCTs and 127 500-barrel MCTs. We developed vertical 400-barrel MCTs as an innovative solution that minimizes location size, which we believe is an attractive feature for customers. The majority of our 500-barrel MCTs are highly mobile with rounded bottoms and customized jet-lines to ensure more consistent mud and easier cleanout at the completion of a job. In addition to the 500-barrel MCTs we own, we sub-rent 500-barrel MCTs (approximately 240 sub-rented as of December 31, 2018) in order to satisfy demand for our services. MCTs are typically rented to customers with auxiliary equipment such as diesel or electric mud pumps, hoses, and wooden mats.
Mud Mixing Plants (“MMPs”): We own 12 MMPs ranging in size from 100-barrel capacity to 500-barrel capacity. We believe that the large 400-barrel and 500-barrel capacity MMPs, which are designed and fabricated in-house, are unique and offer significant advantages to our customers.
Containment Systems: Containment systems consist of berms and plastic linings constructed to ensure that all products and chemicals present on the well site, particularly those which might be environmentally undesirable if spilled, are contained. We believe the demand for containment systems will continue to increase as environmental regulations tighten.
Our Service Offerings Which Include Personnel:
 
Solids Control Services: When a customer’s solids control operations are complex, we provide operators on-site 24 hours a day at an additional day rate. In these instances, we typically rent a full package of solids control equipment to the customer, which may include two centrifuges, shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks. 
 
Hauling of Equipment and Rig-Up/Rig-Down Services: We offer hauling of our rental equipment to the well site and rig-up/rig-down of such equipment.

Fabricating Capabilities
 
We fabricate certain equipment in our rental fleet, including various pumps (diesel mud pumps, diesel transfer pumps, etc.), open top tanks and MMPs. Fabrication primarily takes place in our facility in Giddings, Texas. We believe our ability to fabricate such products in-house provides us with cost efficiencies that result in a competitive advantage. 
Geographic Markets
 
We operate in the U.S., primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Within these states, we have a very strong footprint in the Permian Basin, one of the largest and most prolific shale plays in the U.S., and we also provide services in the Scoop/Stack region and Eagle Ford shale.
Competition
 
We experience significant competition in our business. The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and there are a large number of companies in these markets offering rental equipment and services that overlap with our offerings. We believe the principal differentiators among competitors in the sectors and markets in which we operate are safety record, service quality, existence of unique attributes of equipment that benefit the customer, customer relationships, response time and price. 
 
The level of our revenue, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.

 
Customers
 
We cultivate and maintain strong relationships with our customers which include some of the largest independent oil and gas E&P companies operating in the U.S. shale basins. During 2018, we serviced 49 customers, including leading companies such as EOG Resources, Inc., Pioneer Natural Resources, XTO Energy Inc., Sanchez Oil and Gas Corporation and Devon Energy Corporation.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our significant customers, customers which individually generate more than 10.0% of our revenue, collectively represented approximately 62.5% and 56.3% of our revenue, respectively.
 
If we are unable to continue to provide services to our primary customers and sales to new or other existing customers do not increase sufficiently, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
Raw Materials
 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. 

Safety
 
Our record and reputation for safety is important to all aspects of our business. In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger customers have placed an added emphasis on the safety records and quality management systems of their vendors.
 
We commit substantial resources toward employee safety and quality management. We believe our policies and procedures provide a solid framework to ensure our employees minimize the hazards inherent in our work environment, meet regulatory requirements and exceed customer expectations.
 
Employees
 
As of March 8, 2019, we employed approximately 58 individuals. The corporate cost center employs five individuals, including the chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, approximately 47 individuals work primarily in the field, and the remaining six employees provide selling, general, and administrative services. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Seasonality
 
We have historically experienced a slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons and demand in the fourth quarter sometimes slows as our customers exhaust their annual spending budgets.

Intangibles
 
We are not dependent on any significant patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. In the last two years, we have not spent or incurred a material amount on research and development activities.
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is impacted by federal, state and local laws and other regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on us, our business or financial condition.
 
In addition, our customers are impacted by laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers’ activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers’ activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.

Access to Company Reports
 
We make available, free of charge, on our website, www.alyenergy.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports on the same day as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
