Item 1.  Business 
Overview
 
Crossroads Liquidating Trust (the “Liquidating Trust” or the “Trust”) operates as a statutory trust under the general laws of the State of Maryland following the conversion of Crossroads Capital, Inc. (“Crossroads Capital”) into Crossroads Liquidating Trust pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”).  The sole purpose of the Trust is the liquidation of its assets and distribution of its proceeds to the holders of the beneficial interests in the Liquidating Trust. 
 
Prior to conversion, Crossroads Capital, Inc. (“Crossroads Capital”) elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).  On June 23, 2017, Crossroads Capital and each of the trustees of the Liquidating Trust (the “Trustees”) executed the Liquidating Trust Agreement (the “Liquidating Trust Agreement”) in connection with the conversion of Crossroads Capital into Crossroads Liquidating Trust pursuant to the Plan.  On June 23, 2017, Crossroads Capital filed Articles of Conversion with the State of Maryland and all of the assets and liabilities of Crossroads Capital became assets and liabilities of the Trust (the “Conversion”).  Stockholders of Crossroads Capital received one unit of beneficial interest for each share of common stock held by such stockholder on the date of conversion. 
 
The Liquidating Trust will terminate upon payment to the holders of the beneficial interests in the Liquidating Trust (“Trust Units”) of all the Liquidating Trust’s assets and in any event upon the third anniversary of the effectiveness of the Conversion.  The life of the Liquidating Trust may, however, be extended to more than three years if the Trustees then determine that an extension is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Trust.  The Trustees are authorized to engage the services of other professionals or service organizations to assist in managing the Liquidating Trust’s affairs.  Under the Liquidating Trust Agreement, Trust Units are not transferable or assignable, except for certain exceptions described in the Liquidating Trust Agreement.  The Trust Units are not certificated, listed on any exchange or quoted on any quotation system.  The Liquidating Trust Agreement provides that neither the Trustees nor anyone associated with the Liquidating Trust may take any action to facilitate or encourage any trading in the Trust Units.  The Liquidating Trust’s activities are specifically limited to conserving, protecting and selling its assets and distributing the proceeds therefrom. These activities include holding the Liquidating Trust’s assets for the benefit of the holders of the Trust Units and enforcing their rights, temporarily investing asset sale proceeds and collecting income therefrom, providing for the liabilities of the Liquidating Trust, making liquidating distributions to the holders of Trust Units, and taking such other actions as may be necessary to conserve and protect the assets of the Liquidating Trust.  
 
The Liquidating Trust remains subject to the restrictions under the 1940 Act from engaging in transactions with affiliated parties, except under certain circumstances.  The Liquidating Trust is required to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) annual reports showing the assets and liabilities of the Liquidating Trust at the end of each calendar year and its receipts and disbursements for the period.  The annual reports will describe the changes in the Liquidating Trust’s assets during the reporting period and the actions taken by the Trustees during the period.  The financial statements contained in such reports will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and will be reviewed by the Liquidating Trust’s independent registered public accounting firm. The financial statements, however, will not be audited.  The Liquidating Trust will file with the SEC a Form 8-K whenever an event occurs that requires such a report to be filed for or whenever, in the opinion of the Trustees, any other material event relating to the Liquidating Trust has occurred. 
 
Distributions
 
The Plan provides that liquidating distributions will be made at such times as determined by the Trustees in their sole discretion. Consideration of potential liquidating distributions shall occur no less frequently than annually and in any event within a reasonable period of time following the disposition of the Liquidating Trust’s assets. 
 
The Trust did not make any liquidating distributions during 2018.
 
On July 12, 2017, the Trust made an initial liquidating distribution of $1.60 per Trust Unit to the holders of beneficial interest in the Trust, pursuant to the Plan.  This initial liquidating distribution was apportioned pro rata according to the beneficial unit holders’ respective interest in the Trust. 
 
Tax Treatment
 
For Federal income tax purposes, the Trust is treated as a “grantor” trust.  As such, the Trust itself is not subject to federal or state income tax.  Instead, each beneficiary will be treated as having a direct interest in an allocable pro rata share of each asset and liability of the Trust.  As a result, an allocable portion of all items of Trust income (including any gains and losses recognized by the Trust), deductions and credits must be reported by beneficiaries on their income tax return(s).

The Trust will issue an annual information statement to its beneficiaries with information for their tax returns. Beneficiaries are urged to consult with their tax advisers as to their own filing requirements and the appropriate tax reporting of this information on their returns.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees or executive officers.  All of our work is performed by the Trustees directly or through contract services.  1100 Capital Consulting, LLC (the “Administrator”) serves as our administrator, performing the administrative services necessary for our operation, including without limitation, providing equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, accounting and record keeping services.
