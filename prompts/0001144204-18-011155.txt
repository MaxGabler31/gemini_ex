 Competitive Strengths / Business Strategies 
 We believe our financial strength and flexibility, coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low, highly variable cost structure, producing a diversified value-added product offering, controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals, fostering an entity-wide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team and work force, positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position and execute our growth strategy.   One of the Lowest Cost Steel Producers in the United States; State-of-the-Art Facilities / Continue to Maintain Low Production Costs
 We are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the North American steel industry. Our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations, our high productivity rate, low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material, ferrous scrap.
 We will continue to drive innovative ways to use our equipment, enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities. As one of the lowest cost producers in each of our three primary operating segments, we are able to better manage through cyclical and non-cyclical downturns, and to consistently maximize our profitability. We continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs. Our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance. Performance-based incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient and safe use of physical resources and capital employed. Additionally, leveraging our existing facilities through capital effective organic growth and diversified product offerings allows us to maximize utilization of our current cost structure. 
 ﻿
 Secure Supply of High Quality Just-in-Time Ferrous Raw Materials 
 ﻿
 We maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations and Iron Dynamics (IDI). Ferrous materials represent the single largest raw material component of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs, at approximately 60% of such costs. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, OmniSource, our metals recycling operations, provided our steel operations with 38%, 40%, and 41%, respectively, of its ferrous scrap requirements. This represented 63%, 61%, and 54% of OmniSource’s total ferrous scrap shipments during 2017,   
 
3


 
2016, and 2015, respectively. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, our steel operations consumed 10.3 million, 9.9 million, and 8.8 million tons, respectively, of metallic materials, of which iron units, other than scrap, represented approximately 13%, 14%, and 12% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. IDI supplies 100% of its production to the Butler Flat Roll Division, representing 72%, 65%, and 66% of their iron units other than scrap in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, through the transfer of liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron, which are higher quality, energy-saving ferrous raw materials. We believe our metals recycling operations and IDI provide us with a high quality, cost effective, and secure raw material platform for effective working capital management.    
 ﻿
 Diversified Product Mix / Expanded Product Offerings
 We are one of the most diversified steel companies in the United States, with very broad product offerings. We currently offer a broad range of steel products (more specifically enumerated in the Steel Operations Products and Sales by End Market later in this section), including: Steel Operations:
 Sheet Products. Hot roll, cold roll and coated steel, including a wide variety of specialty products, such as light gauge hot roll, galvanized, galvanneal, Galvalume®, Galfan®, and painted products. 
 Long Products.  Structural steel beams, pilings, and standard and premium grade rail; engineered special-bar-quality of an expanding range of sizes and chemistries; various merchant-bar products including rounds, angles, flats, channels and reinforcing bar, and channels and specialty steel sections.
 Steel Finishing. Turning, polishing, straightening, chamfering, threading, precision saw-cutting, cold draw and heat treating of bar products; and cutting to length, additional straightening, hole punching, shot blasting, welding and coating of beams, channels and specialty steel sections.
 Metals Recycling Operations. An array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing, scrap management, transportation, and brokerage products and services.
 Steel Fabrication Operations. Steel joists and steel deck material, including specialty deck.
 This diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of end-user markets, serve a broad customer base, and help mitigate our market exposure to any one product or end-user market, resulting in increased utilization. In addition, our value-added product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products supplied by other domestic steel, and to a larger extent in recent years, foreign manufacturers.
 We will continue to seek additional opportunities and to collaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and offerings, which may allow our customers the ability to more effectively and efficiently navigate their supply chain. One such opportunity is our soon to be completed $28 million investment at our Roanoke Bar Division, to utilize existing excess melting and casting capability with the addition of a rolling line to add approximately 200,000 tons annually of reinforcing bar capacity, including multi-strand slitting and finishing. Another opportunity is our on-going $75 million investment at our Structural and Rail Division to utilize excess melting and casting capability to produce up to 240,000 tons of various sizes of reinforcing bar including custom cut-to-length, smooth bar, and coiled.    Strategic Geographic Locations / Enter New Geographic Markets
 The majority of our steelmaking facilities are in locations near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base, allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers. This also allows us to provide consistent on-time delivery to our customer base with relatively short lead times, further enhancing our customer relationships. Our coated sheet steel products are also effectively available through our locations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Jeffersonville, Indiana and Columbus, Mississippi, due to river access.  Recycled ferrous scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing. We believe that our metals recycling facilities are in the regions that account for a majority of the total ferrous scrap produced in the United States. Our steel fabrication operations have a national footprint allowing us to serve the entire joist and deck domestic market and national accounts. 
 We may seek to enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities within our areas of expertise.
 Experienced Management Team and Unique Corporate Culture / Foster Entrepreneurial Culture
 Our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication industries. Management’s objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performance‑based compensation programs that are correlated to the company’s profitability and operational performance in relationship to its steel manufacturing peers. Our entrepreneurial culture resonates throughout each of our operating segments. We emphasize decentralized decision making, with corporate risk oversight, and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts toward identifying innovative ways to enhance productivity, improve profitability, and control costs.

Steel Operations Segment

  ﻿
 Steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills, producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, utilizing continuous casting, automated rolling mills and several downstream steel coating and bar processing lines, and IDI, our liquid pig iron production facility, that supplies solely the Butler Flat Roll Division. Our steel operations sell directly to end-users, steel fabricators, and service centers. These products are used in numerous industry sectors, including the construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including OCTG) markets. Our steel operations accounted for 72% of our consolidated net sales during 2017 and 2016, and 69% in 2015. We are predominantly a domestic steel company, with only 5%, 4%, and 5% of our revenues generated from exported sales during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.    Our steel operations consist primarily of steelmaking and coating operations. The following chart summarizes the locations and the current estimated production capacities of our facilities:    ﻿

SHEET STEEL PRODUCTS
 Our sheet steel products, consisting of hot roll, cold roll and coated steel products are produced by our Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Divisions, and our several downstream coating lines, including The Techs. Our sheet steel operations represented 71%, 70%, and 65% of steel operations net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We produced 7.1 million, 6.9 million, and 6.0 million tons of sheet steel at these facilities in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 IDI produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron (HBI) that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes directly into our Butler Flat Roll Division electric arc furnaces to produce steel. IDI’s primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production, due to the inherent economic benefits achieved at the steel mill when the material is used in the steelmaking process, such as reduced energy cost, reduced materials cost, and quicker melting cycles. During 2017 and 2016, respectively, IDI produced 259,000 and 255,000 metric tons, of which 90% and 98%, respectively, was liquid pig iron. We have used, and plan to continue to use, all of the facility’s output internally.
 ﻿
 The following chart summarizes the types of sheet steel products sold by sales dollars, during the respective years:

 Customers. Steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary sheet steel producers and the many end-user manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils. The additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling, galvanizing, cutting to length, slitting to size, leveling, blanking, shape correcting, edge rolling, shearing and stamping. We believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base. The Columbus Flat Roll Division allows us to capitalize on the industrial markets in the Southern United States and Mexico, as well as further expand our customer base in painted, and line and other pipe products. Galvanized flat roll products produced by our Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Divisions, and The Techs are similar and are sold to a similar customer base. However, The Techs specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in primarily non-automotive applications, servicing a variety of customers in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), construction, agriculture and consumer goods markets. Our sheet steel operations also provide a significant portion of the sheet steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations.

 ﻿
 LONG PRODUCTS
 Our Structural and Rail Division is capable of producing a variety of parallel flange sections such as Wide Flange Beams, American Standard Beams, Manufactured Housing Beams, and H Piling and Channel sections for the construction, transportation and industrial machinery markets. Further diversification of the product mix occurred in 2017, to include flat bars and large unequal leg angles used in construction markets. They also produce standard strength carbon, intermediate alloy hardness, and premium grade rails in 40 to 320 feet length for the railroad industry. Our state-of-the-art heat treating system allows us to produce high quality premium rail, which has been certified by all Class I railroads. In addition, our rail-welding facility has the ability to weld (Continuous Welded Rail) in lengths up to 1,600 feet, which offers substantial savings to the railroads both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance. We are currently constructing a $75 million expansion to utilize existing excess melting and casting capability to produce up to 240,000 tons of various sizes of reinforcing bar including custom cut-to-length, smooth bar, and coiled.
 Our Engineered Bar Products Division is capable of producing a broad array of engineered special-bar-quality (SBQ), merchant-bar-quality (MBQ), rounded-cornered squares, and smaller-diameter engineered round bars. Adjacent to this mill, we have a bar finishing facility, which provides various downstream finishing operations for our SBQ steel bars. Processing operations include turning, polishing, straightening, chamfering, precision saw-cutting and heat-treating capabilities. In addition, non-destructive testing services are available, including eddy current, flux leakage and ultrasonic inspection. Vulcan Threaded Products, Inc. (Vulcan), produces threaded rod product, and cold drawn and heat treated bar, creating strategic pull-through demand of special-bar-quality products provided from our Engineered Bar Products Division.  
 Our Roanoke Bar Division primarily produces merchant bar products, including angles, merchant rounds, flats, channels, and reinforcing bar. We expect in early 2018 to complete our $28 million rolling line expansion project to utilize existing excess melting and casting capability to produce approximately 200,000 tons of reinforcing bar, with multi-strand slitting and finishing capabilities, making us the largest independent reinforcing bar producer in the region. 
 Steel of West Virginia primarily sells beams, channels and specialty steel sections, and frequently performs fabrication and finishing operations on its products, such as cutting to length, additional straightening, hole punching, shot blasting, welding, coating, and new in 2017 galvanizing. Through this additional finishing, we create custom finished products that are generally placed directly into our customers’ assembly operations.

  ﻿
 Customers. The principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers, steel fabricators and various manufacturers. Service centers, though not the ultimate end-user, provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers, including small quantity sales, repackaging, cutting, preliminary processing and warehousing. The steel rail marketplace in the United States, Canada and Mexico is specialized and defined, with seven Class I railroads and a large distribution network. 
 SBQ products are principally consumed by cold finishers, forgers, intermediate processors, OEM manufacturers, steel service centers, and distributors, as well as pull through volume to Vulcan. Our MBQ products are sold primarily to steel service centers, as well as reinforcing bar distributors, joist producers, and OEMs. Some of the excess steel billet production at the Roanoke Bar Division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities, including our Steel of West Virginia facility. Our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from Roanoke Bar Division. Steel of West Virginia’s customers are primarily OEMs producing truck trailers, industrial lift trucks, merchant products, guardrail posts, manufactured housing, mining, and off-highway construction equipment. Steel of West Virginia’s flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of custom-ordered and designed products. Many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume end-uses resulting in a wide variety of customers, the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries.  
 Steel Competition. The markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in the carbon steel industry from North American and foreign integrated and mini-mill steelmaking and processing operations.  We compete in numerous industry sections, most significantly tied to the construction, automotive, and other manufacturing sectors.  In many applications within these industry sections, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, plastics, carbon fiber, glass and wood.  Some of our products are commodities, subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand.  However, we are focused on providing a broader range of diversified value-added products that de-emphasize commodity steel. The primary competitive influences on products we sell are price, quality and value-added services.
 Global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products.  Such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices, and sometimes at or below their cost to produce.  Excessive imports of steel in the United States, such as in 2017 and more so in 2015, intensifies price competition on the domestic steel industry which negatively affects our ability to increase our selling prices, and realize higher margins and profitability.

· | Retail individuals who sell material directly to our facilities, which they collect from a variety of sources.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources.  Market demand and the composition, quality, size, weight, and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices.
 Products. Our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase, processing, and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades.  We process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods, including sorting, shredding, shearing, cutting, torching, baling, briquetting, and breaking. Our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel, busheling, bundled scrap, shredded scrap and other scrap metal products, such as steel turnings and cast iron. These products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness, size of individual pieces, and residual alloys. The necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value. We process various grades of nonferrous products, including aluminum, brass, copper, stainless steel, and other nonferrous metals. Additionally, we provide transportation logistics (truck, rail, and river barge), marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services.
 Customers. We sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to end-users, such as electric arc furnace steel mills, integrated steelmakers, foundries, secondary smelters, and metal brokers, who aggregate materials for other large users. Ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces, such as our steel mills. Most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month. The price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing, transportation costs, as well as the quality and grade of the scrap. We sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to end-users such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries, mills, smelters, specialty steelmakers, alloy manufacturers, wire and cable producers, utilities, and telephone networks.  The price we charge for nonferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing, transportation costs, as well as the quality and grade of the scrap.
 Competition. Scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout Asia, Europe and North America. The markets for scrap metals are highly competitive, both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap, and the sale of processed scrap. With regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap, we compete with numerous independent recyclers, as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap. In many cases, we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors. Successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap. Both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets, which are affected, sometimes significantly, by relative economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price, quality, and location of the scrap metals, as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery.
 We also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products, such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills, some of which like us are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business. In addition, other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers. Scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap, such as pre-reduced iron pellets, HBI, pig iron, direct reduced iron (DRI), and other forms of processed iron. The availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices and/or lower demand for our scrap products.
 The industry is highly fragmented with many smaller family-owned companies, many regional scrap companies, along with a number of national and global companies, each of which has multiple locations in areas in which OmniSource also operates. No single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market.

Steel Fabrication Operations Segment

  ﻿
 Our steel fabrication operations include seven New Millennium Building Systems plants that primarily serve the non-residential construction industry throughout the United States.  We have a national operating footprint that allows us to serve the entire domestic construction market, as well as national accounts, such as large retail chains. 
 Steel fabrication operations accounted for 9% of our consolidated net sales during 2017, 2016, and 2015. We sold 627,000, 563,000, and 493,000 tons of joist and deck products during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our steel operations supply a substantial portion, approximately 51%, 59% and 63% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of the steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations, providing strategic pull-through demand.  
 Products. Our steel fabrication operations produce steel building components, including steel joists, girders, trusses (six locations), and steel deck (five locations). Our joist products include bowstring, arched, scissor, double‑pitched and single‑pitched joists. Our deck products include a full range of steel roof, form, composite floor, specialty architectural, floor systems, and bridge deck.
 Customers and Markets. Our primary steel fabrication operations customers are non-residential steel fabricators. Other customers include metal building companies, general construction contractors, developers, brokers and governmental entities.  Our customers are located throughout the United States, including national accounts. The steel joist and deck market in the United States was approximately 2.0 million, 1.9 million tons, and 1.7 million tons in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, based on trade association estimates. Based on this information, our steel fabrication operations’ growth rate has outpaced the steel joist and deck market growth resulting in our market share of approximately 33% in 2017, and 31% in 2016 and 2015. We believe we are well positioned with our national footprint to continue to grow as the non-residential construction market continues to expand, and we have available capacity that can be deployed as needed.
 Competition. We compete with other North American joist and steel deck producers primarily on the basis of price, quality, customer service, and proximity to the customer.  Our national footprint allows us to service the entire domestic non-residential construction market, as well as national accounts such as large retail chains, and certain specialty deck customers.

 Sources, Availability, and Cost of Steel and Other Operations’ Raw Materials
 Scrap Metals. The principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from, among other sources “home scrap”, generated internally at steel mills themselves; industrial scrap, generated as a by-product of manufacturing; and “obsolete” scrap recycled from end-of-life automobiles, appliances, railroad cars and railroad track materials, agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures, containers and machines.
 Ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80% of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking, in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking, where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25% to 35%. Depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time, and the relative cost of such material, the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix.
 Many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices, all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation. These factors include the level of domestic steel production (high quality low-residual scrap is a by-product of steel manufacturing activity), the level of exports of scrap from the United States, and the amount of obsolete scrap production. In addition, domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing. Generally, as domestic steel demand increases, so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices. The reverse is also normally, but not always, true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand. Scrap prices declined sharply in 2015 due to domestic scrap competition, the strong United States dollar tempering scrap exports, decreasing global pig iron prices, and lower steel mill utilization rates resulting from excessive record levels of steel imports. These excess sheet steel imports declined during 2016 with duties levied pursuant to the trade case rulings from the United States International Trade Commission, resulting in increased domestic steel mill utilization, resulting in improved scrap pricing. Steel imports once again rose during 2017, mostly related to structural and pre-fabricated structural long products, but also cold roll and coated sheet steel, causing pressure on steel selling prices in those markets.  However, scrap prices continued to climb in 2017 due to strong domestic steel mill utilization and lower scrap exports, combined with additional supply from DRI projects and prime scrap. When scrap prices greatly accelerate, this can challenge one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material.
 The following table provides pricing per gross ton from American Metal Market (AMM) and Ryan’s Notes (Pig Iron) estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production:

Iron Units. In addition to scrap, DRI, HBI, pig iron, and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production. During 2017, 2016, and 2015, we consumed 10.3 million, 9.9 million and 8.8 million tons, respectively, of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces, of which, iron units other than scrap, represented approximately 13%, 14% and 12% of the tons, respectively. Of these iron substitute units consumed, our IDI operation supplies 100% of its production to the Butler Flat Roll Division mill, representing 72%, 65% and 66% of their iron units in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.    Energy Resources
 Electricity.  Electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations (excluding The Techs and Vulcan), representing 6%, 7% and 6% of steel production costs of goods sold in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, Roanoke Bar Division and Steel of West Virginia, while our Engineered Bar Products Division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services (demand charge, energy charge, riders, etc.). Our Structural and Rail Division purchases electricity at current market prices and through forward contracts at fixed prices.

  Research and Development
 Our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand, develop and improve our products and operating processes, and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through IDI. Most of these research and development efforts have been conducted in-house by our employees.  Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local, state, and federal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and secondary materials. Our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water or the use and handling of by-products in order to operate our facilities. We dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal and state laws concerning the environment.  While we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, this is subject to change in the ever-evolving regulatory environment in which we operate.
 Since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures, our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future. In addition, due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments, the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated. The cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place United States steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers, which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations.

Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, which governs the treatment, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or United States EPA, and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases. RCRA also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup. Our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to RCRA. Our operations produce various by-products, some of which, for example electric arc furnace or EAF dust, are often categorized as hazardous waste, requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics. We collect such by-products in pollution control equipment, such as baghouses, and either recycle or appropriately dispose of these by-products. While we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties, the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities, the costs of which could be substantial.
 Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability, known as “CERCLA” or “Superfund,” the United States EPA and, in some instances, private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste, current and former site owners and operators, transporters and other potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to CERCLA and to the United States EPA. We have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our electric arc furnace dust and certain other by-products of our operations. However, we cannot assure that, even if there has been no fault by us, we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our by-products were transported.
 The Clean Water Act and similar state laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater, storm water and dredged or fill material.  United States EPA, states and, in certain instances, private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages.  The Clean Water Act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations.
 The Clean Air Act and analogous state laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate.  Air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment. Enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the United States EPA, the states, and in certain instances private parties, and can result in penalties and injunctive relief.
 In addition, there are a number of other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations. By way of example and not of limitation, certain portions of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, Oil Pollution Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies, apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations. In some instances, we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws. Many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations. Finally, our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance, negligence, trespass, infliction of emotional distress, or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage.
 Employees
 We emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility and have established performance-based incentive compensation programs specifically designed to enhance productivity, improve profitability, control costs and foster innovation. Our work force consisted of approximately 7,635 full time employees at December 31, 2017, of which approximately 9% were represented by collective bargaining agreements. The largest group of unionized employees is at Steel of West Virginia. The remaining unionized employees are located in four different OmniSource metals recycling locations, each of which has its own agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
