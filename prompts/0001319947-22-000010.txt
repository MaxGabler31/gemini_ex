ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
Designer Brands Inc., originally founded as DSW Inc., is one of North America's largest designers, producers, and retailers of footwear and accessories. We operate in three reportable segments: the U.S. Retail segment, the Canada Retail segment, and the Brand Portfolio segment. The U.S. Retail segment operates the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse ("DSW") banner through its direct-to-consumer U.S. stores and e-commerce site. The Canada Retail segment operates The Shoe Company and DSW banners through its direct-to-consumer Canada stores and e-commerce sites. Together, the U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments are referred to as the "retail segments." The Brand Portfolio segment earns revenue from the sale of wholesale products to retailers, commissions for serving retailers as the design and buying agent for products under private labels (which we refer to as "First Cost"), and the sale of branded products through our direct-to-consumer e-commerce site at www.vincecamuto.com. 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. References to a fiscal year (e.g., "2021") refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year begins. This reporting schedule is followed by many national retail companies and typically results in a 52-week fiscal year, but occasionally will contain an additional week resulting in a 53-week fiscal year. 
RETAIL SEGMENTS
BANNERS
We offer a wide assortment of brand name dress, casual and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids, with a significant number of our products geared towards athletic and kids.
•DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse- Our DSW banner, which is offered both in the U.S. and in Canada, is the destination for on-trend and fashion-forward footwear and accessory brands at a great value every single day, offering a wide assortment of brand name dress, casual and athletic footwear and accessories for women, men and kids. 
•The Shoe Company- The Shoe Company banner in Canada offers on-trend footwear and accessory brands that target every-day family styles at a great value every single day. 
Our e-commerce platforms offer customers convenient, 24/7 access to our products through our websites, www.dsw.com, www.dsw.ca, and www.theshoecompany.ca, with mobile-optimized sites, and our mobile DSW application. Our omni-channel capabilities allow customers to order a wide range of styles, sizes, widths and categories. Online orders in the U.S. and Canada can be fulfilled from any one of our stores. Online orders from the U.S. can also be fulfilled from our fulfillment center or directly from our suppliers (referred to as "drop ship"). Our order routing optimization system determines the best location to fulfill digitally demanded products, which allows us to optimize our operating profit. To further meet customer demand of how they receive products, we provide our customers options to Buy Online Pick Up in Store, Buy Online Ship to Store, and Curbside Pickup in the majority of our locations. Likewise, returns may be shipped to us or brought back to any of our locations.
ASSORTMENT
We sell a large assortment of brand name, designer and exclusive branded merchandise. During 2020 and continuing into 2021, we experienced a shift in customer preferences from dress toward casual and athletic offerings (referred to as "athleisure"). We plan to continue to expand our athleisure and kids’ products, and offer customers stylish exclusive brands, including the Vince Camuto, Lucky, JLO Jennifer Lopez, and Jessica Simpson brands. We believe that our increased penetration in the athletic market, coupled with our historical success in dress and seasonal footwear with a fully integrated supply chain supported by our Brand Portfolio segment, position us to be a premier footwear retailer for the entire family's needs over the long term.

DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT
For our U.S. Retail segment operations, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio and a West Coast facility operated by a third party, where the inventory is then processed, sorted, and shipped to one of our pool locations located throughout the country and then on to the stores. Our inventory can also be shipped directly from our fulfillment center, also located in Columbus, Ohio, and supported by a third-party service provider, to our customers. For our Canada Retail segment, we engage a logistics service provider to receive and distribute inventory to our stores. Through our ship-from-store capability, both in the U.S. and in Canada, inventory is shipped directly from our stores to customers. Through our U.S. drop ship program, inventory is shipped from the vendor's warehouse directly to the customer. 
Inventory management is important to our business as we manage our inventory levels based on anticipated sales and the delivery requirements of our customers. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our efficiency over the long term by enhancing systems and processes.
BRAND PORTFOLIO SEGMENT
Our Brand Portfolio segment designs, develops, and sources in-season fashion footwear and accessories through Camuto LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary doing business as "Camuto Group," for the sale of wholesale merchandise to our retail segments and our other retailer customers. Our First Cost model earns commission-based income for serving retailers as their design and buying agent while leveraging our overall design and sourcing infrastructure. In addition, we sell branded products on a direct-to-consumer e-commerce site at www.vincecamuto.com. Refer to Note 2, Revenue, of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for the Brand Portfolio segments' total net sales attributable to each channel. The Brand Portfolio segment has four customers that make up approximately 57% of its total net sales, excluding intersegment net sales, and the loss of any or all of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Brand Portfolio segment.

LICENSING RIGHTS
Through Camuto Group, we own the footwear, and in some cases the handbag, licensing rights of Jessica Simpson, Lucky Brand, and, through a joint venture, JLO Jennifer Lopez. In partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we have a 40% stake in ABG-Camuto, LLC ("ABG-Camuto"), a joint venture that owns several intellectual property rights, including, among others, Vince Camuto and Louise et Cie. ABG-Camuto is responsible for the growth and marketing of the brands held by the joint venture. We have entered into a licensing agreement with ABG-Camuto whereby we pay royalties to ABG-Camuto, with the royalty expense included in our cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations, based on the sales of licensed products, subject to guaranteed minimums. ABG-Camuto also earns royalties on sales from third parties that license the brand names to produce non-footwear product categories. Given our 40% ownership interest in ABG-Camuto, we recognize earnings under the equity method, included within the Brand Portfolio segment as it is considered an integral part of the Brand Portfolio segment business. 
SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION
We source each of our product lines based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products. Our Brand Portfolio segment does not own or operate manufacturing facilities; rather, we use our sourcing offices in China and Brazil to procure our products from third-party manufacturers. Prior to production, our sourcing offices inspect samples and prototypes of each style and monitor the quality of the production process. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders and anticipated sales. 
The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, local compliance, safety, and other standard requirements. These vendors are expected to respect local laws, rules, and regulations of the countries in which they operate and have pledged to follow the standards set forth in the Company's Vendor Code of Conduct, which details our dedication to human rights, labor rights, environmental responsibility, and workplace safety. The majority of our wholesale inventory is shipped directly from factories in foreign countries to our distribution center in Westampton, New Jersey, where the inventory is then processed, sorted, and provided to our customers' shipping carriers.
The following table presents the percentages of the Brand Portfolio segment's merchandise units sourced by country: 

 | 2021 | | 2020
China | 75 | % | | 73 | %
Vietnam | 9 | % | | 13 | %
Brazil | 11 | % | | 7 | %
All other foreign locations | 5 | % | | 7 | %

COMPETITION
The footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers, and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with owned and licensed brands that are well known.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
We believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our success. Our associates strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our customers. One of our core strategies is to invest in and support our associates who are key to differentiating our products and experiences in the competitive footwear market. We monitor and adapt as necessary to maintain our competitive position, including the following areas of focus:
WORKFORCE
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are aimed to:
•develop associates to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future;

•enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive;
•acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce;

TOTAL REWARDS
To remain an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we continually assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation practices, benefit programs, and other associate resources.

We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving associate performance, engagement, and retention. During 2021, over 11,800 associates completed one of our over 280 courses via our online learning platform. We believe that our continued focus on frequent and constructive performance feedback, talent reviews, succession planning, and retention, have contributed to a strong internal promotion rate.
PHILANTHROPY THROUGH DBI GIVES
The Company is committed to good corporate citizenship. Not only do we strive to create positive impacts within our organization, but we aim to better the communities in which we conduct business. DBI Gives is our philanthropic community interest group whose mission is to inspire community involvement and enhance associate engagement and has three main areas of focus:
1.Empowerment- Support organizations that prioritize empowerment and build self-confidence without discrimination.
2.Diversity, Equity & Inclusion- Support organizations whose key constituents align with the diversity dimensions represented by our Business Resource Groups ("BRGs").
3.Community- The places where our associates live and work mean everything to us. As a result, we support the organizations that put our local communities first and provide opportunities for our associates to give back through volunteering and donations.
DBI Gives has three primary areas of partnership: 
1.SOLES4SOULS- Soles4Souls creates sustainable jobs and provides relief through the distribution of shoes and clothing around the world, while keeping them out of landfills and giving shoes and garments a second life. Since partnering with Soles4Souls in 2018, we are proud to have donated nearly six million pairs of shoes, including more than 1.8 million pairs donated in 2021.
2.Two Ten Footwear Foundation- Two Ten provides scholarships and financial aid to people working in the footwear industry, as well as free counseling and community resources. Many of our own associates have been beneficiaries of Two Ten's programs. We support Two Ten with corporate financial donations and subject matter expertise to continue to enrich their community program offerings.
3.Hometown Partnerships- From annual United Way fundraisers, American Red Cross blood drives, local nonprofit partnerships, and associate volunteering efforts, we always look for ways to help and better the communities in which we operate. In 2021, we received the Dale. E Heydlauff United Way Legacy Award for Outstanding Philanthropy Leadership from Columbus Business First, for the new and innovative partnerships we forged through our point-of-sale campaigns and the creation of the Equity Advancement Fund at United Way of Central Ohio. Through our register donations, during 2021, we also raised nearly $200,000 for Nationwide Children’s Hospital’s "On Your Sleeves" program to advance their goal of providing free mental health education resources to children in all communities across the U.S. 
DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION ("DE&I") 
We support diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe:
•Diversity is the celebration of the ways we are alike, as well as unique.
•Equity compels us to be fair, while also recognizing the need to treat others differently to mitigate the risk of inadvertently perpetuating systemic barriers.
•Inclusion is the act of ensuring our differences are not only acknowledged, but also welcomed and valued.
We strive to inspire self-expression, authenticity, and empowerment to drive the best possible experiences for our associates, customers, and communities. Formal ways for associates, on a voluntary basis, to get involved and help advance our DE&I strategy include: 
•BRGs are associate-led groups organized around a common diversity dimension to foster an inclusive, engaging work environment for all. 
•Community Interest Groups ("CIGs") are associate-led groups based on a common passion or interest to drive a sense of community and shared purpose. 
•Councils are associate-led groups organized to create a sense of inclusion and belonging for those who work in our stores, distribution centers, and fulfillment center. 
No group is exclusive; all groups are open to any associate who wants to join, and associates can be members of as many groups as they want. Our BRGs, CIGs, and Councils provide a unique strategic perspective of shared experience, background, and allyship, while promoting diversity in our workplace and community. 
Our DE&I principles are also reflected in our associate training programs, which address our policies against harassment, bullying, and bias in the workplace. In 2021, a Racism Matters webinar series was utilized to address systemic racism and to ensure we continue to create an inclusive culture for all associates. Recognizing and respecting our customer base, we strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce. In the U.S., nearly 80% of our associates are female and over 50% of the associate population is comprised of people of color. Additionally, as of the end of 2021, women make up 40% of the Company's Board of Directors and 49% of the executives in the vice president and above population.
Mr. Rawlins, Designer Brands' Chief Executive Officer, is a proud signatory of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This demonstrates our goals of cultivating open dialogue, expanding diversity training, sharing best practices with other companies, and engaging our Board of Directors in the evaluation of our progress. For the third consecutive year, Designer Brands has been recognized for its LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts with a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's ("HRC") Corporate Equality Index, which places us on HRC's "Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality" list. Designer Brands has also been recognized by Forbes as one of "The Best Employers for Women" and "The Best Employers for Diversity."
We believe that paying our people fairly, regardless of gender, race, or any other status, enables us to deliver on our goal of creating an inclusive environment where we can all be ourselves, contribute ideas and do our best work. To this end, we have invested in pay equity processes that allow us to assess whether associates with similar roles and experience earn equal pay for 
comparable work. Against the backdrop of our belief that equality and diversity makes our organization stronger, we continue to focus on and invest in pay equity processes. 
We are on a journey to promote greater levels of DE&I in everything we do and recognize that there is still a long way to go. We will continue to challenge our own biases, initiate difficult conversations in meaningful ways, engage diverse perspectives to drive innovation, and intentionally evolve our operating strategies to advance this important work.
ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT
We provide all associates with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on their employment experience through engagement surveys performed on a regular basis across all business segments. Results of the surveys are measured and analyzed with a goal of enhancing the associate experience, strengthening engagement and retention, and driving change. In addition to Company-led surveys, leaders are encouraged to conduct "skip level" touch bases, host round table chats, and conduct follow-up activities to better understand associate feedback. We are embracing a flexible work environment by rolling out the option for our corporate associates to work where they choose to, whether that be in the office, at home or elsewhere, to best meet their individual needs. Upon exiting the Company, associates who voluntarily leave the business are provided an exit survey to help us measure satisfaction and engagement and identify the factors that may have contributed to pursuing another opportunity. We continue to develop opportunities for associate connection and engagement in the evolving workplace environment by listening to our associates and taking actions on what is most important and impactful to them. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Our business activities are global and subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations, and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or from which are imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs, or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and competitive position. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We have registered a number of trademarks, service marks, and domain names in the U.S., Canada, and internationally, including DSW®, DSW Shoe Warehouse®, and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse®. We also have a 40% interest in ABG-Camuto, which holds the intellectual property rights of Vince Camuto®, Louise et Cie®, and others. ABG-Camuto licenses the rights to certain of its trademarks in specific categories, such as footwear and handbags, to Camuto Group, which as of January 29, 2022, have seven years remaining on the initial license term, which are indefinitely renewable on five-year terms. We believe our trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to building our name recognition. 
SEASONALITY
Our business consists of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters, and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Generally, net sales in the fall season have been slightly higher than the spring season. Our seasonal results of operations may fluctuate based on the change in weather conditions and our customers' interest in new seasonal styles. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we have not experienced the typical seasonal trends given changes in customer behavior.
