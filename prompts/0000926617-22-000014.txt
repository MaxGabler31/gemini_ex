ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview

Corporate Vision: Our core mission is to transform the state of women’s health, globally, starting with ovarian cancer. We aim to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and to ensure that our solutions will meet the needs of women of all ages, races, ethnicities and stages of the disease. Our core patient goal is to develop a lifelong relationship with each patient, ensuring each woman has access to best-in-class diagnostics. 

Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of gynecological diseases. We plan to continue commercializing our new generation of technology as well as distribute our technology through our decentralized technology transfer service platform, known as “Aspira Synergy.” We also intend to raise public awareness regarding the diagnostic superiority of OVA1 as compared to cancer antigen 125 (“CA125”) for all women, but especially for Black women with adnexal masses, as well as the importance of machine learning algorithm development in ethnic populations. We also plan to advocate for legislation and professional society guidelines to provide broad access to our products and services. 

Mission Statement: Aspira is transforming women’s health with the discovery, development, and utilization of innovative testing options and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians assess risk, optimize patient management and improve gynecologic health outcomes for women. OVA1, which received de novo classification from the FDA, and OVERA, which is FDA-cleared, detect the risk of ovarian malignancy in women with adnexal masses via a non-invasive venipuncture. Our recently launched Aspira GenetiXSM testing offers both targeted and comprehensive genetic testing options with a gynecologic focus. With over 10 years of experience in ovarian cancer risk assessment, Aspira has expertise in cutting-edge research to inform our next generation of products. Our focus is on delivering products that allow healthcare providers to stratify risk, facilitate early detection and optimize treatment plans. 

Scientific Bases for Our Products:
Science of Biomarkers: Our focus on translational biomarkers and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule (e.g., DNA, RNA or protein) that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations, or is present in an altered form, in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e., most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e., each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 

Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tests that provide information about the disease state with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are sometimes referred to as Multivariate Index Assays (“MIAs”) and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, MIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Aspira and its collaborators are considered experts in these areas and, in the case of OVA1 and OVERA, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed in order to gain pre-market authorization from the FDA. In the case of OVA1, the FDA granted a de novo request for classification of an ovarian adnexal mass assessment score test system, a type of in vitro diagnostic device; in the case of OVERA (previously OVA1 Next Generation), FDA granted a 510(k) clearance.

Science of Genomic Targets: Our focus on genomic targets allows us to develop diagnostic tests that detect genetic drivers at early stages, with the goal of improving survival rates. In clinical genetic testing, our approach is to target specific genomic indicators of disease that are well-established in scientific journals and publications. In this approach, offered by our Aspira GenetiX testing platform, we utilize germline testing to identify well-established and highly prevalent genes associated with gynecological cancers that can help in understanding a women’s life-time risk in developing gynecological cancer. 

Science of Proteo “omics”: We are embracing the era of precision medicine, which in the case of disease detection and prevention means accounting for each individual’s variability in genes, environment and lifestyle in order to refine disease detection. Proteo “omics” integrates protegenomic data from blood measurements of proteins with genomic and transcriptomic data, to understand the molecular drivers of the cancer, as measuring the three in combination strengthens the ability to diagnose cancer early in the blood. We plan to build a proteomic approach, which will combine our already established protein biomarkers 

 
of ovarian cancer (i.e. OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus) with genomic targets that characterize the drivers of mutation of ovarian cancer. This proteogenomic approach should enable us to develop and validate a novel prognostic and diagnostic test for ovarian cancer, thereby allowing for specific targeted therapies.  We expect this will be our foundational model for all new test development moving forward. 

Our Business and Products: We currently market and sell the following products and related services: (1) OVA1, a blood test intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery is planned when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy; (2) OVERA, a second-generation biomarker reflex intended to maintain OVA1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity; (3) OVA1plus, a reflex offering which uses OVA1 as the primary test and OVERA as a confirmation for OVA1 intermediate range results and leverages the strengths of OVA1’s MIA sensitivity and OVERA’s (MIA2G) specificity and as a result reduces false elevations by over 40%; (4) Aspira GenetiX, a genetic test for hereditary gynecologic cancer risk, with a core focus on hereditary female reproductive cancers, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, uterine and cervical cancers; and (5) Aspira Synergy, our decentralized testing platform and cloud service for decentralized global access of both protein biomarker and hereditary genetic testing. We plan to make OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus and Aspira GenetiX and future technology available through Aspira Synergy. Our OVA1 test received FDA de novo classification in September 2009. OVA1 comprises instruments, assays, reagents, and the OVACALC software, which includes a proprietary algorithm that produces a risk score. Our OVERA test, which includes an updated version of OVACALC, received FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2016. OVA1 and OVERA each use the Roche cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms for analysis of proteins. Through December 31, 2021, our product and related services revenue has been limited to revenue generated by sales of OVA1, OVA1plus and Aspira GenetiX. In 2021, we entered into decentralized arrangements with large healthcare networks and large practices for our Aspira Synergy platform offering specialty and genetic testing solutions.  The modules available under Aspira Synergy include our flagship OVA1plus risk assessment, Genetics Carrier Screening, and Genetics Hereditary Cancer solutions. The Company has entered into four technology transfer agreements since the launch of Aspira Synergy. The first two agreements are with two of the nation’s largest and leading independent women’s healthcare groups which together include approximately 750 providers and serve approximately 950,000 patients annually.  The other two agreements are with independent laboratories providing services across five states. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we started receiving specimens related to our OVA1 Aspira Synergy product. 

We are developing three additional products and related services, including two diagnostic algorithms, OVAWatch and EndoCheck, as well as a high-risk diagnostic algorithm, OVAInherit, for patients with or without a pelvic mass who are genetically predisposed to ovarian cancer. These products may be launched as LDTs or FDA-cleared tests.
OVAWatch has been developed and is validated for use in Aspira’s CLIA-certified high complexity lab as a non-invasive risk assessment test for use in conjunction with clinical assessment and imaging to determine ovarian cancer risk for patients with an adnexal mass. OVAWatch is currently under market and scientific review. We plan to launch the OVAWatch test as an LDT in two stages. Phase I will be a single use point in time test, and Phase II will allow for serial monitoring. We will focus on advancing to the commercial phase of the OVAWatch launch plan including driving provider adoption during the second half of 2022. We believe the single-use product has the potential to triple the addressable market over OVA1plus our current ovarian cancer test. The launch of the serial monitoring test remains targeted for 2023 upon publication of data from the ongoing prospective serial monitoring clinical study. 
EndoCheck, a non-invasive blood test to be used in conjunction with other non-surgical modalities, is designed to be an aid in the detection of endometriosis and address the patient population of women who are experiencing moderate to severe pelvic pain to provide non-invasive surgical confirmation that their symptoms are indicative of endometriosis. The goal of this test is to support an early diagnosis and direct appropriate medical management that potentially reduces the progression of disease. Current detection methods for endometriosis require surgery and a surgical biopsy diagnosis and/or visualization diagnosis. EndoCheck is intended to address this large patient population by using a non-invasive solution with both the sensitivity and specificity equal to or greater than surgical biopsy and/or visualization.
OVAInherit will be designed as a non-invasive high-risk diagnostic tool, intended for those patients with or without a pelvic mass who are genetically predisposed to gynecologic cancer. It will use genetics, proteins and other modalities to assess the likelihood that a woman has an early-stage gynecological cancer that is not visible using traditional ultrasound methodologies, and thereby to aid in early diagnoses. Our OVAInherit related clinical studies, OVANex and OVA360, initiated in late 2019 and early 2020, respectively, are focused on developing data to support a diagnostic test for the early detection of ovarian cancer.
We ultimately plan to commercialize each of OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX, OVAWatch, EndoCheck, OVAInherit and Aspira Synergy on a global level. We currently hold CE marks for OVA1 and OVERA. In addition, each of OVA1 and OVERA, and the reflex offering, OVA1plus, will be offered on our global testing platform, which will allow both tests to be deployed worldwide.

 


Outside of the United States, we have studies in process to validate OVERA and OVA1 in specific populations. This includes active international distribution agreements for OVERA with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. The MacroHealth, Inc. agreement was our first agreement regarding our decentralized technology, Aspira Synergy, for OVERA specimen testing.

We own and operate Aspira Labs, Inc. (“ASPiRA LABS”), based in Austin, Texas, a Clinical Chemistry and Endocrinology Laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based risk assessment to aid in clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 and OVERA tests, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS. ASPiRA LABS holds a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a supplier number to ASPiRA LABS in 2015. 

Core Products

About OVA1 and OVERA: Our initial product, OVA1, is a blood test that is intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery is planned when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. The FDA issued a de novo authorization for OVA1 in September 2009, and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. In March 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for a second-generation biomarker panel known as OVA1 Next Generation, which we call OVERA and which is intended to maintain OVA1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity.

About OVA1plus: In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched OVA1plus. OVA1plus is a reflex test performed for those OVA1 test results that are in the intermediate risk range. For all OVA1 test results in this intermediate risk range, OVERA is performed to stratify a patient’s risk of malignancy. This is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy by increasing specificity which reduces false positive rate by 40%. OVA1plus also helps drive earlier detection, which in turn may lower overall healthcare costs and reduce inefficiencies in the care pathway. OVA1plus is also available through our decentralized platform structure, Aspira Synergy. This allows other facilities, including hospital networks and large physician practices, to perform OVA1plus tests using Aspira Synergy’s cloud-based information and storage platform to receive the OVA1plus score, enabling point of care testing, increased reach and worldwide access to our OVA1plus technology.

About Aspira GenetiX: In June 2019, we launched Aspira GenetiX, which is a genetic test for gynecologic cancer risk, with a core focus on female reproductive cancers, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, uterine and cervical cancers. Aspira GenetiX’s initial offering is designed to detect hereditary breast and gynecological cancer syndromes and test for genetic carriers of autosomal recessive and X-linked diseases. Women who test positive for variants of such highly-prevalent genes associated with hereditary risk have an elevated life-time risk of developing cancers. Aspira GenetiX complements OVA1plus and is sold at the same call point. Using Aspira GenetiX in combination with OVA1plus offers physicians a comprehensive personalized risk assessment for ovarian cancer. As of January 2021, our Aspira GenetiX report included enriched literature data and approved National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical management guidelines for those women who present with a positive genetic finding. This allows immediate clinical management access to the clinician so they may counsel their patient in a timely manner.

About Aspira Synergy: In March 2021, we launched the validated new decentralized platform and cloud service technology, now branded as Aspira Synergy. Aspira Synergy is an en-suite, cloud-based technology transfer solution that provides an end-to-end solution from specimen collection to a customized white-label report for clinical laboratories to internalize testing of our products. The Aspira Synergy platform offers specialty and genetic testing solutions to empower health systems, physician groups and independent laboratories to conduct tests and receive results by using the Aspira Synergy platform.  The Aspira Synergy platform offers three modules: the OVA1plus risk assessment module which includes two FDA-cleared tests (OVA1 and OVERA), the Genetics Carrier Screening module and the Genetics Hereditary Cancer module. 

The Aspira Synergy OVA1plus solution launched in 2021 with our first fully deployed and implemented solution was with one of the largest women’s health networks in the USA. The Aspira Synergy OVA1plus solution gives this women’s health network and other clients the ability to perform OVA1plus tests using the Aspira Synergy platform to receive the OVA1plus risk assessment score, enabling increased reach and patient access. The deployment process of the Aspira Synergy Genetics client projects began in the first quarter of 2022. 



The Aspira Synergy Genetics solution includes a fully validated Next Generation Sequencing (“NGS”) assay. The Aspira Synergy Genetics solution is comprised of a custom-built technology which leverages a novel artificial intelligence-based bioinformatics pipeline that has been customized specifically for the proprietary Aspira genetics chemistry, resulting in reduced workflows and redundancies typically associated with internalizing genetics. Aspira Synergy Genetics can be fully automated, providing limited wet lab and specimen analysis time, allowing clients to implement and run genetic testing at scale and with minimal cost, time and labor at accelerated turn-around times. In July 2021, Aspira was granted a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation for our laboratory at our Connecticut office, which has enabled us to support our Aspira Synergy platform. We expect the Aspira Synergy platform to expand our breadth and reach of access for all Aspira products, as we expect that every commercialized product, as well as pipeline innovations, will eventually be integrated into our Aspira Synergy platform. 

Product Pipeline

About OVAWatch: The OVAWatch blood test is designed to support detecting the risk of malignancy in women with an adnexal mass by using the test to first confirm a benign mass and potentially monitor the mass, in conjunction with ultrasounds, and then to confirm a risk of malignancy and lastly to help assess clinical management next steps. The test was developed through a rigorous scientific and clinical-based process based on data from the New York State laboratory developed test and from our FDA regulatory process in 3,000 patients. The OVAWatch technology will be validated for this application in three separate cohorts of women. The first cohort will be patients with an identified pelvic mass and symptoms. The second cohort will be women whose pelvic mass is found incidentally and are asymptomatic, and that are also not scheduled for surgery. The third cohort will be women with or without a pelvic mass that are genetically predisposed to develop ovarian cancer. Validation in this overall patient population will be supported by our longitudinal prospective clinical study launched in 2020. We will be launching the OVAWatch test as an LDT in two stages. Phase I will be a single use point in time test, and Phase II will allow for serial monitoring. We will focus on advancing to the commercial phase of the OVAWatch launch plan including driving provider adoption during the second half of 2022. We believe the single-use product has the potential to triple the addressable market over OVA1plus our current ovarian cancer test. The launch of the serial monitoring test remains targeted for 2023 upon publication of data from the ongoing prospective serial monitoring clinical study. The OVAWatch test is expected to have a high sensitivity and specificity as well as a high negative predictive value, which will allow physicians to serially monitor women with a mass to delay or avoid unnecessary surgery. A manuscript describing the initial analytical validation results was submitted to a peer-reviewed publication and was accepted on March 22, 2022. 

About EndoCheck: The EndoCheck blood test is designed to be an aid in the diagnosis and detection of endometriosis. In the first quarter of 2021, we submitted to the FDA a Breakthrough Device designation request with respect to EndoCheck. The FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program provides patients and health care providers with timely access to medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic tests, which provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions by speeding up their development, assessment and review. We had significant and productive dialogue with the FDA regarding our request, and the FDA has demonstrated interest in continuing to work with us on EndoCheck. Given the FDA’s feedback, we anticipate continuing our discussions with the agency on Breakthrough Device Program designation as we develop the required performance data. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant our request for EndoCheck to be designated as a Breakthrough Device. If our device is granted a Breakthrough Device designation, we plan to move forward with FDA interaction through a variety of options including sprint discussions, a request for a discussion on a data development plan, and a request for clinical protocol agreement and confirmation that any final submission would be a de novo submission. In late October 2021, the FDA published updated guidance for the content of Premarket Submission for Software Contained in Medical Devices, specific to “Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learnings-Based Software as a Medical Device” which clarified the FDA’s expectations and provided the framework for our future EndoCheck device. We are currently working to ensure our EndoCheck development process is aligned with the FDA’s proposed framework. We plan to proceed on a parallel path with the Breakthrough Device process as well as with the LDT development process. This dual track approach pursues the commercialization of an EndoCheck LDT, whereby both clinical validity and real-world clinical utility data may be developed to support successful clinical adoption and reimbursement of the LDT while providing the data needed to demonstrate device performance for both a Breakthrough Designation decision and the subsequent FDA authorization required to market a device designated as “Breakthrough﻿.” 

About OVAInherit: The OVAInherit blood test is designed to target a high-risk diagnostic test for those patients who are genetically predisposed or have family history of ovarian cancer. Studies have shown that in the general U.S. population 1 in 400 women have a high risk BRCA1/2 gene mutation. Among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, the prevalence is even greater and 1 in 40 have a high risk BRCA1/2 gene mutation. This multi-modal solution will include genetics, proteins and other modalities to deliver a personalized risk assessment of ovarian cancer. We plan to pursue FDA 510(k) clearance and a CE Mark for this product. In the second half of 2020 we began two clinical trials, OVANex and OVA360, to evaluate our OVAInherit product. There is no definite timeline for the OVAInherit launch at this time.


Pipeline Expansion Strategy: We are focused on execution of the following ten core strategic business drivers in delivering state-of-the-art gynecologic health solutions starting with ovarian cancer diagnostics, and specialized laboratory services to build long-term value for our investors: 
1)Maximizing the existing OVA1plus (OVA1 and OVERA, a next generation biomarker reflex, on the same platform) opportunity by actively pursuing payer coverage and government support to drive commercialization of OVA1plus, which we believe will deliver improved domestic market penetration and international expansion;
2)Leveraging our existing database and specimen bank while building our specimen and data repository of gynecologic pelvic mass patients;
3)Expanding our product offerings to additional women’s health diseases with a focus on pelvic disease conditions such as pelvic mass monitoring and endometriosis by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, genetics, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass; this may occur via licensing or other business development and merger and acquisition opportunities that represent synergistic offerings in women’s health;
4)Coupling our OVA1 products with an individual’s hereditary genetic risk to refine ovarian cancer risk assessment for high-risk populations; and
5)Establishing a proprietary decentralization platform, Aspira Synergy, to allow large healthcare networks and gynecologic practices to access OVA1plus technology algorithms and Aspira GenetiX algorithms as a technology transfer service, while also obtaining access to de-identified data through these arrangements to allow us to enhance our algorithm development on a cost-effective basis.

We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women facing gynecologic disease and conditions and the continued development of our business.

Studies and Publications

In parallel to building our OVA platform offering and our commercial deployment, we have been working on several key publications and product extensions. 

On August 10, 2021, in a special ovarian cancer edition, Diagnostics published a paper entitled “Salvaging Detection of Early-Stage Ovarian Malignancies When CA125 is Not Informative.” The paper reports that in a retrospective study of 2,305 patients, OVA1 detected over 50% of ovarian malignancies in premenopausal women that CA125 would have missed. OVA1 also correctly identified 63% of early-stage cancers missed by CA125. This paper further validates and supports OVA1’s superior early-stage detection of ovarian cancer versus the current standard of care in a large population.
The Diagnostic Field

The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. In 2021, Fortune Business Insight, a market research and business consulting partnership, published a study which forecasts the global in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) market to reach $149.03 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3% from 2021 to 2028. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women’s health where we have established strong key opinion leaders, and provider and patient relationships. Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers, will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate. In addition, the areas of oncology and women’s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. Furthermore, an increasing number of women are becoming aware of the importance of early detection, particularly in gynecologic diseases.

Ovarian Cancer

Background

Commonly known as the “silent killer,” ovarian cancer leads to nearly 13,000 deaths each year in the United States. As of early 2022, The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimated that nearly 20,000 new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the National Cancer Institute, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage (stage 1), patients have up to a 93%, 5-year survival rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy. However, many ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed after the tumor has spread outside the ovary. For ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 30.0%. 

While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of long-term survival from the disease, another factor that predicts clinical outcomes from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists coupled with specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (“SGO”) and the ACOG recommends referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Unfortunately, we believe only about one-third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists, in part because of inadequate diagnostics that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high-risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low-risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Invasive masses have a disease outside the pelvic mass and need to go to chemotherapy treatment immediately followed by surgical removal. The goal is to catch the mass early before it becomes late-stage cancer.

Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of simple ovarian cysts in women 55 years of age and older can be as high as 14%.[1] Adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group. For instance, in the University of Kentucky ovarian cancer screening project, the rate of postmenopausal women with persistently abnormal ultrasound findings requiring surgery was 1.4%.[2] According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 36.8 million women between the ages of 50 and 70 in the U.S., suggesting that there are more than 500,000 suspicious adnexal masses in this segment alone. Those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of OVA1 or OVERA.

The ACOG Ovarian Cancer Guidelines and the SGO guidelines help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA for the monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer only, is negative in up to 50% of early-stage ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer, including menstruation, benign ovarian masses, liver disease, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy and uterine fibroids. 

These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test’s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses. Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value. However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the “Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines”) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer overall.

In November 2016, ACOG practice bulletin 174 (November 2016) states the following regarding our OVA1-branded product “The multivariate index assay has demonstrated higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for ovarian malignancy when compared with clinical impression and CA 125 alone.”[3]

The ovarian cancer information page on American Cancer Society’s website (cancer.org/cancer/ovarian-cancer/about/new-research.html) indicates that:



For women who have an ovarian tumor, a test called OVA1 can measure the levels of 5 proteins in the blood. The levels of these proteins, when looked at together, are used to determine whether a woman’s tumor should be considered low-risk or high-risk. If the tumor is labeled ‘low-risk’ based on this test, the woman is not likely to have cancer. If the tumor is considered ‘high-risk,’ the woman is more likely to have a cancer, and should see a specialist (a gynecologic oncologist). This test is NOT a screening test and it is NOT a test to decide if you should have surgery or not− it is meant for women who have an ovarian tumor where surgery has been decided but have not yet been referred to a gynecologic oncologist.[4]

In 2019, two studies were released indicating superior clinical performance of OVA1 over CA125 and OVA1 over CA125, HE4 and Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”) in African American women. [5],[6]

Commercialization and Distribution

Starting in 2014, we offered OVA1 via ASPiRA LABS. In March 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Aspira’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS. Pursuant to this agreement as subsequently amended, Quest Diagnostics has continued to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to ASPiRA LABS for testing in exchange for a market value fee. Per the terms of the agreement, we may not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers any tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. 

We have active international distribution agreements for OVERA with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines.

Customers

In the United States, our clinical customer base can be segmented into four major groups: physicians (including women’s care super-groups), physician office laboratories and national and regional laboratories. Both within and outside the United States, specimens are sent directly to us, and we bill either through payer contracts, client bill arrangements or a software subscription service via our decentralized technology transfer relationships established between us and authorized distributors. 
Research and Development

Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and the combinations of biomarkers with other “omics” that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We have done this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the Harvard Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as well as through genetic testing providers such as Baylor Genetics. In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics and other organizations, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases. 

Our research and development efforts are detailed in the "Product Pipeline” section above.

In 2019, two studies identified a disparity in diagnosis for African American women and demonstrated that OVA1 has superior sensitivity for detection in this population over CA125 or ROMA.

‎


Commercial Operations

We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of OVA1. In February 2015, Aspira received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world’s leading certification bodies. We currently hold CE marks for OVA1 and OVERA. We are targeting markets outside of the United States now that we have OVERA cleared on the Roche cobas platform, which is available globally. 

Approximately 17,359 OVA1 tests were performed in 2021 compared to 13,557 in 2020. The increase is a result of expanded commercial efforts. In 2021, we continued to increase sales through Regional Account Managers and Directors. As awareness of our product continues to build, these representatives are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive payer coverage decisions. They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology solutions package and increasing patient experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus. 

There are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones ahead. First, the average gynecologist only sees about 2 to 4 patients per month who may need our OVA1plus test, and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern. Second, despite gains in positive medical policy coverage and contract agreements, insurance coverage and patient bills remain a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a provider who is supportive of our products. We have instituted a “Patient Transparency Program” to assist with this process by proactively assessing insurance and educating patients on testing costs prior to testing being performed.

Revenue and Reimbursement

In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for OVA1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to OVA1 tests being performed at ASPiRA LABS in Texas, this local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. ASPiRA LABS also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for OVA1. Through December 31, 2021, Aspira’s product and related services revenue has primarily been limited to revenue generated by sales of OVA1, with Aspira GenetiX generating minimal revenue throughout 2020 and 2021.

In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (“MAAA”) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable. In late 2016, OVA1 was included on the list of clinical diagnostic laboratory test procedure codes as one for which the CMS would require reporting of private payer rates as part of the implementation of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”). In November 2017, we announced that the CMS released the Final 2018 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (“CLFS”), effective January 1, 2018. Under the new fee schedule, the price for OVA1(MIA) (code 81503) is $897. This is a four-fold increase over the previous CMS rate, and this new rate was based on the median of private payer payments submitted to CMS by companies, including ASPiRA LABS, as part of the market-based payment reform mandated through PAMA. The rate was scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020. This rate is now extended through 2023. There are no assurances that reimbursement rates will not be changed after 2023. 

CMS also published a final price for OVERA of $950, which was benchmarked to the only proteomic test currently on the CLFS that uses biomarkers and an algorithm to produce a prognostic score. The rate is scheduled to be in effect through 2022. 

In 2021, we announced 8 new contractual arrangements which brought the total number of covered lives to approximately 194 million as of December 31, 2021, representing 59% of the lives in the U.S.

We are reimbursed for Aspira GenetiX based on either contracted rates or out-of-network rates for covered testing under patient insurance plans.



Competition 

The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 

develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators; 
develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators; 
obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or 
obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers’ ability to use our or our collaborators’ diagnostic products. 

We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.

Fujirebio Diagnostics sells ROMA. ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. This test has the same intended use and precautions as OVA1. ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of studies done in 2013 and 2019, we believe that OVA1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test.

In addition, competitors such as Abbott Laboratories, Angle, Anixa, AOA, Becton Dickinson, Exact Sciences (Thrive), Grail and InterVenn have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 

We also compete in the development and commercialization of genetic testing for hereditary cancer with companies in the United States and internationally. The testing services offered by competitive clinical laboratories, if performed in-house, may be easier to develop and market than our testing, which is performed by a third party.

Several companies such as Ambry Genetics, Invitae Corporation, Laboratory Corporation of America, Inc., Myriad Genetics, Inc. and Natera offer similar genetic testing for hereditary cancer genetic testing. We believe that the technology offered by our testing is competitive with these companies and that our existing relationships with gynecologist offices enhance our ability to reach customers.

Intellectual Property Protection 

Our intellectual property includes federally registered trademarks and service marks as well as federally pending trademark and service mark applications for our product and service offerings and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 20 issued United States patents, 9 pending United States patent applications and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications are directed to diagnostic technologies.
Manufacturing

We are the manufacturer of OVA1 and OVERA. The component assays of OVA1 and OVERA use purchased reagents. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays. As part of our quality systems, reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in OVA1 and OVERA. Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in OVA1 and OVERA. OVA1plus is a service offering that combines OVA1 and OVERA. Our principal supplier is Roche Diagnostics Corporation.

Environmental Matters

Medical Waste

We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. ASPiRA LABS is operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
Occupational Safety

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
Specimen Transportation

Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
Government Regulation 

FDA Regulation of Medical Devices

In the U.S., medical devices, including IVD products, or IVDs, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices, including IVDs. IVDs are a type of medical device and include reagents and instruments used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases or conditions, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic, and screening tests can also be IVDs. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative and judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval applications (“PMAs”), issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject only to the general regulatory controls. Class II devices are moderate risk. They are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices. They are required to obtain premarket approval and comply with post-market conditions of approval in addition to general regulatory controls. 
Generally, establishments that design and/or manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA. They also must provide the FDA with a list of the devices that they design and/or manufacture at their facilities.
The FDA enforces its requirements by market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing 

 
instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are sufficiently severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include:
cease and desist orders;
injunctions or consent decrees;
civil monetary penalties;
recall, detention or seizure of products;
operating restrictions or partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
refusal of or delay in granting requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;
withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or premarket approvals that are already granted;
refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for devices; and
criminal prosecution.
Pre-Market Authorization and Notification
While most Class I and some Class II devices may be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most other medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a PMA application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo classification process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. PMA applications, 510(k) premarket notifications, and de novo requests require payment of substantial user fees that are increased each fiscal year.
510(k) Premarket Notification
Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and a limited number of Class I devices typically follows the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the “predicate device.” A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications, or a product previously placed in Class II or Class I through the de novo classification process. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
FDA has a user fee goal to apply no more than 90 calendar review days to 510(k) submissions. During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 270 days. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
De Novo Classification
Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of novel low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted a provision that allows the FDA to classify a novel low- to moderate-risk device into Class I or II in the absence of a predicate device that would support 510(k) clearance. The FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of devices submitted for review under the de novo pathway, and devices determined to be Class II through this pathway can serve as predicate devices for future 510(k) applicants. The de novo pathway can require clinical data. 
FDA has a user fee goal to review a de novo request in 150 calendar review days. During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be as long as 330 days.
PMA Approval
A Class III product not eligible for either 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway.

 

Results from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all non-clinical, clinical, and other testing and information relating to the product’s marketing history, design, labeling, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
The PMA approval process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification process and de novo classification process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA has a user fee goal to review a PMA in 180 calendar review days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 320 review days if the submission does require advisory committee input. During the process, FDA may issue a major deficiency letter, which stops the review clock. The applicant has up to 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 360 days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 500 days if the submission does require advisory committee input. 
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
Clinical Trials
Generally, at least one clinical trial is required to support a PMA application. Clinical studies also may be required for de novo classification or a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials may also be conducted or continued to satisfy post-approval requirements for devices with PMAs. For significant risk investigational devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved under an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk investigational device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites and are designed to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device when considering whether a device satisfies the statutory standard for commercialized. Clinical trials, for both significant and nonsignificant risk devices, must be approved by an institutional review board (“IRB”), an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable 

 
risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial it has approved to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions or sanctions.
Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. 
Post-Market Requirements
After a device is placed on the market, numerous general regulatory controls apply. These include: the QSR (which requires manufacturers to have a quality policy and procedures to ensure that devices are manufactured and records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, compliant handling, and record keeping), labeling regulations, the medical device reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and reports of corrections and removals regulations (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act). Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject a manufacturer to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties.
Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDC Act, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA’s oversight of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context.  
Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for “off-label” uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.  
Violations of the FDC Act relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.
For a PMA or Class II 510(k) or de novo device, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to the QSR after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with the QSR. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
Clinical laboratories operating in or testing specimens from the U.S. are subject to CLIA, and related federal and state regulations, which provide for regulation of laboratory testing. Any customers using IVDs for clinical use in the United States will be regulated under CLIA, which establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. In particular, these regulations mandate that clinical laboratories must be certified by the federal government or a federally approved accreditation agency, or must be located in a state that has been deemed exempt from CLIA requirements because the state has in effect laws that provide for requirements equal to or more stringent than CLIA requirements. Moreover, these laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards, and they must undergo proficiency testing and inspections. The CLIA standards applicable to clinical laboratories are 

 
based on the complexity of the method of testing performed by the laboratory, as deemed by FDA, which range from “waived” to “moderate complexity” to “high complexity.”
Laboratory-Developed Tests
The FDA considers LDTs to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA considers an LDT to be a test that is designed, developed, validated, and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has historically taken the position that it has the authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices under the FDC Act, but it has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to LDTs. This means that even though the FDA believes it can impose regulatory requirements on LDTs, such as requirements to obtain premarket approval or clearance of LDTs, it has generally chosen not to enforce those requirements as of the date of this Form 10-K. Although FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion for LDTs, the FDA retains discretion to require compliance with premarket or post-market requirements, such as when FDA deems it appropriate to address significant public health concerns. 
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA began requiring clinical laboratories offering LDTs for SARS-CoV-2 to obtain emergency use authorization (“EUA”) before offering testing. In August 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced that FDA would no longer require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking. In November 2021, HHS announced that this policy had been withdrawn, after which FDA resumed requiring submission of EUA requests for COVID-19 LDTs. FDA has not indicated an intent to regulate other, non-COVID, LDTs, which suggests that FDA’s general policy of enforcement discretion remains in place. 
Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been previously introduced. In March 2020, the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (“VALID”), Act of 2020 was introduced in the Senate, which proposes a regulatory framework for IVDs and LDTs and would require premarket approval for some in vitro clinical tests. The VALID Act was reintroduced in July 2021. In March 2020, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories (“VITAL”) Act of 2020 was introduced in the Senate, which would expressly shift the regulation of LDTs from FDA to CMS. The VITAL Act was reintroduced in May 2021. Neither statute has been enacted. 

As a manufacturer of IVDs, we are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the FDC Act and regulations thereunder. We are required to register and list our products with the FDA and to comply with the QSR. We are required to submit a medical device report whenever we receive information that reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have had zero complaints that required us to submit a medical device report to FDA. Additionally, we are subject to inspection by the FDA. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion. 

Clinical studies of our IVD products, such as OVANex and OVA360, must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. 

Our IVD devices also may require premarket authorization by FDA. OVA1, the first FDA-authorized blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses, was authorized by the FDA in September 2009 under the de novo classification pathway. We received 510(k) clearance for OVERA, our second-generation biomarker panel, in March 2016. 

We also may be required to conduct post-market surveillance of medical devices as a condition of granting marketing authorization. With respect to OVA1, the FDA required us to perform post-market surveillance to gather additional data regarding test performance. This study has been completed.

Our clinical laboratory activities are subject to CLIA and related state laws. In June 2014, we launched a clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. ASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license or permit in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In July 2021, we were granted a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation for our laboratory at our Connecticut office. We are subject to periodic surveys and inspections to maintain our CLIA certification, and such certification is also required to obtain payment from Medicare, Medicaid and certain other third-party payers.

Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products.

We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996. Each country also 

 
maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In February 2015, Aspira also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world’s leading certification bodies. In March 2015, OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market OVERA in the European Union.
