Plan of Operations 
 
As at July 31, 2018, we had a cash balance of $69,616, compared to a cash balance of $337,099 as of July 31, 2017.
 
Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is to continue our current diamond drilling exploration activities at the I-M Mine Property. We plan to continue the recommended work program as outlined in the Report on the I-M Mine Property, which was issued on June 1, 2017.
 
The I-M Mine Property hosts numerous exploration targets that warrant drilling. While a significant drill program is required to test these targets, our initial plans are to complete the limited exploratory work program described in the Report. Contingent upon available financing, we plan to drill additional targets.

The Report recommended a single 6,000 ft (1,830 m) surface diamond drill hole to provide geological samples from most of the major lithological units on the I-M Mine Property geology. The single hole has been designed to pierce the #1 Vein projection approximately 400 ft (122 m) below the elevation of the I2400 Level and then carry on through the potential western extensions of the Idaho 3 Vein System. The objectives of this drill hole were as follows:
 

1) | Provide a long drill intercept of the Brunswick Block from surface to the Serpentinite contact
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Test the up-dip area and below the 52 Vein (60 Winze) mineralized area in the Brunswick Block 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Test the #1 Vein below the I2400 Level 
---+-------------------------------------------


4) | Test the serpentinite footwall for potential 3 Vein/Rose Garden analogies 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Test and obtain samples of ankerite alteration in the serpentinite unit 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


6) | Test for the location of the major Idaho faults 
---+----------------------------------------------------


7) | Drill through the serpentinite unit to provide further insight on the thickness and geometry of this unit at depth 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8) | Determine drill hole deviation, drilling productivity, and drilling costs to allow refinement of the design of a major drill program at the I-M Mine Property 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, Amec Foster Wheeler has recommended that the digital geological model created by the Rise management team be expanded to include model channel samples, the lithological contacts and structures such as the diabase dikes, ankerite alteration envelopes, minor quartz veins, and all faults mapped by the historic mine operators. This work may provide additional insight into the mineralization controls at the I-M Mine Property.
 
The cost of the work program was estimated in the Report to be approximately $595,000 as shown in the following table:

On January 3, 2018, we announced the assay results from drill hole B-17-01, the first drill hole of the exploration drilling program at the I-M Gold Project. Diamond drill hole B-17-01 (the Drillhole) was completed in November 2017. The Drillhole had a total length of 1419 m (4654 ft) and reached a depth of ~1157 m (3794 ft) below surface. The starting azimuth of the Drillhole was 310 degrees and the ending azimuth was 278 degrees with an average inclination of ~55 degrees. An intercept of 62.7 gpt gold over 2.7 m was intersected in the center vein of the Brunswick #1 Vein Set, approximately 50 m below the B1600 level at a depth of ~540 m below surface. The true width of the intercept is estimated at 1.4 m. The Drillhole intersected three sub-parallel veins at the Brunswick #1 Vein. The B1 Vein Set, including the Center Vein and two sections of internal waste, averaged 12.2 gpt gold over 14.9 m with an estimated true width of 7.8 m.
 
The Drillhole azimuth deviated significantly from the planned azimuth and, therefore, did not intersect the Idaho #1 Vein at depth as contemplated in the recommended Work Program. The target described in the Report remains untested and will be tested with future drilling.
 
On April 25. 2018, we announced the recommencement of exploration core drilling at the I-M Gold Project. We plan to drill additional holes in the B1 Vein to follow-up on Drillhole B-17-01. These holes will target an area between the B1600 level and the B2300 level. Historical records report both levels on the B1 Vein to be mineralized. We will also test several other Brunswick veins which are parallel to the B1 Vein. We expect to be drilling the Brunswick targets until approximately mid-June and then we will move the drill to test the Idaho #1 Vein target as recommended in the Technical Report.
 
We have implemented a quality control program for our drill program to ensure best practices in the sampling and analysis of the drill core. This includes the insertion of blind blanks, duplicates and certified standards. HQ and NQ sized drill core is saw cut with half of the drill core sampled at intervals based on geological criteria including lithology, visual mineralization, and alteration. The remaining half of the core is stored on-site at our warehouse in Grass Valley, California. Drill core samples are transported in sealed bags to ALS Minerals analytical assay lab in Reno, Nevada.
 
All gold assays were obtained using a method of screen fire assaying. The Historic I-M Mine Project is known to contain coarse gold, for which a screen fire assay is the best way to obtain a definitive result. This procedure involves screening a large pulverized sample of up to 1 kg at 100 microns. The entire oversize (including the disposable screen) is fire assayed as this contains the coarse gold and a duplicate determination is made on the minus 100 micron fraction. A calculation can then be made to determine the total weight of gold in the sample. Any +100 micron material remaining on the screen is retained and analyzed in its entirety by fire assay with gravimetric finish and reported as the Au (+) fraction result. The –100 micron fraction is homogenized and two sub-samples of 50 grams are analyzed by fire assay with

AAS finish. If the grade of the material exceeds 10 gpt the sample is re-assayed using a gravimetric finish. The average of the two results is taken and reported as the Au (-) fraction result. All three values are used in calculating the combined gold content of the plus and minus fractions.
 
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue our proposed exploration activities. For these reasons, our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
 
Employees
 
We currently have eight full-time employees, which include our Chief Executive Officer. Our other officers and directors provide services to us on an as-needed basis, and we plan to rely on their efforts, as well as those of a number of independent consultants, to manage our operations for the foreseeable future.
Government Regulations
 
We plan to engage in mineral exploration and development activities and will accordingly be exposed to environmental risks associated with mineral exploration activity. We are the operator of the I-M Mine Property.
 
Our exploration and development activities will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and permits governing protection of the environment. Among other things, its operations must comply with the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 as administered by the United States Department of Labor.
 
Our plan is to conduct our operations in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. It believes that its operations comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material respects.
 
The costs associated with implementing and complying with environmental requirements can be substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in developing or conducting operations on its properties, including the I-M Mine Property, the extent of which cannot be predicted with any certainty.
 
To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing environmental liabilities on the I-M Mine Property.
