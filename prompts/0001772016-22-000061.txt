ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (“BellRing”) was formed in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2021 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc. (“Post”) for the purpose of effecting the separation of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (“Old BellRing”) from Post. Under a transaction agreement and plan of merger (the “Transaction Agreement”) that we entered into on October 26, 2021 and amended as of February 28, 2022, with Post, Old BellRing and our subsidiary BellRing Merger Sub Corporation (“Merger Sub”), Post distributed approximately 80.1% of its interest in us to Post’s shareholders and Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing, with Old BellRing surviving and becoming our subsidiary. On March 10, 2022, as a result of the completion of the transactions provided for under the Transaction Agreement (including the “Separation” and “Distribution”, each defined below), we became a new public holding company and the successor registrant to Old BellRing. In this report, we refer to the transactions undertaken pursuant to the Transaction Agreement as the “Spin-off.” The Spin-off is described in more detail below.
Our Company
We are a leader in the global convenient nutrition category, aiming to enhance the lives of our consumers by providing them with nutritious, great-tasting products they can enjoy throughout the day. Our primary brands, Premier Protein and Dymatize, target a broad range of consumers and compete in all major product forms, including ready-to-drink (“RTD”) protein shakes, other RTD beverages and powders. Our products are distributed across a diverse network of channels including club, food, drug and mass (“FDM”), eCommerce, specialty and convenience.
We have organically grown our net sales from $988.3 million in our year ended September 30, 2020 to $1,371.5 million in our year ended September 30, 2022. Over the same period, net earnings including redeemable noncontrolling interest increased from $100.1 million in our year ended September 30, 2020 to $116.0 million in our year ended September 30, 2022.
The Spin-off
Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and in connection with a series of corporate separation transactions, on March 9, 2022, Post contributed to us (i) all of its nonvoting common units of BellRing Brands, LLC (“BellRing LLC”) and its sole outstanding share of Old BellRing’s Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Old BellRing Class B Common Stock” and with Old BellRing’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Old BellRing Class A Common Stock), collectively, the “Old BellRing Common Stock”)) and (ii) $550.4 million in cash, in exchange for Post’s right to receive $840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2030 and limited liability company interests in us (prior to our conversion to a Delaware corporation, as described below).
On March 10, 2022, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to “BellRing Brands, Inc.”, and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “BellRing Common Stock”) to its shareholders in a pro-rata distribution (the “Distribution”). Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the record date for the Distribution. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders. 
Also on March 10, 2022, upon completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the “Merger”), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock and $2.97 in cash, resulting in $115.5 million in total consideration paid to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger. 
As a result of the Spin-off, we became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. 
Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2% of BellRing Common Stock and the former holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock owned approximately 28.5% of BellRing Common Stock. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure of Old BellRing was eliminated. As of September 30, 2022, Post owned approximately 3.4% of BellRing Common Stock.
Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “BellRing,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “our Company” refer to (1) Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the 
Table of Contents
completion of the Spin-off, including BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (“Premier Nutrition”), Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (“Dymatize”), Supreme Protein, LLC (“Supreme Protein), the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International GmbH (“Active Nutrition International”) and (2) us and our consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off, including, BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein and Active Nutrition International, in each case, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates.
Our History prior to the Spin-off
Prior to completion of the Spin-off, and subsequent to Old BellRing’s initial public offering (the “Old BellRing IPO”), which was completed in October 2019, our subsidiary BellRing LLC was the holder of Post’s active nutrition business, which had been comprised of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing. Old BellRing held the voting membership unit of BellRing LLC (which represented the power to appoint and remove the members of the board of managers of BellRing LLC and no economic interest). Post held one share of the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67% of the voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing, with the holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock holding 33% of the voting power. Immediately prior to completion of the Spin-off, Post owned 71.5% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC, and Old BellRing (and, indirectly, the holders of the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock) owned 28.5% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC. Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC.
Post had acquired the businesses that comprised its active nutrition business in a series of transactions during 2013, 2014 and 2015. In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, Post acquired Premier Nutrition, which, at the time, was a marketer and distributor of high-quality protein shakes and nutrition bars under the Premier Protein brand and nutritional supplements under the Joint Juice brand. Premier Nutrition, Inc. was founded in 1997, and Joint Juice, Inc. was founded in 1999. In 2011, Joint Juice, Inc. acquired the Premier Protein brand and related assets from Premier Nutrition, Inc., and the resulting entity assumed the name Premier Nutrition Corporation. Effective September 30, 2019, Premier Nutrition Corporation converted to a limited liability company and changed its corporate name to Premier Nutrition Company, LLC.
In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Post acquired Dymatize, which, at the time, was a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality protein powders and nutritional supplements under the Dymatize brand and nutrition bars under the Supreme Protein brand. Dymatize was founded in 1994 and purchased the Supreme Protein brand in 2012. 
In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, Post acquired the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International (then known as Powerbar Europe GmbH). The PowerBar brand was founded in 1986. 
Our Organizational Structure
As a result of the Spin-off:
•We became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder. 
•Old BellRing is our wholly-owned subsidiary.
•As of September 30, 2022, all of our membership interests in BellRing LLC were contributed to Old BellRing such that Old BellRing is now the sole equity member of BellRing LLC. 
Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19,397,339 shares, or approximately 14.2%, of BellRing Common Stock. On August 11, 2022, Post disposed of 14,800,000 shares of BellRing Common Stock, which resulted in Post owning 4,597,339 shares, or approximately 3.4%, of BellRing Common Stock.
See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report and Notes 1 and 14 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about the Spin-off.
Our Industry 
We operate in the global convenient nutrition category, a rapidly-growing and on-trend category within the food and beverage industry. The U.S. is our primary market and is the largest and most developed market in the world for our category. We believe the U.S. convenient nutrition category can be broken down into four key consumer need states as defined by our management: everyday nutrition, adult nutrition, sports nutrition and weight management. 
While we believe most brands in the convenient nutrition category are positioned to appeal to consumers primarily in one need state, Premier Protein has developed brand equities and product value propositions to appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. We primarily compete in the everyday nutrition and sports nutrition consumer need states, but also appeal to the adult nutrition and weight management consumer need states. We define everyday nutrition as nutritious products that can be 
Table of Contents
consumed throughout the day as part of a healthy lifestyle. Our Dymatize brand is focused primarily on sports nutrition, which we define as consumers looking to supplement sports endurance and body building needs. 
Brand Overview 
Our primary brands, based on fiscal 2022 sales, are Premier Protein and Dymatize. Together our brands cover the major product forms in the convenient nutrition category and appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. Our percentage of net sales by brand for our year ended September 30, 2022 were as follows: Premier Protein, 81.0%; Dymatize, 15.4%; and other, 3.6%.
Three product forms accounted for the substantial majority of our fiscal 2022 net sales. In our year ended September 30, 2022, RTD protein shakes and other RTD beverages were 79.0% of our net sales, powders were 17.7% of our net sales and nutrition bars were 2.6% of our net sales. 
Premier Protein 
Our largest brand, Premier Protein, is a leading mainstream, lifestyle brand. Premier Protein’s product portfolio consists of RTD protein shakes, refreshing protein beverages and protein powders. Premier Protein’s flagship RTD protein shakes are available in 14 flavors (including 3 seasonal flavors) and contain 30 grams of protein with only one gram of sugar and 160 calories. They are gluten- and soy-free, low fat and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals. The brand’s Premier Protein with Oats shake line adds more balanced nutrition with 20 grams of protein plus 7 grams of fiber and can be enjoyed both hot and cold. Our RTD protein shakes are formulated to deliver great-tasting, leading protein levels while maintaining one of the leanest nutritional profiles in the category (as measured by sugar and calorie content). Premier Protein’s powder portfolio consists of 100% whey protein products. We believe the product profile appeals to consumers across age ranges in all four need states.
Dymatize 
Our Dymatize brand is a market leader targeting fitness enthusiasts who value the brand for its science-based product development, athletic performance focus and great taste. The brand’s portfolio includes an assortment of sports nutrition products, including protein powders. The majority of Dymatize’s sales are generated through protein powders. Our protein powder portfolio consists of three primary products: ISO.100 made with hydrolyzed 100% Whey Protein Isolate, Elite 100% Whey and Super Mass Gainer. ISO.100, the brand’s flagship product, has a global reach with sales in more than seventy countries. In addition to ISO.100, Dymatize offers a suite of products to meet the needs of athletes. Dymatize products are sold in a variety of retail channels including specialty, FDM, club and eCommerce.
Our Customers
Our customers are predominantly club stores, FDM customers, online retailers, specialty retailers, convenience stores and distributors. We sell our products domestically and in more than seventy countries globally. Our U.S. business represented 88.7% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2022 and our international business represented 11.3% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2022. 
Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart (which includes its affiliates, including Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 63.5% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2022. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2022 net sales.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
In the U.S., we utilize a direct sales force in multiple channels, including club, FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through a broker network for customers in the convenience, grocery and mass channels, and through distributors for the specialty channel. In international markets, we sell our products through a combination of direct sales to retailers and to third party distributors. We utilize a direct sales force in key markets in the Western Europe for multiple channels, including specialty, FDM and eCommerce. We also sell through distributors in the specialty channel.
We maintain a dedicated multi-faceted and consumer-driven marketing strategy for each of our primary brands, tailoring initiatives to each brand’s target audience. Each of our brands maintains a presence across all major social media platforms. 
Premier Protein. Premier Protein’s marketing strategy is aimed at accelerating the brand’s positioning as a lifestyle brand for mainstream consumers. Premier Protein’s marketing initiatives are focused on increasing awareness to drive product trial and adoption as well as expanding household penetration among this group of consumers. Premier Protein employs a broad media strategy, which includes digital media, search marketing, television, in-store marketing and demos and online dedicated programming. As part of its marketing strategy, Premier Protein leverages its fans’ enthusiasm for the brand to spread the word of our products. The brand utilizes an influencer marketing program called “Premier Shakers” that leverages micro-influencers, content creators and top-tier influencers to generate further awareness of Premier Protein.
Table of Contents
Dymatize. Dymatize’s marketing strategy is focused on retailer-specific programs, online and specialty print media and social media. Social media is a high-touch medium that resonates with Dymatize’s core fitness-focused consumers. The brand also utilizes a social media influencer model, “Team Dymatize,” engaging with athletes. This team promotes product usage via personal social media channels to drive awareness for the brand among its target demographic.
Our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers.
Demand for our products is impacted by changes in consumer behaviors and preferences, and we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, changes in consumer consumption patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic conditions, including inflation. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these matters on our business; however, we are unable to accurately predict their future impact. For further discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic conditions on our business refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report. For additional discussion, refer to “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Research and Development
We continue to improve and expand our product offerings with new flavors, ingredients, packaging and process development technologies. We leverage our dedicated market research, consumer insights and innovation teams, supplemented by leading design firms, product development companies, third party flavor houses and consultants. 
Supply Chain
Raw Materials. Raw materials used in our business consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. Our principal ingredients include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We purchase our raw materials in accordance with rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions, labor disputes, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances. The convenient nutrition industry, like many others, experienced inflationary pressure in our fiscal 2022, which resulted in significant price increases for our major dairy protein inputs. We continuously monitor supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for our products.
Under the terms of an agreement with a significant protein powder supplier, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum periodic volume of protein powder and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of such minimum amount provided the supplier has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. The agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the raw materials to be provided by the supplier, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. The agreement expires on October 30, 2024.
Energy. Electricity and steam are used in the facilities that manufacture our products. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products.
Manufacturing. We primarily engage third party contract manufacturers in North America and the European Union (the “E.U”). to produce our products. We receive products from our third party contract manufacturers for an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced as well as other minor costs. Most of our relationships with our contract manufacturing partners include minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product. We own a manufacturing plant in Voerde, Germany that supplies nutrition bars and gels primarily for the European Union (the “E.U.”), Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the “U.K”). 
We regularly monitor the capacity and performance of our third party contract manufacturing partners and suppliers and qualify new contract manufacturing partners and suppliers as needed. Given the growth profile of our primary products, we continuously plan for incremental capacity, including adding new third party contract manufacturing partners in fiscal 2022 and working to qualify additional third party contract manufacturing partners and sites for fiscal 2023, and review additional strategic alternatives to support our business. 
From three separate and geographically diverse manufacturing locations, our largest third party contract manufacturer provided approximately 64.7% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply for our year ended September 30, 2022. Under the terms of a manufacturing agreement with the third party contract manufacturer, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum annual order volume of RTD protein shakes and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of a monthly minimum amount provided the third party contract manufacturer has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. In addition, under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, the third party contract manufacturer has 
Table of Contents
committed to produce an annual minimum volume of RTD protein shakes. The manufacturing agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the products to be manufactured and packaged by the third party contract manufacturer, the tolling charges for each item produced (and certain other costs) to be paid by Premier Nutrition (and related payment terms), shipping and storage obligations, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the manufacturing agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. We are in the process of renegotiating the terms of this manufacturing agreement, which expires on December 31, 2022.
We regularly evaluate our contract manufacturing arrangements to ensure the cost-effective manufacturing of our products. We select our manufacturing partners based on expertise, quality, cost and location. Our quality assurance team frequently monitors manufacturing partners to ensure our partners meet our rigorous processing and quality standards, detailed in our Quality Expectations Manual, including requirements for third party certification of Good Manufacturing Practices. Our owned production plant in Voerde, Germany is additionally certified to one of the international Food Safety Standards (ISO/FSSC 22.000, IFS or BRC), SMETA 4-pillars (Labour, Environment, Health and Safety, Business Ethics) and OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety). 
Distribution. In North America, our products typically are shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third party warehouses. Products are distributed from third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported by our distribution partners to international customers. Occasionally, we ship products directly from our third party contract manufacturers to our customers’ distribution centers. 
We maintain one third party warehouse location in Germany, which receives products from our production facility located in Voerde, Germany or directly from our third party contract manufacturers. Our branded products are distributed from third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. 
Competition
The convenient nutrition category in which we operate is highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. We compete with other brands, including private label and store brand products, and with many nutritional food and beverage players. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products, as well as manufacturers of private label products. Some of our competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than us. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in our industry include strong and impactful marketing to build awareness of our products, effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. We expect the industry we operate in to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. 
Seasonality 
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins because of consumer spending patterns and timing of our key retailers’ promotional activity. Historically, our first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally low for net sales for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season. Sales are typically higher throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of stronger consumer demand in our second quarter of the fiscal year, promotional activity at key retailers and organic growth of the business. Seasonal fluctuations in our sales and EBIT margins may not be the same in the future as they have been historically.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
We own or have licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our business. Our key trademarks include BellRing®, BellRing Brands®, Premier Protein®, Premier Nutrition®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, PowerBar® and Joint Juice®, each of which we own, as well as trademarks that we license from third parties, such as Pebbles® and Dunkin®. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or Germany, as well as in many other countries where the related brands or products are sold. We also own, or have applications pending, for several patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have copyrights, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and provisions in agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulations in Canada, Mexico, Europe and other international locations, including food safety laws, labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, consumer protection regulations, worker health and safety regulations, environmental laws and regulations and other laws and regulations. 
Our products are regulated in the U.S. either as food or dietary supplements, which internationally may be regulated as pharmaceuticals or other health food categories. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, we must comply with stringent production, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, labeling and marketing standards established by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S. We also must comply with standards established by similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and elsewhere. In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state and third party certifying organizations. Products that do not meet regulatory or third party standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject to withdrawal or recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act in the U.S. and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada, the FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Our manufacturing facility in Germany is subject to certain safety regulations, including the German Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on the prices and supplies of these commodities. 
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.’s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, each of which applies to certain aspects of our business and deal with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects. As a company with international operations, we also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition and economic sanctions. 
Our business also is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater and storm water management, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (“Proposition 65”), among others. Internationally, our operations, including our manufacturing facility in Germany, are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the U.S. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. 
Human Capital 
We have approximately 380 employees as of November 1, 2022. Of these employees, approximately 230 are in the U.S., approximately 135 are in Germany and approximately 15 are in other countries. Our people are critical to our success and we prioritize providing a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and mindset. We adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. Many of the COVID-19 safety measures we originally implemented in fiscal 2020 also were utilized at various points during fiscal 2022, including, where practicable: practicing social distancing, providing personal protective equipment, encouraging hygiene practices advised by health authorities, restricting business travel and site visitors, increasing ventilation to promote air exchanges, placing air purifying units throughout our offices and implementing remote working for certain office employees. In our Voerde, Germany manufacturing facility, we have a comprehensive safety and risk management system in place that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with these policies.
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention
Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to accomplishing our goals and achieving business results. 
Table of Contents
Our talent acquisition processes include diversity training for recruiters and employee training on interview skills and processes to improve our candidate selection process. For candidate selection roundtables, we have a trained, disinterested employee sit in to help mitigate any instances of bias in the selection discussion. We have also expanded outreach to diverse candidate pools and career fairs to enable us to reach a wider audience of candidates, as well as expanding our lens on hiring people from non-traditional backgrounds or career paths.
Providing development opportunities and resources for our employees is another key factor in our human capital strategy. We offer a variety of training and development programs and platforms for employees at all levels of our organization, including monthly development trainings for people leaders of all levels, along with in depth workshops for both new and existing managers.
We check in with our employees through regular engagement surveys, small group and one-on-one interviews and then act on those survey results, as appropriate. Employee-led groups, opportunities to participate in informal wellness activities and philanthropic work are informed by what our employees identify as important to them. We measure our progress and take additional actions, as needed. We communicate transparently with our employees about the organization to keep our employees informed and engaged. 
We strive to develop and implement compensation and benefits policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay and, for eligible employees, we currently provide access to medical, dental and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, a 401(k) plan and employee assistance programs - including mental health - among other benefits.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
We recognize the importance of a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees and are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that reflects the communities in which we live and work that creates belonging. We have implemented initiatives to track and improve our performance in these areas. During fiscal 2022, we also provided interactive anti-harassment and diversity training for both supervisory and non-supervisory taught by outside experts.
Environmental, Social and Governance
We recognize the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG ") issues for all of our stakeholders and we are committed to incorporating ESG principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors provides direction with respect to the evolving priorities of our ESG initiatives and receives quarterly reports with respect to the progress the Company is making against its objectives. In fiscal 2022, we formed an Executive Sustainability Steering committee comprised of senior leaders within our organization, which provides guidance on goals and strategies and makes recommendations on disclosure and reporting guidelines. We also have a Sustainability Operations Committee comprised of technical experts within key business functions that meets regularly to implement programs and track progress on key objectives. We report to our stakeholders with respect to the results of our ESG initiatives on an annual basis, with our second annual Impact Report being published online later this year.
