ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary product candidates to treat patients suffering from central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases. Leveraging our scientific insights and clinical experience, we have acquired or in-licensed compounds that we believe have innovative mechanisms of actions and therapeutic profiles that potentially address the unmet needs of patients with these diseases.
 We are developing roluperidone (f/k/a MIN-101) for the treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we previously co-developed seltorexant (f/k/a MIN-202 or JNJ-42847922) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”) for the treatment of insomnia disorder and adjunctive treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”). During 2020, we exercised our right to opt out of a joint development agreement with Janssen for the future development of seltorexant. As a result, we were entitled to collect royalties in the mid-single digits on potential future sales of seltorexant worldwide in certain indications, with no further financial obligations to Janssen. In January 2021, we sold our rights to these potential royalties to Royalty Pharma plc (“Royalty Pharma”).
 We believe our product candidates have significant potential to improve the lives of a large number of affected patients and their families who are currently not well-served by available therapies. According to Datamonitor, an independent market research firm, in 2021 approximately 2.9 million people suffered from schizophrenia and 2.2 million suffered from Parkinson’s disease in the United States (“U.S.”), Japan, the United Kingdom, and the four major European Union (“EU”) markets of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. There is no approved treatment to address negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia in the U.S., which is a significant driver of the cost burden of that disease. An estimated 69% of treated patients with schizophrenia have predominant/persistent negative symptoms. Negative symptoms also exist in other CNS diseases beyond schizophrenia, the existing treatments for which we believe are poorly addressed in a broad range of indications such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and depression.
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize first-in-class products that address critical unmet medical needs in the CNS therapeutic area. We are pursuing this strategy based on the following principles: selection of differentiated products with novel mechanisms of action that target therapeutic areas of high unmet need and significant disease burden; attention to patient safety and compliance; scientific rigor applied to patient selection and clinical trial conduct; engagement of highly trained clinical trial investigators; incorporation of patient and caregiver insights to drive clinical advancements; and integrity. With the experience and knowledge base of our clinicians and physicians, we have generated substantive data from randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials that support the clinical advancement of these products in defined patient populations and in multiple regulatory jurisdictions. In summary, key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Identify, acquire and develop differentiated products with innovative mechanisms of action based on biological and clinical insights into the unmet needs of patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled data from completed trials to advance the clinical development of our product candidates in multiple regulatory jurisdictions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepare for the commercialization of our lead product, roluperidone, which will potentially be the first product approved to treat negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia in the U.S. and, in the longer term as a potential treatment for other brain disorders in which negative symptoms represent a significant debilitating, unmet need;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively explore collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies to maximize the value of our current product candidate portfolio, particularly in connection with pivotal clinical trials and subsequent regulatory review, approval and commercialization; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Apply our management team’s expertise and current intellectual property portfolio to identify and explore additional indications to investigate with our current portfolio of compounds and to acquire additional product candidates.

Our History
 Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. was formed in November 2013 from the merger of Cyrenaic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sonkei Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These two predecessor companies had exclusively licensed roluperidone and another compound from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”). In February 2014 we acquired Mind-NRG Sarl (“Mind-NRG”), which owns exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301 globally. In addition, in February 2014 we entered into a co-development and license agreement with Janssen, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, in connection with the co-development 
 5


and commercialization of seltorexant. During 2020, we exercised our right to opt out of the agreement with Janssen. As a result, we were entitled to collect royalties in the mid-single digits on potential future sales of seltorexant worldwide in certain indications, with no further financial obligations to Janssen. In January 2021, we sold our rights to these potential royalties to Royalty Pharma.
 We have not received regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our product candidates, and we have not generated any revenue from the sales or license of our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. We expect to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for the foreseeable future in connection with the clinical development and the potential regulatory approval, infrastructure development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 Our Clinical-Stage Programs
 Roluperidone (MIN-101)
 Introduction
 Roluperidone is a compound that has been shown to block serotonin, sigma, and α‑adrenergic receptors that are involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, sleep and anxiety. We are developing roluperidone to treat patients with schizophrenia. Roluperidone has been designed to block a specific subtype of serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A. When 5-HT2A is blocked, certain symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, agitation and thought and movement disorders, as well as the side effects associated with antipsychotic treatments, can be minimized. Additionally, blocking 5-HT2A promotes slow wave sleep, a sleep stage often disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. Roluperidone has also been designed to block a specific subtype of sigma receptor called sigma2, which is involved in movement control, psychotic symptom control and learning and memory. Blocking sigma2, along with blocking the α‑adrenergic subtypes α1A, and to a lesser extent α1B, also increases calcium levels in neurons in the brain, which can improve memory. Pre-clinical findings provide evidence of the effect of roluperidone on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”), which has been associated with neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, synapse regulation, learning and memory.
 We believe the scientifically supported and innovative mechanisms of action of roluperidone may potentially address the unmet needs of schizophrenic patients, which include treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, without the side effects of existing therapies. Negative symptoms are lifelong debilitating symptoms and include: asociality, or the lack of motivation to engage in social interactions; anhedonia, or the inability to experience positive emotions; alogia, or failure to engage in normal conversation; avolition, or loss of energy and interest in activities; and blunted affect, or diminished emotional expression. We plan to seek approval of roluperidone initially as a first line treatment of negative symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and we also may study its use to treat all aspects of the disease, including positive symptoms and relapse prevention. We believe that roluperidone, if approved, could treat the majority of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. An estimated 69% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have negative symptoms, with at least 42% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia having prominent negative symptoms.
 Beyond schizophrenia, we believe roluperidone may possess therapeutic utility in brain disorders where negative symptoms are a core feature of the disease associated with a range of poor clinical outcomes. These potential indications include apathy in dementia, for which we have filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, the majority of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and depression. 
 Future Development of Roluperidone
 We intend to continue development and New Drug Application (“NDA”) activities consistent with the December 2019 draft guidance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) titled “Demonstrating Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products.” As stated in this draft guidance document, where the target indication is an unmet need such as negative symptoms in schizophrenia, the FDA is allowed to consider one adequate and well-controlled study and confirmatory evidence as an alternative to two adequate and well-controlled studies to establish effectiveness. We are moving forward with activities we believe are necessary to support the submission of an NDA for this compound.
Clinical and Regulatory Updates
 Type C Meeting Request
 On November 3, 2021 we announced that the FDA denied our request for a pre-NDA meeting for roluperidone and responded that a Type C guidance meeting would be more appropriate to discuss the evidence for use of roluperidone as monotherapy for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Following the scheduled Type C meeting and, subject to the timing and feedback from the FDA, we continue to prepare for a potential submission of a NDA for roluperidone in the first half of 2022.

Pivotal Bioequivalence Study (MIN-101C015 study)
 On September 30, 2021, we announced results from a pivotal bioequivalence study comparing the roluperidone formulations used in our late-stage Phase 2b (MIN-101C03 study), Phase 3 trials (MIN-101C07 study), and the planned commercial formulation. The planned commercial formulation was tested under both fasted and fed conditions. The study met key pharmacokinetic (“PK”) objectives, and the data demonstrate bioequivalence in terms of exposure across the various formulations. Subject screening in this study was initiated on April 23, 2021, the completion of the enrollment of 48 healthy volunteers was achieved on June 29, 2021, and the last subject assessment took place on July 26, 2021. Subjects were randomized to the four treatment sequences described above in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Of the 48 subjects randomized, 45 completed all study periods. Male subjects constituted 69% of the participants, and 75% of the subjects were white. Median age was 36 years, and all had negative SARS-CoV2 status at the beginning of the study and of every study period with the exception of 1 subject who tested positive at the beginning of study Period 4 and was discontinued. The mean body mass index was 28.1±4 kg/m2. The results demonstrated bioequivalence in terms of exposure between the formulations used in the late-stage efficacy and safety trials of roluperidone with the planned commercial formulation and allow administration of the drug with or without food.
Open Label Extension (MIN-101C07 study)
 On May 11, 2021, we announced results from the 40-week Open-Label Extension (“OLE”) of the Company’s Phase 3 trial of roluperidone for the treatment of negative symptoms (“NS”) of schizophrenia. The OLE followed the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of this trial. During the 40-week OLE, both investigators and patients were blinded to the roluperidone dose received. The OLE was designed to evaluate the safety of roluperidone after long-term exposure. Efficacy endpoints were also assessed during the OLE period. As such, efficacy data collected during the OLE are not placebo-controlled and therefore their interpretation is limited.
 Over the 40-week OLE period, 333 patients participated, of whom 166 patients received the 32 mg dose and 167 patients received the 64 mg dose. A total of 202 of the 333 patients completed the 40-week OLE period. 
 The mean improvement in negative symptoms, as measured by the Negative Symptom Factor Score (“NSFS”), the primary endpoint of the trial, was 6.8 points in the 32 mg arm and 7.5 points in the 64 mg arm. Personal and Social Performance (“PSP”) scale total score (key secondary endpoint) improved by a mean of 12.3 points in the 32 mg arm and 14.5 points in the 64 mg arm, suggesting functional improvement. 
 The mean improvement in positive symptoms, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (“PANSS”) positive symptom subscore was 1.9 points in the 32 mg arm and 1.8 points in the 64 mg arm. 
 Reduced emotional experience, as measured by a sub-factor of the NSFS that assesses a patient’s motivation to take part in everyday life activities, had a mean improvement of 2.8 points in the 32 mg group and 3.0 points in the 64 mg group. 
 The relapse rate during the OLE, defined as patients being withdrawn from the trial due to worsening of symptoms of psychosis, was 15 patients out of 166 patients (9%) in the 32 mg arm and 10 patients out of 167 patients (6%) in the 64 mg arm. Over the one-year duration of the study (including both the 12 weeks double-blind phase and the 40 weeks OLE) the relapse rate was 11.7% overall.
 Roluperidone at both doses was safe and well tolerated and treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAE”) were generally mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAE in the overall group of 333 patients that participated in the OLE were headaches in 26 patients (7.8%), followed by worsening of schizophrenia in 18 patients (5.4%) and insomnia in 15 patients (4.5%). No other TEAE was reported by more than 4% of the patients. There was one death during the OLE that occurred after treatment discontinuation (45-year old male) in the 64 mg arm due to treatment-unrelated respiratory failure. Twenty patients (6%) experienced serious adverse events, with the majority of them associated with the disease characteristics, and only 5 were judged by the investigator to be related to roluperidone. In total, 37 patients (11%) did not complete the OLE due to TEAE, with 25 patients (7.5%) due to relapse-related events and the remaining 12 patients due to a variety of other TEAE reported in ≤1% of the patients. Few QT prolongations were observed during the OLE, were generally transient in duration and only one in the 64 mg arm led to discontinuation from the study.
 Type C Meeting (November 10, 2020)
 On November 30, 2020 we received official meeting minutes from our November 10, 2020 Type C meeting with the FDA regarding the development of roluperidone for treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The objective of this meeting was to obtain FDA input regarding the existing roluperidone data package, which included the completed Phase 2b study (double-blind phase and 
 7


OLE) and 12 weeks double-blind phase of the Phase 3 study, and its readiness to support an NDA submission. The two main topics addressed during the meeting were:
  
1. | Readiness for submission of NDA
---+--------------------------------

 We requested confirmation from FDA that, based on the totality of evidence, the data from the MIN-101C03 (“Phase 2b”) and MIN-101C07 (“Phase 3”) studies constitute substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the 64 milligrams (“mg”) dose of roluperidone for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia and would warrant review of an NDA submission. 
 FDA advised that the Phase 2b study is problematic because it did not use the commercial formulation of roluperidone and was conducted solely outside of the United States. In addition, FDA commented that the Phase 3 study does not appear to be capable of supporting substantial evidence of effectiveness, because neither dose of roluperidone showed a statistically significant separation from placebo at Week 12 in the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) analysis set. FDA cautioned that an NDA submission based on the current data from the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies would be highly unlikely to be filed and that, at a minimum, there would be substantial review issues due to the lack of two adequate and well-controlled trials to support efficacy claims for this indication. 
 FDA acknowledged that the data from the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies appear to show promising signals and encouraged us to continue the development of roluperidone for treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which FDA confirmed is an unmet need. 
 We believe FDA’s comments can be addressed based on published regulatory guidance and precedents. We have comparable pharmacokinetic data for the formulations used in Phase 2b and Phase 3 and performed a pivotal bioequivalence study (MIN-101C015 study) in healthy volunteers to bridge the two formulations as well as one new formulation designed in conjunction with our commercial supply partner, Catalent, Inc., to facilitate large scale manufacturing. In addition, we believe the Phase 3 study has shown that U.S. data and ex-U.S. data are comparable, and that many precedents exist where drugs were approved by FDA based solely on ex-U.S. data. We believe that, in the Phase 3 study, results from the modified ITT (“mITT”) analysis set that excludes patients with implausible behavioral and physiological data from one site (17 of a total of 513 patients) address the lack of separation at Week 12. 
  
2. | FDA’s consideration of both ITT and mITT data analyses from Phase 3 study
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the briefing book for the November 10, 2020 Type C meeting, we highlighted that the exclusion of implausible behavioral and physiological data from 17 patients at one site forms the basis of the mITT analysis set as outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan submitted to FDA before unblinding the study.
 
For the mITT analysis set, the 64 mg dose of roluperidone achieved a nominal statistically significant result (p-value ≤ 0.044) on the primary endpoint, the NSFS of the PANSS. The details of both the ITT and mITT results for the primary NSFS and key secondary endpoint, PSP total score, can be found in the table below. 
  
Roluperidone Phase 3: ITT and mITT NSFS & PSP total score change from baseline scores and p-values
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timepoint | Intent-to-Treat | Modified Intent-to-Treat (Excluding patients from 1 site)
Timepoint | Placebo (N=172) | 64 mg Roluperidone (N=171) | p-value | Placebo (N=167) | 64 mg Roluperidone (N=162) | p-value
Primary Endpoint: Marder Negative Symptom Factor Score 
Week 2 | -1.6 (0.22) | -1.9 (0.22) | NS | -1.6 (0.22) | -1.9 (0.22) | NS 
Week 4 | -2.0 (0.26) | -2.9 (0.26) | 0.007 | -2.0 (0.26) | -3.0 (0.27) | 0.005 
Week 8 | -2.9 (0.30) | -3.8 (0.32) | 0.027 | -2.9 (0.31) | -3.9 (0.32) | 0.021 
Week 12 | -3.5 (0.34) | -4.3 (0.38) | 0.064 | -3.5 (0.35) | -4.5 (0.35) | 0.044 
Key Secondary Endpoint: Personal and Social Performance Total Score 
Week 4 | 1.3 (0.56) | 3.2 (0.56) | 0.005 | 1.2 (0.58) | 3.3 (0.59) | 0.004 
Week 8 | 2.8 (0.66) | 4.8 (0.66) | 0.019 | 2.8 (0.68) | 4.9 (0.68) | 0.014 
Week 12 | 3.9 (0.73) | 6.1 (0.73) | 0.021 | 3.8 (0.75) | 6.2 (0.77) | 0.017 

 FDA advised that their consideration of both the mITT and ITT results would be a matter of review and that in principle all sites should be included in the primary analysis set, and FDA cannot determine at this time whether data from the referenced site should be removed without a thorough evaluation. FDA indicated that we should include justification for exclusion of these data in the future NDA package and provide primary endpoint results both with and without these data.

In addition to the two main agenda items described above, the use of the PSP total score in the label and the adequacy of the PANSS and PSP instruments and related constructs to assess the efficacy of roluperidone were also discussed with the FDA. We have provided requested literature to support both instruments’ psychometric properties to FDA. 
 Phase 3 Trial 12 weeks double-blind phase results (MIN-101C07 study)
 On May 29, 2020, we announced that the Phase 3 trial of roluperidone to treat negative symptoms in schizophrenia did not meet its primary (PANSS Marder Negative Symptom Factor Score) and key secondary (Personal and Social Performance Scale Total Score) endpoints.
 Patients admitted into the trial had a documented diagnosis of schizophrenia for at least one year and been symptomatically stable for at least six months with moderate to severe negative symptoms (>20 on the PANSS negative symptom subscore) and stable positive symptoms. Patients without moderate to severe symptoms of excitement/hyperactivity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, uncooperativeness, or poor impulse control were recruited. We believe these eligibility criteria represent the real-world patient population who may benefit when the drug is used in clinical practice. In addition, patients treated with psychotropic agents needed to undergo a wash-out period of a few days before receiving study drug. These parameters were applied in screening the population enrolled in the Phase 2b trial.
 In total, 515 patients were enrolled into the trial, and 513 patients received treatment and were included in the ITT and safety populations. The trial was conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel. There were 172 patients who received placebo, 170 patients who received roluperidone 32 mg, and 171 patients who received roluperidone 64 mg. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were comparable across all treatment arms.
 The results for both roluperidone doses versus placebo across both the primary and the key secondary endpoints to Week 12 were corrected for multiplicity using the truncated Hochberg procedure.
 The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the change from baseline to Week 12 of NSFS with 32 mg and 64 mg doses of roluperidone compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia presenting with moderate to severe negative symptoms. Neither the 32 mg nor 64 mg dose of roluperidone showed a statistically significant separation from placebo at Week 12 (32 mg: p ≤0.256, effect size [ES]=0.1; 64 mg: p ≤0.064, ES=0.2).
 Furthermore, the 64 mg dose showed a nominal statistically significant separation from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline at Week 12 in PSP (32 mg: p ≤0.542, ES=0.1; 64 mg: nominal p ≤0.021, ES=0.3).
 Although limited inferences can be drawn from these data, unadjusted statistically significant separations from placebo were observed in NSFS at Week 4 for both doses (32 mg: nominal p ≤0.036, ES=0.2; 64 mg: nominal p ≤0.007, ES=0.3), and at Week 8 for the 64 mg dose (nominal p ≤0.027, ES=0.3), and the 64 mg dose was statistically significantly different from placebo as measured by change in PSP at all other assessment timepoints (Week 4, nominal p ≤0.005, ES=0.3; Week 8: nominal p ≤0.019, ES=0.3).
 Overall, subgroup analyses by region (United States and rest of the world) and by age groups were similar.
 Roluperidone was generally well tolerated, and the incidences of patients who reported treatment‑emergent adverse events over the duration of 12 weeks of treatment were 37% for the 64 mg group, 42% for the 32 mg group, and 33% for placebo. Only 42 patients discontinued from the study due to adverse events, 16 (9%) in 64 mg arm, 18 (10%) in 32 mg arm, and 8 (5%) in placebo arm. Two treatment-unrelated deaths were reported in the 32 mg treatment arm.
 We believe the results obtained in the Phase 3 study expand upon the outcome of the Phase 2b study that showed improvements in the primary endpoint and in multiple secondary endpoints. We believe the Phase 3 study’s inability to achieve Hochberg adjusted statistically significant improvement at Week 12 on its primary and key secondary endpoint may be primarily due to a larger than expected placebo effect. Results obtained with the 64 mg dose included an early onset of effect and functional improvement as measured by PSP and suggest that roluperidone merits continued investigation for the treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
 Patient evaluation in the OLE phase of the Phase 3 trial of roluperidone was achieved on February 15, 2021, with a total of 202 patients (61%) completing this phase. More details of the OLE can be found above in the “Open Label Extension (MIN-101C07 study)” above.

Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls program
 The chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) scale-up program for roluperidone is ongoing to ensure consistency between the drug batches used during Phase 3 testing and those that will be available for potential marketing and commercialization and subsequent regulatory submission and review of an NDA for roluperidone. The CMC program requires validation of all aspects of the manufacturing processes required to result in a drug product that consistently meets approved quality standards.
 In September 2019 we entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement for roluperidone with Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”), a leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies, development, and manufacturing solutions for drugs, biologics, gene therapies, and consumer health products. Under the terms of the agreement, Catalent will manufacture and package the finished dose form of roluperidone at its facility in Schorndorf, Germany. To date, Catalent has worked with us to enable the transfer from pilot to commercial-scale production. This has included analytical methods transfer and validation, process optimization, stability studies, and registration batch manufacturing, as well as packaging studies and the assessment of the influence of formulation factors on the product’s critical quality attributes as required by Quality by Design process.
 Drug-Drug Interaction Studies
 We completed certain pharmacology trials that include a Drug-Drug Interaction study, which comprise a standard part of the NDA. We have studied interactions separately with molecules inhibiting two subtypes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). The data from this study show minimal to no interaction with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, and some interaction (< 1.6-fold increase in exposure) with the moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor.
 Dose Escalation Study with formulation employed in Phase 3 clinical trial
 We completed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized single-escalating dose study in healthy subjects to evaluate the investigational drug roluperidone as monotherapy administered at nine ascending doses (16, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 mg). The highest dose tested is 4 multiples of the highest dose (64 mg) used in the Phase 3 trial.
 The trial included a total of 90 subjects. 72 received 9 different doses of roluperidone, and 18 received placebo. All subjects who were dosed completed the study as planned except for one male subject who received placebo and subsequently withdrew his consent.
 We believe the findings from the trial suggest an expanded therapeutic window and a significantly improved safety margin for roluperidone. Furthermore, we believe these data suggest the potential for future testing of roluperidone in schizophrenic patients with an exacerbation of psychosis at higher doses than those used in the Phase 3 trial.
 Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”) Findings
 We completed non-clinical studies that provide evidence of the effect of roluperidone on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“BDNF”) and on Glial Cell-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (“GDNF”). BDNF is the most widely distributed member of neurotrophins in the brain and has been associated with neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, synaptic regulation and learning and memory. Its involvement in schizophrenia has also been described. GDNF is another neurotrophin known to promote the survival of different types of brain cells and has been shown to be essential for the maintenance and survival of dopamine neurons.
 Data from this study were presented at the 2019 Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society on April 11, 2019. These findings demonstrate that administration of roluperidone significantly increased BDNF release by astrocytes and hippocampal neurons obtained from the cerebral cortex of newborn rats, as well as the release of GDNF in cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, data showed that roluperidone enhanced BDNF gene expression at drug concentrations comparable to those observed in humans at tested doses. Based on these results, we believe that the effect of roluperidone on BDNF and GDNF may indicate its potential for disease modification and improved neuroplasticity, in addition to its observed effects on the serotoninergic 5-HT2A, sigma2, and α1A- and α1B- adrenergic neurotransmitter pathways.
 Roluperidone License Agreement with MTPC 
 We have entered into a license agreement with MTPC dated as of August 30, 2007, as amended (“Roluperidone License Agreement”). Under the terms of the Roluperidone License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive license to the lead compound known as CYR-101 (subsequently renamed MIN-101 and roluperidone), and other compounds with a similar structure and intended purpose and other data included within the valid claims of certain patents licensed to us under the Roluperidone License Agreement. The license is for world-wide rights other than certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. We will pay MTPC a tiered royalty for net sales of product by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees containing the licensed compound at a range of percentages of the 
 10


high single digits to the low teens depending on net sales of products under the Roluperidone License Agreement. We were also required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, potentially up to $57.5 million for roluperidone and up to $59.5 million for additional products. 
 In January 2014 we renegotiated the structure of the license for roluperidone such that we are required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of one development milestone totaling $0.5 million and certain commercial milestones, which could total up to $47.5 million, in the aggregate, as well as the tiered royalty payments described above. In addition, in the event that we sell the rights to the license, MTPC will be entitled to a percentage of milestone payments in the low teens and a percentage of royalties received by us in the low double digits. This license agreement expires upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties, upon which we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license. Our obligation to pay royalties continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the 12 year anniversary from the launch of the product in each country in our territory. 
 Seltorexant (MIN-202)
 Seltorexant is an innovative selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist that we co-developed with Janssen for the treatment of insomnia and MDD. Insomnia is the repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, maintenance or quality that occurs despite adequate time and opportunity for sleep, resulting in daytime impairment. Insomnia can be the primary condition for patients or a secondary symptom of, and contributor to, another medical or psychiatric condition, such as MDD or schizophrenia.
 In June 2020 we exercised our right to opt out of our agreement with Janssen for the future Phase 3 development and commercialization of seltorexant. Under the terms of the opt-out agreement, we were entitled to collect royalties in the mid-single digits on potential future worldwide sales of seltorexant in certain indications, with no further financial obligations to Janssen. In January 2021 we sold our rights to these potential royalties to Royalty Pharma for a $60 million cash payment and up to an additional $95 million in potential milestone payments, subject to completion of the Phase 3 program by Jansen and regulatory approvals. 
 In October 2019 we announced top-line results from a Phase 2b clinical trial in which flexibly dosed seltorexant (20 mg or 40 mg) was compared to flexibly dosed quetiapine XR (150 mg or 300 mg) for adjunctive treatment of patients with MDD. There were 102 patients enrolled, each with MDD not responding adequately to SSRIs and SNRIs. The primary endpoint was all cause discontinuation of therapy over 6 months. Mood improvement, measured using the MADRS, and safety and tolerability were evaluated. The primary intent of this exploratory trial was to generate data to assist with the planning of Phase 3 studies; it was not powered to detect statistical significance. Quetiapine XR was used as a comparator, because it is the only medication approved for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in both the U.S. and Europe.
 In May 2019 we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2b trial of seltorexant as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in adult patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to antidepressant therapy, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (“SSRIs”) and/or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (“SNRIs”). We believe these results represent the first clinical observation in a large, late-stage study that a selective orexin molecule can achieve a positive effect as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who have an inadequate response to SSRIs and SNRIs. We believe these findings, if confirmed in Phase 3 studies, will suggest a novel approach to treating MDD with an improved safety profile compared to existing therapies. Approximately 60%-70% of patients diagnosed and treated with first-line therapies, including SSRIs and/or SNRIs, do not experience adequate treatment response, and seltorexant potentially represents a unique opportunity to improve treatment response rates safely in most of these patients.
 MIN-301
 We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301, a soluble recombinant form of the Neuregulin-1b1 (“NRG-1b1”), protein, for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and potentially for other neurodegenerative disorders. We believe MIN-301 has the potential to slow the onset of, and restore the brain tissue damage caused by, the disease. MIN-301 is produced by recombinant technology, which is a type of process that modifies the genetics of a biological organism to cause it to produce a particular product. MIN-301 is a peptide that contains the extracellular domain of the human neureglin-1 beta 1 protein and is produced using an Escherichia coli organism that is genetically engineered to express this peptide. Once administrated, this peptide binds to a particular receptor, ErbB4, which produces certain biological effects. For instance, binding to ErbB4 modulates the levels of certain neurotransmitters such as Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (“GABA”) and glutamate in the brain, which are often unbalanced in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Further, ErbB4 promotes oxygenation and metabolism of neurons and it is involved in the control of brain inflammation, which may indicate that MIN-301 could reverse the damage caused by Parkinson’s disease.
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease improve the symptoms of patients, but none have been proven to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Due to MIN-301’s novel mechanism of action that targets 
 11


neurological deficits, we believe MIN-301 has the potential to address these unmet needs of patients and, if approved, may be used as an early-stage monotherapy as well as a complementary therapy to existing treatments.
 Non-clinical Development
 Results from a non-human primate study showed that treatment with an analog of MIN-301 resulted in improvements in a range of symptoms associated with a Parkinson’s disease model in primates. The results confirmed the beneficial effects of MIN-301 in non-primate pre-clinical models. We believe these data provide support for advancing MIN-301 into clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in humans.
 Optimization of the bioanalytical method was accomplished during 2020 following the completion of a rat pharmacokinetic study. The new bioanalytical method facilitates the detection of MIN-301 concentrations at very low levels which we believe may enable further non-clinical testing of this compound.
 Impairment of MIN-301 In-process Research and Development Asset
 During 2021 we focused our resources on moving forward our lead drug candidate roluperidone and deferred the future development of MIN-301 until additional resources become available. As a result of our limited resources and development deferral combined with the overall market conditions, we have recognized a non-cash charge of $15.2 million as of December 31, 2021 related to the impairment of the intangible asset for MIN-301. We had previously recognized in-process research and development for MIN-301 in conjunction with the acquisition of MIN-301 during 2014.  
Competition 
 Roluperidone: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Schizophrenia 
 Current drug therapies for the treatment of schizophrenia mainly target the positive symptoms of the disease. When patients present positive symptoms and require treatment, they are typically given either conventional “first-generation” antipsychotic medication, such as GlaxoSmithKline’s Thorazine Sanofi-Aventis’ Largactil (chlorpromazine) and Janssen’s Haldol (haloperidol), or second-generation “atypical antipsychotics,” such as Novartis’ Clozaril (clozapine), Janssen’s Risperdal (risperidone), AstraZeneca’s Seroquel (quetiapine), Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa (olanzapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Abilify (aripiprazole). 
 Both types of existing therapies have limited ability to improve negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms. In addition, existing therapies have extensive side effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation, nausea, movement disorders, restlessness, insomnia, impairment of cognitive skills, and prolactin increase. Since schizophrenia has a wide range of symptoms, multiple therapeutics are often prescribed in an attempt to address all aspects of the disease, compounding these side effects. 
 Given the focus of currently approved drug therapies for positive symptoms and their side effect profiles, we believe these therapies are unlikely to be directly competitive with roluperidone, which is intended to target primarily negative symptoms. However, new drug therapies in addition to roluperidone are being developed to address the limitations of current therapies. Several new pharmacological approaches have been investigated. One targets a neurotransmitter called glutamate and the other targets a neurotransmitter called nicotine. Glutamate is the most predominant neurotransmitter system in maintaining the brain in an active state and is involved in maintaining accurate vigilance, attention and contributing to some cognitive skills. Nicotine is among the most predominant neurotransmitter system involved in learning and some other cognitive skills. 
 Specific compounds under late-stage development that include negative symptoms as a target include Acadia Pharmaceuticals’ pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5HT2A inverse agonist (“SSIA”) that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. A Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as adjunctive treatment for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia was initiated in August 2020. In January 2019, Lundbeck indicated they would begin proof-of-concept studies for Lu AF11167, a PDE-10 inhibitor for the treatment of persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia. In August 2020, Lundbeck announced they were discontinuing the trial based on the results of a futility interim analysis, which concluded that the trial was unlikely to achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint, mean change from baseline to week 12 on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). 
 Other products in clinical development, as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment, whose targets include negative symptoms, (although not necessarily defined as a primary outcome of their clinical trials) are Roche’s RO6889450/RG-7906, Neurocrine’s NBI-1065844 (formerly Takeda’s TAK-831), SyneuRx’s NaBen, Avanir Pharmaceuticals’ AVP-786, and Karuna Therapeutics’ KarXT. In addition, a number of academic groups are conducting studies with existing compounds for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

MIN-301: Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease 
 Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are intended to improve the symptoms of patients. The cornerstone of Parkinson’s therapy is levodopa, as it is the most effective therapy for reducing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. However, levodopa may cause unpleasant systemic side effects, such as dyskinesias, and is often used with dopaminergics to manage these side effects. While initially effective, symptoms become increasingly difficult to control over time, and patients experience a pattern of motor complications that include motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, off-period dystonia, freezing and falls. Accordingly, there are advantages to deferring their use to later stages of the disease, or using them with other therapies to reduce the side effects of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia that 50% of levodopa patients experience. 
 Unlike currently available therapies, MIN-301, if approved, is intended to delay the onset of the disease, slow or prevent the progression of the disease or reverse its effects. Since MIN-301 is expected to target Parkinson’s disease, rather than merely its symptoms, and current therapies are not fully effective at improving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease without side effects, we believe that levodopa and other currently available generic products may not be directly competitive with MIN-301. While there are other drug therapies in development that will target the disease, such as gene and stem cell therapy and A2A receptor agonists, the majority of products in development for disease modifying treatments of Parkinson’s disease are still in early-stage development. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary products and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 The patent portfolios for our product candidates, which we own or are exclusively licensed to us, are summarized below. 
 Roluperidone 
 Compound 
 Minerva owns numerous granted patents and patent applications worldwide that provide strong protection for roluperidone. These include patents and applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising roluperidone and methods of using roluperidone.
Pharmaceutical Compositions 
 We own four granted U.S. patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 9,458,130, 9,730,920, 10,258,614 and 10,799,493, and patents in Australia, Chile, Colombia, Europe, Israel, Mexico, and Ukraine, as well as pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, New Zealand, Peru, Ukraine, and South Africa that cover a novel formulation comprising roluperidone. This novel formulation provides improved therapeutic response and minimizes the potential for transient QTc increases – and thus safety issues - when compared to previous formulations. Because of this improved safety profile, it is this formulation of roluperidone that is being used in Phase 3 clinical trials, and it is this formulation that we expect will be the basis for approval in the US and EU. The granted U.S. patents, as well as any other U.S. or foreign patents that may grant from these applications, will expire no earlier than November 30, 2035. These patents are listable in the FDA's Orange Book and would, we believe, bar generic competition during their terms. In addition to the patent terms referenced above, a patent term extension of up to 5 years may also be available.
 We also own pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Europe, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa that cover gastro-resistant, controlled release dosage formulations of roluperidone. The terms of any future granted patents in this patent family would expire no earlier than June 21, 2038. 
 Methods of Use 
 We own U.S. Patent No. 9,732,059, three granted patents in Russia, a single patent in Canada, and a single patent in a number of European territories (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, Anguilla, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Jersey, Turks & Caicos Islands, and British Virgin Islands), as well as pending applications in United States, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Russia across two patent families that are directed to methods of use of roluperidone to treat negative and other symptoms of schizophrenia, sleep disorders, depression, and other sigma-2 disorders or conditions. U.S. Patent No. 9,732,059 covers the use of roluperidone to treat one or more negative symptoms of schizophrenia and will not expire until 2033. This patent is listable in the FDA's Orange Book and would, we believe, bar generic competition during its term. A patent term extension of up to 5 years may also 
 13


be available. The foreign patents, as well as any future U.S. or foreign patents granting in these families, are scheduled to expire no earlier than July 20, 2031. 
 We also own U.S. and EP patent applications directed to the use of roluperidone to treat negative symptoms in non-schizophrenic patients. Any patents granting from these applications would expire no earlier than May 23, 2037.
 In addition, we own a U.S. patent and pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Europe, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and South Africa directed to the use of roluperidone to treat negative symptoms, various disorders (including autism disorders, amblyopia, personality disorders, traumatic brain injury), as well as increasing neuroplasticity and promoting neuroprotection in subjects in need thereof.  The U.S. Patent and any future U.S. or foreign patents granting from these applications would expire no earlier than August 21, 2039.
 MIN-301
 We own a patent family that is directed to the use of MIN-301 for treating neurologic and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson’s disease. This patent family includes patents granted in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom), Japan, Mexico and Russia. Applications are also pending in the United States and Brazil. Any existing and future granted patents in this family will expire no earlier than November 17, 2028. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
 Sigma Ligands
 We own U.S. and PCT applications directed to sigma ligand compounds and their potential use in treating a variety of diseases and disorders, including pain disorders, CNS disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease), viruses, and cancer. Any patents granting from the U.S. application, or any national phase applications that may be filed based upon the PCT application, would expire no earlier than August 12, 2041. A patent term extension of up to five years may be available in the United States.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 In addition to patent protection, our product candidates may also be eligible for data and marketing exclusivity protection in the U.S., EU and certain other countries. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the data in our marketing application to obtain marketing approval of a generic product during the exclusivity period. 
 For small molecules, such as roluperidone, the data and marketing exclusivity period is generally five years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU, measured from the FDA and EU approval dates, respectively. If MIN-301 is approved as a biologic product, it may be eligible for a data and marketing exclusivity period of twelve years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. The data and marketing exclusivity periods in the U.S. may be extended by 6 months of pediatric exclusivity if a qualifying pediatric study is performed or in the EU by 12 months if approval for a new indication is obtained during the initial 8 year data exclusivity period and there are no existing therapies for that indication, or there are existing therapies for that indication, but there is a significant clinical benefit to using the drug for which the extra market protection is sought.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our product candidates are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
Commercialization 
 Except for most of Asia, we have global commercialization rights for roluperidone. We also own worldwide rights for MIN-301. We believe that it will be possible for us to access European and, in the case of roluperidone and MIN-301, other priority markets including the United States, Asia, and Latin America, through a focused, specialized sales force where the population dynamics would prove efficient. We may enter into sales, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties for priority markets or limited to certain territories for any of our drug candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
 14


Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization, either alone or through collaborations with third parties, in the United States, EU and Latin America to sell our product candidates. We believe that such an organization will be able to target the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Additionally, we plan to engage fully with all key constituencies involved in treatment decisions, including payors, patients and others.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC a clinical trial application (“CTA”), had to be submitted to the competent national regulatory authority and to independent ethics committees in each member state in which we intended to conduct clinical trials.  In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) and entered into application on 31 January 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Pursuant to the Regulation, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EMA's Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), which will cover all regulatory and ethics assessments from the member states concerned. Any submissions made from January 31, 2023 onwards must be made through CTIS and all trials authorized pursuant to the Directive that are still ongoing on January 31, 2025 must be made through CTIS. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a member state's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the European Union is, as it was under the Directive, the responsibility of individual member states, but compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation there is likely to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states. 
 There are strict requirements in relation to the labeling and packaging of our product candidates, the verification of compliance with the provisions on good clinical and manufacturing practice and the notification of adverse events and serious adverse reactions. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and other applicable regulatory requirements and medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. A clinical trial may only be undertaken subject to certain conditions. The relevant ethics committee must give its opinion, before a clinical trial commences, on any issue requested. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may not market a medicinal product without a marketing authorization for such product. 
 There are four procedures for submitting a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), in the EU: (i) the national procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”); (iii) the decentralized (“DCP”) and (iv) the centralized procedure (“CP”). The submission strategy for a given product will depend on the nature of the product, the target indication(s), the history of the product, and the marketing plan. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and for those which are designated as orphan medicinal products. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also optional for medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation i.e. new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation that contain an active substance not authorized in the European Union before May 20, 2004 or for which a centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients. The vast majority of new, innovative medicines are authorized under the centralized procedure.
 The centralized procedure leads to approval of the product in all 27 EU Member States and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, collectively referred to herein as the EEA. Submission of one MAA thus leads to one assessment process and one authorization that allows access to the market of the entire EEA. The process of the centralized procedure is triggered when the applicant submits an MAA to the EMA. The letter of intent also initiates the assignment of the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are the two appointed members of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (“CHMP”), representing two EU Member States. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant a marketing authorization. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (excluding clock stops). This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.
 When using the MRP or DCP, the applicant must select which and how many EU Member States in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU Member State. This will be the so-called reference 
 15


member state (“RMS”), for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU Member States, the so-called concerned member states (“CMS”), in a second step: the mutual recognition process. For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen member states at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected member states with the conclusions and results of the assessment. 
 The European Union medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 An innovator company enjoys a period of “data exclusivity” during which their pre-clinical and clinical trials data may not be referenced in the regulatory filings of another company (typically a generic company) for the same drug substance. 
 Data exclusivity in the EEA is 8 years from the date of first authorization in the EEA with an additional period of 2 years of “market exclusivity.” This is the period of time during which a generic company may not market an equivalent generic version of the originator’s pharmaceutical product. An additional 1 year may be obtained where the innovator company is granted a marketing authorization within the above 8-year period for a significant new indication for the relevant medicinal product. 
 The Pediatric Regulation provides that an application for a new marketing authorization must include the results of all trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), unless a deferral or waiver applies on the basis that pediatric use is not relevant. The requirement can be deferred by agreement. 
 When the application for marketing authorization is made, the competent authority responsible for granting a marketing authorization must verify whether the application complies with the relevant requirements, including compliance with the agreed PIP. Assuming it does, the marketing authorization may be granted and the relevant results are included in the summary of product characteristics (“SmPC”), for the product, along with a statement indicating compliance with the agreed PIP. If the applicant has an SPC where such SPC relates to the medicinal product for children for which data has been submitted according to a PIP, a six month extension of such SPC is available. It is not necessary for the product actually to be indicated for use in the pediatric population (for example, if the results show that that would not be appropriate).
 U.S. FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. MIN-301, a peptide, may be regulated as a biologic and additionally subject to the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to allow pending Investigational New Drug Applications (“INDs”), and approve NDAs, withdrawal of a marketing approval, imposition of clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, or issuance of Warning or Untitled Letters, product recalls, product seizures, refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution, including criminal fines and imprisonment. 
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves, among other things, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and significant financial investment, and the actual time and cost required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease indicated for treatment. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, stability, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other items. Certain pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may be conducted after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting 
 16


period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed a clinical hold on the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Should FDA place a clinical hold on the IND, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices (“GCP”), which include the ethical principles that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and that all trials be approved and monitored on an ongoing basis by an institutional review board (“IRB”). Clinical trials must also be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. Each protocol involving testing in U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials, along with all amendments, must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition, the drug is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, generally two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 trials. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website.
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”). Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements. 
 The FDA may suspend or terminate a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if it believes that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or may impose other conditions on the conduct of the research. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. Sponsors may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on safety concerns, a lack of evidence of drug efficacy, evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Under federal law, the submission of most marketing applications is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to annual program fees. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a marketing application or supplement to a marketing application for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks, and to identify any new risks that were not apparent 
 17


in clinical investigations. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA has a goal of reviewing ninety percent of applications for non-priority drug products within 10 months of the FDA’s acceptance of the full application for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA under certain circumstances. 
 Under the FDCA and FDA guidance, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA or a first-of-a-kind, first-in-class biologic, FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless the facility, and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers, demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, and provide adequate assurance that they can consistently produce the product within required specifications, and the NDA contains data that provides substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the indication sought in the proposed labeling. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs before approving a marketing application. After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, limitations on the approved indications, contraindications, warnings or precautions, such as black boxed warnings, distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, or new safety issues arise, a new or supplemental NDA or a post-implementation notification or other report may be required or requested depending on the change, which may require additional data or additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market trials or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, Untitled Letters, Warning Letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of administrative civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications if in their professional medical judgment they believe it to be appropriate, pharmaceutical companies may only market and promote their drug products for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws prohibiting the marketing and promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, among others, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and mandatory compliance programs. 
 Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product and tracking and tracing. 
 In the European Union, holders of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance (“QPPV”), who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).
 All new marketing authorization applications in the European Union must include a risk management plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription only medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, other federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a 
 19


violation. Further, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, impose civil and criminal penalties on individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Further, the civil monetary penalties statute, imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 In addition, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Moreover, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the fraud and abuse laws described above, including certain state laws which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may also be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates, once approved. 
 Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the 
 20


Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors. The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. A third-party payors’ decision to provide coverage for a medical product or service does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage. 
 Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care organizations, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents or biosimilars, judicial decisions and governmental laws related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain governmental or private third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures are passing increasing amounts of legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the ACA, which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may potentially reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to the ACA, as well as to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future.  It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 21


Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 9 full-time employees. In addition, we are or have engaged with a number of consultants and companies, including Pharma Partnering in Research & Strategy SAS (“PPRS”), that provide expertise in the key functions involved with the development of our products. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Talent Acquisition and Development
 We believe the skills and experience of our employees are an essential driver of our business and important to our future prospects. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, and we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. To attract qualified applicants and retain our employees, we offer our employees what we believe to be competitive salaries, comprehensive benefit packages, equity compensation awards, and discretionary bonuses based on a combination of seniority, individual performance and corporate performance.
