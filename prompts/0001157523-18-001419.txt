ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Culp, Inc. manufacturers, sources, and markets mattress fabrics and sewn covers used for covering mattresses and foundations and other bedding products; and upholstery fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily used in production of upholstered furniture. The company competes in a fashion-driven business, and we strive to differentiate ourselves by placing sustained focus on product innovation and creativity. In addition, Culp places great emphasis on providing creative designs, along with excellent and dependable service to our customers. Our focused efforts to protect our financial strength have allowed us to maintain our position as a financially stable and trusted supplier of innovative fabrics to bedding and furniture manufacturers.
 
We believe Culp is the largest producer of mattress fabrics in North America and one of the largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture in North America, measured by total sales. We have two operating segments — mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. The mattress fabrics business markets primarily knitted and woven fabrics, and sewn covers made from those fabrics, which are used in the production of bedding products, including mattresses, foundations, and mattress sets. The upholstery fabrics business markets a variety of fabric products that are used principally in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture, including sofas, recliners, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, sofa-beds and office seating, with the recent addition of window treatment products and installation services.
 
Culp markets a variety of fabrics in different categories to a global customer base, including fabrics produced at our manufacturing facilities and fabrics produced by other suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had active production facilities located in North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina; Quebec, Canada; Shanghai, China; and a joint venture facility in Haiti. We also source fabrics from other manufacturers, located primarily in China and Turkey, with almost all of those fabrics produced specifically for Culp and created by Culp designers. We operate distribution centers in North Carolina, Canada, and China to facilitate distribution of our products.  Over the past decade, the portion of total company sales represented by fabrics produced outside of the U.S. and Canada has increased, while sales of goods produced in the U.S. have decreased. This trend is related primarily to the upholstery fabrics segment, where 94% of our sales in fiscal 2018 consisted of fabrics produced in Asia, while the mattress fabrics business remains mostly based in North America.
 
Total net sales in fiscal 2018 were $323.7 million. The mattress fabrics segment had net sales of $192.6 million (60% of total net sales), while the upholstery fabrics segment had net sales of $131.1 million (40% of total net sales).
 
During fiscal 2018, both segments continued to build upon strategic initiatives and structural changes that were implemented over the last several years.  A number of steps were taken to consolidate and streamline operations, while adding capacity where necessary. The flexible manufacturing and sourcing platform created through these changes has allowed Culp to place a greater emphasis on product innovation and the introduction of new designs to keep current with industry trends.  At the same time, it allows us to differentiate our products and respond to shifting demand trends. These efforts helped lead to an overall increase in net sales during fiscal 2018, even in the face of challenging industry conditions, with both business segments experiencing higher revenues for the year.

In addition to internal strategic actions, both business segments have made acquisitions to expand our product offering and enhance our ability to reach new customers and markets.  The upholstery segment acquired Read Window Products, a window treatment company late in fiscal 2018, providing expanded capacity and additional capabilities for our growing hospitality business.  Since the end of the fiscal year, our mattress fabrics division announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in eLuxury, an e-commerce company offering bedding accessories and home products direct to consumers.  These acquisitions represent a continuation of our efforts to diversify our product offerings and expand the markets into which we sell those products, as industry demand from our traditional markets has been inconsistent during the past several years.
 
We have continued to experience positive responses from customers to our innovative designs and new products introduced during these years.  An increasing percentage of our sales are now based on new product introductions.  In 2018 the mattress fabrics segment launched Comfort Supply Company by Culp, a new marketing effort focusing on direct sales to retailers and providing products to the bedding accessories market.  The upholstery fabrics segment has experienced strong demand for its new LiveSmart brand of performance fabrics.
 
In fiscal 2018, the mattress fabrics segment completed a number of strategic investments in capital projects and expansion initiatives that have been underway for several years. Investments have been targeted at expanding capacity, continuing improvements in service capabilities, maintaining a flexible approach to fabric sourcing, and dealing with challenging industry conditions. These expenditures included expansion projects to provide increased manufacturing capacity and more efficient equipment for this segment, following earlier successful acquisitions. The mattress fabrics segment significantly enhanced its efficiency and its distribution capabilities in both the U.S. and Canada during early fiscal 2018. This segment has also continued to expand its design capabilities with additional personnel, product software, and a new system for cataloguing designs to enhance innovation.  Finally, the addition of eLuxury in fiscal 2019 is expected to expand the addressable market and add an important new sales channel for the mattress fabrics business.
 
The upholstery fabrics segment operates on a flexible variable cost model, with most of its fabrics now sourced in Asia. This division has focused its efforts in recent years on innovation in its products and exploration of new markets.  This strategic focus helped lead to a 10% sales increase for upholstery fabrics in fiscal 2018, reversing a multi-year trend of sales declines.  The acquisition of Read Window Products is another step in expanding our products and enhancing our capabilities, building upon an emphasis over the past several years to grow sales in the hospitality market.  Our new line of performance fabrics has continued to perform very well, adding to our growth in upholstery fabric sales.

Additional financial information about our operating segments can be found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Mattress Fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment, also known as Culp Home Fashions, manufactures and markets mattress fabrics and mattress covers to bedding manufacturers. These products include woven jacquard fabrics, knitted fabrics, and some converted fabrics. Culp Home Fashions has manufacturing facilities located in Stokesdale and High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada.  The division also has a joint venture mattress cover facility in Haiti.  The Stokesdale plant and the St. Jerome plant manufacture and finish knitted and jacquard (damask) fabric. Both of these facilities now offer finished goods distribution capabilities, with a new distribution facility in Canada added during fiscal 2017. The Stokesdale plant continues to house the division offices.
 
Culp Home Fashions had capital expenditures totaling $74 million during the past ten years with especially high spending levels during the past four fiscal years. These expenditures provided for increased knit machine capacity, faster and more efficient weaving machines, and the initial capital required for our sewn cover business, while also allowing us to maintain our leading edge technology through modernization and expansion projects. These capital expenditures also provided high technology finishing equipment for woven and knitted fabric and a much improved U.S. platform for warehousing and distribution, along with the new distribution facility in Canada noted above.

Asset acquisition transactions in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2014 allowed us to enhance and secure our competitive position and to expand our mattress fabrics business. Taken together, the two transactions allowed us to secure our supply for knitted mattress fabrics, an important and growing product category, while also gaining control of product development and improving customer service. The transactions also involved consulting and non-compete agreements that enhanced our mattress fabrics product development and helped to secure our end-markets. In addition to these transactions, we have continued to make further investments in knitting machines and finishing equipment, increasing our internal production capacity.
 
Our sewn mattress cover business, established during fiscal 2013, participates in a joint marketing agreement for the production and marketing of sewn mattress covers and represents a further step in our efforts to respond to industry demands. The marketing venture is known as Culp-Lava Applied Sewn Solutions (CLASS) and is a joint marketing effort with A. Lava & Son Co. of Chicago (A Lava), a leading provider of mattress covers. This manufacturing operation, located near our other plants in North Carolina, involves leased space and a limited capital investment in equipment. Teaming with A Lava has allowed us to have two mirrored manufacturing facilities and greater flexibility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers.  In fiscal 2017, in response to continued growth in mattress cover demand, we entered into a joint venture with A Lava to construct a second location for CLASS in Haiti, and that facility began production of mattress covers during the second quarter of 2018.
 
As noted above, fiscal 2018 marked the completion of several multi-year capital projects for the mattress fabrics business, including consolidating certain operations, expanding capacity, improving efficiency and customer service, and maintaining our flexible approach to fabric sourcing.  The mattress fabrics division also established Comfort Supply Company by Culp during fiscal 2018, which focuses on sales of mattress pads and protectors, and related products.  This platform provides a new outlet for direct sales to retailers for our bedding accessory products.  In early fiscal 2019, we announced a majority interest investment in eLuxury, an online retailer of bedding accessories and home goods.  The eLuxury investment represents our first foray into direct-to-consumer sales, adding a new sales channel and an expanded addressable market for our products.  After completing significant projects to become more cost-effective and efficient in our traditional mattress fabrics business, these latest initiatives have increased the potential customer base and range of products we can sell compared to one year earlier.
 
Upholstery Fabrics. The upholstery fabrics segment markets fabrics for residential and commercial furniture, including jacquard woven fabrics, velvets, micro denier suedes, woven dobbies, knitted fabrics, piece-dyed woven products, and polyurethane “leather look” fabrics. This segment currently operates fabric manufacturing facilities in Anderson, South Carolina; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Shanghai, China. We market fabrics produced in these three locations, as well as a variety of upholstery fabrics sourced from third party producers, mostly in China. In the past fiscal year, sales of non-U.S. produced upholstery accounted for approximately 94% of our upholstery fabric sales. Our China facilities near Shanghai include fabric sourcing, finishing, warehousing, quality control and inspection operations, as well as a plant where sourced fabrics are cut and sewn into “kits” made to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to sell our China products in countries other than the U.S., including the Chinese local market. The U.S. facility in South Carolina produces a variety of woven upholstery fabrics, including velvets and certain decorative fabrics.

 Our upholstery fabrics business has moved from one that relied on a large fixed capital base that is difficult to adjust to a more flexible and scalable marketer of upholstery fabrics that meets changing levels of customer demand and tastes. At the same time, we have maintained control of the most important “value added” aspects of our business, such as design, finishing, quality control, and logistics. This strategic approach has allowed us to limit our investment of capital in fixed assets and control the costs of our products, while continuing to leverage our design and finishing expertise, industry knowledge, and important relationships.
 
After six consecutive years of sales growth, sales declined in fiscal 2016 and 2017, mainly as a result of challenging demand conditions for upholstered furniture, before increasing by 10% in fiscal 2018.  Our higher sales in fiscal 2018 were supported by our efforts to expand the breadth of this segment’s customer base to include more residential furniture manufacturers, including customers in international markets, as well as the growing success of our line of performance fabrics, such as LiveSmart.  We believe our success over the longer term is due largely to a business strategy that has included: 1) innovation in a low- cost environment, 2) speed-to-market execution, 3) consistent quality, 4) reliable service and lead times, and 5) increased recognition of and reliance on the Culp brand.
 
Our progress has been achieved through a unique business model that has enabled the upholstery fabrics segment to execute a strategy that we believe is clearly differentiated from our competitors. In this way, we have maintained our ability to provide furniture manufacturers with products from every category of fabric used to cover upholstered furniture and meet continually changing demand levels and consumer preferences.  In recent years, we have implemented additional steps to grow net sales, including an emphasis on markets beyond residential furniture, such as the hospitality market.  One result of these efforts was the acquisition during fiscal 2018 of Read Window Products, a supplier of window treatments and other products for the hospitality and commercial industries.  This acquisition represents a significant expansion of our production capabilities in the hospitality market, along with the addition of window treatment installation services.
 
Overview of Industry and Markets
 
Culp markets products primarily to manufacturers that operate in three principal markets. The mattress fabrics segment supplies the bedding industry, which produces mattress sets (mattresses, box springs, foundations and top of bed components). The upholstery fabrics segment supplies the residential furniture industry and, to a lesser extent, the commercial furniture industry. The residential furniture market includes upholstered furniture sold to consumers for household use, including sofas, sofa-beds, chairs, recliners, and sectionals. The commercial furniture and fabrics market includes fabrics used in the hospitality industry (primarily hotels and motels), upholstered office seating and modular office systems sold primarily for use in offices and other institutional settings, and commercial textile wall coverings. The principal industries into which the company sells products are described below. Currently, a great majority of our products are sold to manufacturers for end use in the U.S., and thus the discussions below are focused on that market.

Overview of Bedding Industry
 
The bedding industry has contracted and expanded in recent years in accordance with the general economy, although traditionally the industry has been relatively mature and stable. This is due in part to the fact that a majority of bedding industry sales are replacement purchases, which are less volatile than sales based on economic growth and new household formations.  Until recently, the U.S. bedding industry has largely remained a North American-based business, with limited competition from imports.  This dynamic has mainly been due to short lead times demanded by mattress manufacturers and retailers, the customized nature of product lines, the relatively low direct labor content in mattresses, and strong brand recognition.  Imports of bedding into the U.S. had been increasing gradually in recent years, but this trend has significantly accelerated over the past year, especially for lower priced bedding.  The result has been a decline in sales for the major U.S. bedding manufacturers, which has affected major suppliers, including Culp, to those manufacturers.
 
A key trend driving the bedding industry is increased awareness among consumers about the health benefits of better sleep, which has caused an increased focus on the quality of bedding products and an apparent willingness on the part of consumers to upgrade their bedding. Another important trend is the strong and growing emphasis on the design knitted or woven into mattress fabrics to appeal to the customer’s visual attraction and perceived value of the mattress on the retail floor. Mattress fabric design efforts are based on current trends in home decor and fashion. Another trend has been the growth in non- traditional sources for retail mattress sales such as internet and “bed in a box” sales, as well as wholesale warehouse clubs. These sales channels have the potential to increase overall consumption of goods due to convenience and high traffic volume, which in turn results in higher turnover of product. Among fabric types, knitted fabrics have continued to increase in popularity.  Knitted fabric was initially used primarily on premium mattresses, but these products are now being placed increasingly on mattresses at mid-range to lower retail price points.
 
Overview of Residential and Commercial Furniture Industry
 
Sales of residential and commercial furniture were both severely affected by the global economic downturn in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and have now been in recovery for several years along with the overall economy. The pace of recovery, however, has been uneven and often weak in recent years. In general, sales of residential furniture are influenced significantly by the housing industry and by trends in home sales and household formations, while demand for commercial furniture generally reflects economic trends affecting businesses.
 
The sourcing of components and fully assembled furniture from overseas continues to play a major role in the furniture industry. By far, the largest source for these imports continues to be China. Imports of upholstery fabric, both in roll and in “kit” form, have also had a significant impact on the market for upholstery fabrics in recent years. Fabrics entering the U.S. from China and other low labor cost countries have resulted in increased price competition in the upholstery fabric and upholstered furniture markets.
 
In general, the residential furniture industry has been consolidating for several years. The result of this trend is fewer, but larger, customers for marketers of upholstery fabrics. Intense price competition continues to be an important consideration for both residential and commercial furniture.

Products
 
As described above, our products include mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, which are our identified operating segments. These fabrics are sold in roll form and as sewn mattress covers by the mattress fabrics segment, and in roll form and as cut and sewn kits by the upholstery fabrics segment.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Mattress fabrics segment sales constituted 60% to 62% of our total net sales in each of the past three fiscal years. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at prices generally ranging from $1.50 to more than $10.00 per yard.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Upholstery fabrics segment sales totaled 38% to 40% of our sales for each of the past three fiscal years. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at “good” and “better” prices, generally ranging from $3.00 to $10.00 per yard.

Manufacturing and Sourcing
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Our mattress fabrics segment operates four manufacturing plants, with two located in North Carolina, one in St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada and a joint venture facility in Haiti.  Over the past ten fiscal years, we made capital expenditures of approximately $74 million to consolidate our production facilities and to modernize both knit and weaving equipment, enhance and provide knit and woven finishing capabilities, and expand capacity. The result has been an increase in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating costs, as well as expanded product offerings and capacity.
 
Jacquard mattress fabrics and knitted fabrics are produced at both our Stokesdale facility and our St. Jerome plant.  The majority of finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, with the St. Jerome plant providing additional capacity for knit finishing and inspection, along with distribution capabilities.  We have a joint marketing arrangement with a producer of sewn mattress covers for bedding.  This arrangement includes an additional manufacturing facility to produce and market sewn mattress covers.  The mattress cover operation has been further expanded through a joint venture mattress cover facility in Haiti, which began production during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  In early fiscal 2019, we added an e-commerce manufacturing facility and distribution location in connection with our acquisition of eLuxury.
 
In addition to the mattress fabrics we manufacture, we have important supply arrangements in place that allow us to source mattress fabric from strategic suppliers. A portion of our woven jacquard fabric and knitted fabric is obtained from a supplier located in Turkey, based on designs and a production schedule created by Culp. We are also sourcing some Culp-designed knitted fabrics, certain converted fabric products, and sewn mattress covers using our Culp China platform.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The upholstery fabrics division currently operates two manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and three in China.  One of the U.S. plants is our recently acquired window treatments production facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.  The other U.S. plant is located in Anderson, South Carolina, and mainly produces velvet upholstery fabrics with some production of certain decorative fabrics.  The company announced in early fiscal 2019 that the Anderson plant would be phased out and closed during the first half of the current fiscal year.
 
Our upholstery manufacturing facilities in China are all located within the same industrial area near Shanghai. At these facilities, we apply value-added finishing processes to fabrics sourced from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we inspect sourced fabric there as well. In addition, the Shanghai operations include facilities where sourced fabric is cut and sewn to provide “kits” that are designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by our customers.
 
A large portion of our upholstery fabric products, as well as certain elements of our production processes, are being sourced from outside suppliers. Our facilities in China provide a base from which to access a variety of products, including certain fabrics (such as micro denier suedes and polyurethane fabrics) that are not produced anywhere within the U.S. We have found opportunities to develop significant relationships with key overseas suppliers in China that allow us to source products on a cost-effective basis, while limiting our investment of capital in manufacturing assets. We source unfinished and finished fabrics, as well as a portion of our cut and sewn kits, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China who are willing to commit significant capacity to meet our needs while working with our product development team to meet the demands of our customers. We also source a portion of our yarns for our U.S. operation through our China facilities. The remainder of our yarn is obtained from other suppliers around the world.
 
Product Design and Styling
 
Consumer tastes and preferences related to bedding and upholstered furniture change over time. The use of new fabrics and creative designs remains an important consideration for manufacturers to distinguish their products at retail and to capitalize on changes in preferred colors, patterns and textures. Culp’s success is largely dependent on our ability to market fabrics with appealing designs and patterns. The process of developing new designs involves maintaining an awareness of broad fashion and color trends both in the United States and internationally.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Design innovation is a very important element of producing mattress fabrics.  We invest significant resources to stay ahead of current design trends, including maintaining a trained and active design staff, investing in research and development activities such as participation in international design shows, and implementing systems for creating and cataloguing new designs. Price point delineation is accomplished through fabric quality as well as variation in design. Additionally, consumers are drawn to the mattress that is the most visually appealing when walking into a retail showroom. Fiber differentiation also plays an important part in design. For example, rayon, organic cotton, and other special fibers are incorporated into the design process to allow the retailer to offer consumers additional benefits related to their sleeping experience. Similarly, many fabrics contain special production finishes that enhance fabric performance.
 
 10
 

Mattress fabric designs are not routinely introduced on a scheduled season. Designs are typically introduced upon the request of the customer as they plan introductions to retailers. Additionally, we work closely with our customers on new design offerings around the major furniture markets such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and High Point, North Carolina.
 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The company has developed an upholstery fabrics design and product development team (with staff located in the U.S. and in China) with a primary focus on value in designing body cloths, while promoting style leadership with pillow fabrics and color. Our design staff travels regularly to international trade and design shows to maintain familiarity with current design and fashion trends. The team searches continually for new ideas and for the best sources of raw materials, yarns, and fabrics, utilizing a supply network located mostly in China. Using these design elements, they develop product offerings using ideas and materials that take both fashion trends and cost considerations into account to offer products designed to meet the needs of furniture manufacturers and ultimately the desires of consumers.
 
Upholstery fabric designs are introduced at major fabric trade conferences that occur twice a year in the United States (June and December). In recent years we have become more aggressive in registering copyrights for popular fabric patterns and taking steps to discourage the illegal copying of our proprietary designs.
 
Distribution
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The vast majority of our shipments of mattress fabrics originate from our facilities in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and we have additional distribution capabilities in Canada and China. Through arrangements with major customers and in accordance with industry practice, we maintain a significant inventory of mattress fabrics at our distribution facility in Stokesdale (“make to stock”), so that products may be shipped to customers with short lead times and on a “just in time” basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
A majority of our upholstery fabrics are marketed on a “make to order” basis and are shipped directly from our distribution facilities in Burlington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China. In addition to “make to order” distribution, an inventory of a limited number of fabric patterns is held at our distribution facilities in Burlington and Shanghai from which our customers can obtain quick delivery of sourced fabrics through a program known as “Culp Express.”

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of mattress fabric production costs. The mattress fabrics segment purchases primarily synthetic yarns (polyester, polypropylene, and rayon), certain greige (unfinished) goods, latex adhesives, laminates, dyes, and other chemicals. Most of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products. The mattress fabrics segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of upholstery fabric manufacturing costs for products the company manufactures. This segment purchases synthetic yarns (polyester, acrylic, rayon, and polypropylene), latex adhesives, dyes, and other chemicals from various suppliers.
 
Increased reliance by both our U.S. and China upholstery operations on outside suppliers for basic production needs such as base fabrics, yarns, and finishing services has caused the upholstery fabrics segment to become more vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control.
 
Both Segments
 
Many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs can be sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. From fiscal 2015 and continuing into fiscal 2018, our profitability was aided by lower raw material prices due to lower oil prices, among other factors.  Later in fiscal 2018, we began to experience higher raw material prices.
Seasonality
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The mattress fabrics business and the bedding industry in general are slightly seasonal, with sales being the highest in early spring and late summer, with another peak in mid-winter.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The upholstery fabrics business today is less seasonal than it once was.  In the past, seasonality resulted from one-week closings of our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of most of our customers in the United States during our first and third fiscal quarters for the holiday weeks of July 4th and Christmas.  This effect has become much less pronounced as a larger portion of our fabrics are produced or sold in locations outside of the U.S.  The timing of the Chinese National Holiday in October and, to a larger extent, the Chinese New Year (which occurs in January or February each year) now have a more significant impact on upholstery sales than the effects of U.S. holiday periods, often causing sales to be higher in advance of these holiday periods and sometimes lower during or immediately following the same periods.
 
 12
 

Competition
 
Competition for our products is high and is based primarily on price, design, quality, timing of delivery, and service.
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The mattress fabrics market is concentrated in a few relatively large suppliers. We believe our principal mattress fabric competitors are BekaertDeslee Textiles, Global Textile Alliance, and several smaller companies producing knitted and other fabric.  In addition, our bedding customers are facing increasing competition from imports of finished beds, which indirectly compete with our mattress fabrics by replacing potential sales of our fabrics to those customers.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
In the upholstery fabrics market, we compete against a large number of companies, ranging from a few large manufacturers comparable in size to the company to small producers, and a growing number of “converters” of fabrics (companies who buy and re-sell, but do not manufacture fabrics). We believe our principal upholstery fabric competitors are Dorell Fabrics Co., Merrimack Fabrics, Morgan Fabrics, Richloom Fabrics and Specialty Textile, Inc. (or STI), plus a large number of smaller competitors (both manufacturers and converters).
 
The trend in the upholstery fabrics industry to greater overseas competition and the entry of more converters has caused the upholstery fabrics industry to become substantially more fragmented in recent years, with lower barriers to entry. This has resulted in a larger number of competitors selling upholstery fabrics, with an increase in competition based on price.
 
Environmental and Other Regulations
 
We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and federal and state environmental laws, as well as similar laws governing our manufacturing facilities in China and Canada. We periodically review our compliance with these laws and regulations in an attempt to minimize the risk of violations.
 
Our operations involve a variety of materials and processes that are subject to environmental regulation. Under current law, environmental liability can arise from previously owned properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as from properties currently owned and leased by the company. Environmental liabilities can also be asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation.
 
In addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and analogous state statutes, liability can be imposed for the disposal of waste at sites targeted for cleanup by federal and state regulatory authorities. Liability under CERCLA is strict as well as joint and several.
 
The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that greenhouse gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. International agreements may also result in new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation, and electricity. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any new rules or regulations would affect our business, but we would expect the effect on our operations to be similar to that for other manufacturers, particularly those in our industry.

We are periodically involved in environmental claims or litigation and requests for information from environmental regulators. Each of these matters is carefully evaluated, and the company provides for environmental matters based on information presently available. Based on this information, we do not currently believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on either the company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with environmental matters will not increase in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of April 29, 2018, we had 1,392 employees, compared to 1,325 at April 30, 2017.  Overall, our total number of employees has increased steadily over the past five years primarily due to the growth in our mattress fabrics segment. The increase in the number of employees in our upholstery fabrics segment can be attributed to the acquisition of Read Window Products, LLC.
 
The hourly employees at our manufacturing facility in Canada (approximately 12% of the company’s workforce) are represented by a local, unaffiliated union.  The collective bargaining agreement for these employees expires on February 1, 2020.  We are not aware of any efforts to organize any more of our employees, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
 
The following table illustrates the changes in the location of our workforce and number of employees, as of year-end, over the past five fiscal years.

Backlog
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The backlog for mattress fabric is not a reliable predictor of future shipments because the majority of sales are on a just-in-time basis.

Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Although it is difficult to predict the amount of backlog that is “firm,” we have reported the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog from customers with confirmed shipping dates within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year.  On April 29, 2018, the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog with confirmed shipping dates prior to June 4, 2018 was $9.4 million, all of which are expected to be filled during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $9.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2017 (for confirmed shipping dates prior to June 5, 2017).
