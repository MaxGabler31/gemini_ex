Item 1. Business.
We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel anti-infectives for the treatment of diseases that are inadequately addressed by current standard of care therapies. We are developing a balanced pipeline of product and development candidates, with an initial focus on serious fungal and bacterial infections. Our lead product candidate is rezafungin acetate, formerly known as CD101 IV, an intravenous formulation of a novel echinocandin. Rezafungin acetate has been approved as the international nonproprietary name, or INN, for CD101 by the World Health Organization, and as a United States Adopted Name, or USAN, for CD101 by the USAN Council.
Rezafungin is being developed as a once-weekly, high-exposure therapy for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. In addition, we are developing our antibody-drug conjugates for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections as part of our proprietary Cloudbreak™ platform, which is designed to discover compounds that directly kill pathogens and also direct a patient’s immune system to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens.
We are focused on the anti-infectives market, which we believe has the following advantages for the development of innovative products:

• | a high correlation between efficacy in preclinical animal models and outcomes of clinical trials for systemic disease;


• | a regulatory environment that provides developers of anti-infectives opportunities to reduce development costs and time to market;


• | an ability to commercialize anti-infective products with a focused sales and marketing organization for inpatient and outpatient settings; and


• | attractive commercial opportunities in certain segments of the market, such as the estimated $4.2 billion global prescription systemic antifungal market in which there is high unmet need, high mortality rate and few new agents in development.

Rezafungin
Rezafungin is a novel molecule in the echinocandin class of antifungals. We are developing rezafungin for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. These infections include candidemia and invasive candidiasis, fungal infections associated with high mortality rates. 
We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial, called the STRIVE study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of once-weekly dosing of rezafungin compared to once-daily dosing of caspofungin in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The STRIVE study was designed to enroll at least 90 patients in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or mITT, population, with a target of approximately 30 patients in each of two rezafungin dosing arms and 30 patients receiving the comparator drug, caspofungin. We expect topline data from this study in the first quarter of 2018.  With this sample size, the study is not powered to detect statistical differences among the treatment and comparator arms; the primary purpose of the study is to select a rezafungin dosing regimen for subsequent testing in a statistically powered Phase 3 study versus caspofungin.
Cloudbreak Immunotherapy Platform
We continue to advance our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, which we believe has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of infectious diseases, including bacterial, fungal and viral infections.  We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is a fundamentally new approach for the treatment of infectious disease. To date, we have generated preclinical, in vivo proof of concept data in both our Cloudbreak antibacterial program and our Cloudbreak antifungal program. 
We had selected a lead Cloudbreak development candidate, CD201, a bispecific antimicrobial immunotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Based on preclinical studies of CD201 as well as preclinical studies of antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, from our Cloudbreak program, we have decided to cease development of CD201 to focus on the more promising ADCs for the same indication. We had received a grant from the Combating Antibiotic Resistance Accelerator, or CARB-X, to help advance the development of CD201.  Based on our decision to focus efforts on our ADCs, we will no longer be seeking funding under our CARB-X grant agreement relating to CD201.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to become the leading biotechnology company in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class anti-infectives. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Rapidly advance our initial antifungal and antibacterial candidates to commercialization. We plan to leverage the favorable regulatory environment for anti-infectives to expedite the development of our product and development candidates.


• | Continue to invest in our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of infectious diseases, including bacterial, fungal and viral infections. We intend to pursue the generation of new Cloudbreak development candidates to strengthen our pipeline. In addition, we will continue to establish intellectual property related to this platform, its applications and development candidates.


• | Commercialize products in the United States with a targeted sales force. The anti-infectives market benefits from an ability to address large sales opportunities with a relatively small, specialized commercial organization. We currently intend to build and manage a targeted sales and marketing organization to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States, addressing the relatively small base of well-defined customers for the treatment and prevention of serious infections in both the hospital and outpatient settings. In geographies outside the United States, we may seek to collaborate with other parties to commercialize our products.

Rezafungin
We acquired rezafungin, a novel echinocandin antifungal agent, in 2014. We believe rezafungin has the potential to be differentiated from other echinocandins and other classes of antifungal agents based on its prolonged half-life, high Cmax, or maximum concentration reached, safety and tolerability profile, lack of drug-drug interactions, tissue penetration and high AUC, or area under the curve, which measures the overall drug exposure per dose.
Rezafungin is being developed as a once-weekly, high-exposure therapy for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. 
Overview of Systemic Fungal Infections and the Antifungal Market
Fungal infections pose significant medical challenges in both hospital and outpatient settings. While fungi are ubiquitous in our environment, they are usually harmless for people with a normal immune system. If fungi access and proliferate in the bloodstream, these infections become systemic and potentially life-threatening. Risk factors for systemic fungal infections include recent gastrointestinal surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, central vascular catheter placement, use of total parenteral nutrition, renal failure, solid organ transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and other forms of immune suppression.
We estimate that the annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungals are approximately $4.2 billion. This includes therapies used as prophylaxis (preventive) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital. 
The majority of hospital infections are caused by two fungi, Candida and Aspergillus. These fungi are responsible for over 90% of the approximately 97,000 annual deaths in the United States that we estimate are associated with fungal infections. Systemic Candida infections include candidemia and related cases of invasive candidiasis. In the United States, candidemia is the most common cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. While the limited data available on hospitalized patients varies widely, rates of between one and two cases per 1,000 hospital admissions have been reported in the United States, Europe and Latin America.
Despite advances achieved in the diagnosis and treatment of candidemia, these infections continue to cause high mortality rates. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Disease (2009), candidemia has a mortality rate of 35% within 12 weeks of diagnosis. By contrast, the CDC reports that the mortality rate due to MRSA infections is 12.8%. Further, it is estimated that each case of candidemia results in an additional 23 days of hospitalization and over $68,000 in treatment costs.
Physicians’ options for the treatment of fungal infections are limited by a lack of innovative therapies.
Several factors have contributed to the low rate of antifungal and antibiotic drug development, including a previously challenging regulatory environment that necessitated large and costly clinical trials. As a result, the number of anti-infectives in development has decreased, while anti-microbial resistance has increased due to overuse of existing agents.
The current treatment alternatives for systemic fungal infections, including polyenes, azoles and currently-approved echinocandins, have limitations that we believe may be addressed by novel antifungals. While these drugs have proven to 
4

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

be efficacious in many patients, mortality rates remain high, and the polyenes and azoles may cause severe side effects warranting discontinuation and are known to cause drug interactions that can limit their utility. 
Echinocandins, introduced in 2001, are increasingly recommended for the treatment of fungal infections in the United States. In December 2015, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or the IDSA, released new clinical guidelines that recognize the important role of echinocandins in the initial treatment of invasive fungal infections.  The guidelines recommend a shift to echinocandins as first-line treatment for invasive candidiasis and candidemia.  
The approved echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, and are considered both well tolerated and safe relative to other antifungal drug classes. However, they must be administered daily by IV infusion, potentially extending the hospitalization of patients for the duration of therapy and limiting their use mainly to the hospital setting. Despite this limitation, the use of echinocandins in the outpatient setting is growing at approximately ten percent per year, and the total days of therapy for this class are shifting from inpatient to outpatient therapy. This trend is reflective of an increased need for broad spectrum Candida coverage, increasing azole resistance and complications due to the complexity of patients, and a financial incentive to discharge patients earlier to reduce hospital costs.
In addition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, reports that certain species of Candida are becoming increasingly resistant to available antifungals, such as the azoles and approved echinocandins. Widespread usage of antifungals in the azole class, in particular, has stimulated an increase in resistance.  Non-albicans Candida, which have a higher rate of azole resistance, now cause approximately two-thirds of candidemia cases in the US. In a recent study of cancer patients with Candida infections from MD Anderson Cancer Center, patient prognosis was inversely correlated with resistance to caspofungin. Patients infected with the most drug-sensitive strains had a 28-day survival rate of 75% compared to only 25% for those with caspofungin-resistant strains.
In order to be effective, an echinocandin drug should be present early in therapy at an exposure that is as high as is safely possible. The key pharmacokinetic parameters affecting exposure include the drug’s half-life, C max and AUC. The maximum dose that can be used is based on the drug’s overall safety profile. With echinocandin drugs, high drug exposures early in therapy, as measured by C max or AUC, maximize the antifungal therapeutic benefit of these drugs. 
When a fungus starts to develop resistance to a drug, the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, rises, which means that a higher drug exposure will be required in order for the drug to have the same efficacy as it has against sensitive strains. Having a C max and an AUC that are far greater than the starting MIC provides the best chance of treating infections caused by strains resistant to other antifungals, including other echinocandins. A recent analysis suggests that micafungin, the market leader in the US, achieves only 85% target attainment, meaning that 15% of the time, not enough drug is available to sufficiently kill Candida albicans. Additionally, the EU label for caspofungin requires higher doses in obese patients, suggesting pharmacokinetics are not optimized.
Despite the widespread continued use of each class of antifungals, we believe that market opportunities exist for novel therapeutics which combine the spectrum and safety of the echinocandins with a more convenient dosing schedule enabled by improved pharmacokinetic characteristics.
Our Solution—Rezafungin for the Treatment and Prevention of Serious Fungal Infections
Due to its novel chemical structure, rezafungin has a prolonged half-life, a high Cmax and a high AUC. In addition, rezafungin was tested in vitro against 23 echinocandin-non-susceptible Candida isolates and demonstrated equivalent or greater potency against these strains compared to caspofungin, with up to eight-fold greater potency for several isolates. Rezafungin was also tested in vitro against 100 isolates of Candida auris, a highly resistant emerging strain, including nine isolates that were resistant to other echinocandins, and showed equivalent or better potency than the currently available echinocandins, with up to eight-fold greater average potency against the echinocandin-resistant strains than the other echinocandins. 
These factors are in contrast to all other echinocandins, and we believe they can allow rezafungin to be developed as a once-weekly IV therapy for the treatment and prevention of systemic fungal infections. We are developing rezafungin to overcome the limitations of the echinocandin class and other antifungals by offering the following key benefits.

• | Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that rezafungin can be used to treat fungal infections caused by drug-resistant fungi, including those currently resistant to echinocandins, due to its potency against resistant strains and its higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy. We expect that this higher exposure early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.


• | Single-agent treatment. Rather than treating patients with an IV echinocandin followed by an oral azole solely to enable earlier hospital discharge, rezafungin would enable extended single-agent echinocandin treatment for the full course of therapy, thereby enabling treatment that is consistent with current guidance in the United States and European Union.

5

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.


• | Shorter and less costly hospital stays, and lower outpatient costs. Physicians with access to a once-weekly echinocandin can potentially discharge appropriate patients earlier and thereby reduce hospital costs, which account for over 70% of the overall treatment cost of candidemia. Furthermore, early discharge from the hospital setting may reduce the risk for contracting nosocomial infections. For patients discharged on an echinocandin, once-weekly rezafungin could eliminate significant outpatient infusion costs for once-daily IV echinocandin therapy. 


• | Improved compliance. A once-weekly treatment of rezafungin could facilitate compliance by eliminating the need for patients to return to a hospital or outpatient center for a daily dose of an IV echinocandin, and could eliminate the likelihood of patient non-compliance for those receiving oral step down therapy with a daily azole.


• | Enabling or improving prophylaxis regimens. Some patients cannot receive azole prophylactic therapy due to drug interactions or poor tolerability. We expect that once weekly rezafungin therapy could provide for better prophylactic therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis, particularly for these patients.

The FDA has granted rezafungin designations for orphan drug, Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and fast track for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.  The orphan drug designation provides eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval, a waiver from payment of user fees, an exemption from performing clinical studies in pediatric patients, and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research.  The QIDP designation, provided under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, offers certain incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs, including eligibility for fast track designation, priority review and, if approved by the FDA, eligibility for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity.  Fast track designation enables more frequent interactions with FDA to expedite drug development and review.  The seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation combined with an additional five years of marketing exclusivity provided by the QIDP designation positions rezafungin with a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity to be granted at the time of FDA approval. We have also either applied for or are planning to seek QIDP, fast track and orphan drug designations for rezafungin for prophylaxis, as well as an orphan drug designation for rezafungin for treatment and prophylaxis in Europe. 
Rezafungin Clinical Results
Clinical Studies
In November 2015, we obtained data from our single ascending dose, or SAD, study of rezafungin. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of rezafungin in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that rezafungin was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after single doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. Rezafungin exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing.
In January 2016, we obtained data from our multiple ascending dose, or MAD, Phase 1 study. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple intravenous doses of rezafungin in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that rezafungin was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after multiple doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. Rezafungin exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing.
For both Phase 1 studies, there were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, severe Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, or relationships for overall TEAEs. The majority of TEAEs were mild, and all TEAEs completely resolved by the end of the study. There were no drug-related TEAEs resulting from clinically significant hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities at any dose. In addition, there were no safety issues related to electrocardiograms, vital signs, or physical exam findings.
Based on clinical results to date, we expect a single dose of rezafungin to provide sufficient drug exposure for a period of seven days. In contrast, a single dose of anidulafungin provides sufficient drug exposure for only one day.  The graph below presents the pharmacokinetic results from our single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial.

Pharmacokinetic Properties of Rezafungin

Based on results from our single ascending dose trial, rezafungin has a prolonged half-life of greater than 80 hours in humans. Rezafungin has the potential to be safely developed as a once-weekly IV drug for the effective and convenient treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections in the inpatient or outpatient settings.
Rezafungin demonstrated a Cmax and an AUC significantly higher than other approved echinocandins. Based on the higher drug exposure demonstrated by rezafungin early in the course of therapy and high, sustained tissue concentration at the site of infection, we believe that rezafungin can be used to treat some fungal infections caused by less susceptible fungi, including some of those currently resistant to echinocandins. We expect that this higher exposure and enhanced tissue penetration early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.
Clinical Development Plan
We have completed enrollment in the STRIVE Phase 2 randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of once-weekly dosing of rezafungin compared to once-daily dosing of caspofungin in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The STRIVE study was designed to enroll at least 90 patients in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or mITT, population, with a target of approximately 30 patients in each of two rezafungin dosing arms and 30 patients receiving the comparator drug, caspofungin. We expect topline data from this study in the first quarter of 2018.  With this sample size, the study is not powered to detect statistical differences among the treatment and comparator arms; the primary purpose of the study is to select a rezafungin dosing regimen for subsequent testing in a statistically powered Phase 3 study versus caspofungin.
We recently received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that the results of the STRIVE Phase 2 study, along with the results of a single Phase 3 study with a non-inferiority margin of 20%, together with data from our Phase 1 studies, may be supportive of registration for rezafungin in the U.S. for treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in patients with limited or no treatment options, assuming positive efficacy and safety results.
Pending final results from the STRIVE study, and subject to feedback from European regulators, we plan to conduct a single randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in approximately 150 patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis. 
With this Phase 3 study size, we estimate that the total number of patients exposed to our selected dose and duration of rezafungin treatment will be less than the target safety database of 300 patients. For this reason, as well as to maintain enrollment momentum before the start of the Phase 3 study, we are continuing enrollment at STRIVE study sites after STRIVE database lock. This continuation of the STRIVE study, which we call STRIVE 400, will evaluate a dose selected from the STRIVE study in comparison to caspofungin in a 2:1 randomization regime. We have begun the STRIVE 400 portion of the study using the 400mg weekly dose of rezafungin, and we will reevaluate the dose once we have the results from the initial portion of the STRIVE study.
We believe there is significant unmet medical need for a safe and well tolerated agent with the spectrum of rezafungin in the prevention of fungal infections in vulnerable patients, including those undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplant or patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. We have conducted preclinical studies 
7

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

demonstrating the efficacy of rezafungin in preventing Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis infections in neutropenic animals. Based on these studies and in conjunction with clinical safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data, we believe that once-weekly rezafungin could be an effective prophylactic agent for invasive fungal infections in at-risk patients. 
Based on feedback from the FDA and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, we have received to date, and subject to further European regulatory feedback, we plan to conduct a single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant to enable use of rezafungin in a 90-day prophylaxis regimen. 
Based on our interactions with the FDA and MHRA, we believe that our planned Phase 3 trial in prophylaxis, supported by the data from our planned Phase 3 clinical trial in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis and the remainder of our rezafungin treatment program, could suffice for approval of rezafungin for both the prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.
Subject to satisfactory topline results of the STRIVE study, adequate financial resources, further regulatory discussions and the completion of preclinical testing to support long-term dosing in prophylaxis, we believe that both Phase 3 studies could start in mid-2018 and produce topline results in mid-2020.
Cloudbreak Immunotherapy Platform
We continue to advance our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, which we believe has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of infectious diseases, including bacterial, fungal and viral infections. We believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform is a fundamentally new approach for the treatment of infectious disease. The design of the Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform recognizes that most infectious disease is due to a temporary deficiency in the function of the immune system. Our Cloudbreak lead candidates are designed to address this deficiency by recruiting components of the patient’s immune system to the site of infection, enabling more effective treatment. Similar to the way that immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer by redirecting the immune system to destroy cancer cells, we believe that our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform has the potential to transform the treatment of infectious disease caused by a variety of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens.
Cloudbreak has the potential to entail both small and large molecule approaches. In either case, the candidates would consist of a targeting moiety, or TM, that recognizes a cell surface target and an effector moiety, or EM, that is recognized by the immune system. The coupling of the TM to the EM results in a bispecific molecule that can direct the immune system specifically to the targeted pathogen.
Our Cloudbreak development candidates have the potential to feature the following attributes:

• | small or large molecule components with well-defined targets and efficient testing;


• | selective binding to pathogens to amplify their immunogenicity (recognition by the immune system) and thereby efficient recruitment of the innate and adaptive immune system to assist in the rapid eradication of the pathogen;


• | use as adjunctive therapy along with standard of care regimens; and


• | broad applicability in the treatment of infectious diseases.

To date, we have generated preclinical, in vivo proof of concept data in both our Cloudbreak antibacterial program and our Cloudbreak antifungal program. 
Overview of Antibacterials and Resistance
Antibacterials, also called antibiotics, are drugs used to treat infections that are caused by bacteria. Prior to the introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s, bacterial infections were often fatal, and invasive surgery was accompanied by a high risk of infectious complications. Today, antibacterials are used routinely to treat and prevent infection. According to IMS Health, antibiotics accounted for $38.8 billion in sales globally in 2012, with healthcare providers prescribing 272 million courses of antibacterials in the United States alone.
There are two main varieties of bacteria, based on a common laboratory staining test known as the "Gram stain." Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single lipid membrane and a thick cell wall. Common Gram-positive pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus species, and Clostridium difficile. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria are encircled by two lipid membranes, an inner membrane and an outer membrane, with a thinner cell wall in between. Gram-negative bacteria include P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and the Enterobacteriaceae, a family of related organisms that includes E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella species. Each membrane in Gram-negative bacteria excludes different types of chemical entities, requiring Gram-negative active antibiotics to be specifically designed to permeate both membranes.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

According to government agencies and physician groups, including the CDC and IDSA, one of the greatest needs for new antibiotics is to treat carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, and other drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. CRE leads to mortality rates of up to 50% in patients with bloodstream infections. Based on the significant increase in resistance rates in recent years, we anticipate CRE will continue to be a major health problem. For example, CDC surveillance data indicates that the rate of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella species, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, increased from 1.6% to 10.4% in the hospital setting in the United States between 2001 and 2011. In Italy, K. pneumoniae carbapenem resistance rates rose from 1 - 2% in 2006 to 32.9% in 2014. 
Further, a plasmid-borne resistance gene, mcr-1, has been discovered in bacteria that are resistant to colistin. The presence of the mcr-1 gene and its ability to share its colistin resistance with other bacteria such as CRE raise the risk that pan-resistant bacteria could develop. The gene has been found primarily in Escherichia coli, but has also been identified in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae from human, animal, food and environmental samples on every continent.
According to the CDC, at least two million people each year in the United States acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections, and each year, over 20,000 patients in the United States die from these infections. Similar problems exist throughout the world, and the World Health Organization has declared antibiotic resistance a threat to global health security. The development and spread of resistance is driven by the use of antibiotics. Once they arise, resistant bacteria can be transferred between patients and antibiotic resistance mechanisms can be transferred between bacterial species, thus increasing the problem.
Not only do antibiotic-resistant infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, but they also place a substantial cost burden on the healthcare system. In most cases, antibiotic-resistant infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extend hospital stays, and necessitate additional doctor visits and higher healthcare expenditures compared with infections that are easily treatable with antibiotics. The CDC estimates that the excess annual cost resulting from these infections in the United States is as high as $20 billion. 
Governments, in collaboration with the private sector, have begun to respond to this significant and growing unmet medical need by creating governmental and non-governmental entities tasked with addressing the problem and progressing legislation for reimbursement and regulatory reform, and economic incentives.
Our Solution
We had selected a lead Cloudbreak development candidate, CD201, a bispecific antimicrobial immunotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Based on preclinical studies of CD201 as well as preclinical studies of ADCs from our Cloudbreak program, we decided in February 2018 to cease development of CD201 to focus on the more promising ADCs for the same indication. We had received a grant from CARB-X to help advance the development of CD201.  Based on our decision to focus efforts on our ADCs, we will no longer be seeking funding under our CARB-X grant agreement relating to CD201.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture supplies of rezafungin, any Cloudbreak development candidates, and any future product candidates.
Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our product and development candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible processes and common manufacturing techniques. We obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements. In addition, we do not currently have any long-term arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product services prior to submission of any NDA to the FDA as necessary to ensure sufficient commercial quantities of each product.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, rezafungin, our ADCs, our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, our processes and our know-how are important to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position through patent protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, obtain, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and/or potentially licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be 
9

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

commercially useful in protecting our inventions, improvements and technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:

• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;


• | defend and enforce our current and potential future patents;


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

We have established, and will continue to build, proprietary positions for rezafungin, any other product candidates and technology in the United States and abroad. As of February 27, 2018, our patent portfolio included 12 families of patent applications related to various aspects of rezafungin, and nine families of patent applications related to our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform.
For our issued patents related to rezafungin, we expect the last to expire in 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
With respect to our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
Market exclusivity is the exclusive marketing right granted by the FDA and certain foreign equivalents upon the approval of a drug if certain statutory requirements are met.  When granted, the applicable regulatory authority will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication during the period of market exclusivity.  The length of market exclusivity depends on the type of exclusivity granted. We intend to seek market exclusivity on our product candidates where appropriate.
We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for rezafungin for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.  An orphan drug designation by the FDA makes rezafungin eligible for seven years of market exclusivity in candidemia and invasive candidiasis.
In addition to the orphan drug designation, rezafungin was designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product under the GAIN Act, making it eligible for an additional five years of market exclusivity.
Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection in several countries for the Cidara trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our pharmaceutical compounds. We currently have registered trademarks for the Cidara mark in the United States, the European Union, and Australia and pending trademark applications in Canada, and we have a registered trademark for the Cloudbreak mark in the United States for our pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that rezafungin and any Cloudbreak development candidates we pursue in the future, paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of anti-infectives, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
Rezafungin will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for this indication include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.) and Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.). There will be generics one or more of the current echinocandins available at the time of rezafungin market approval, which will create added competition. In addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Mylan Inc. and Glenmark Generics Inc., among others. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that rezafungin will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as SCY-078, which is being developed by Scynexis, Inc.
Cloudbreak antibacterial drug candidates will compete against approved and investigational agents for the treatment of bacterial infections. We intend to develop other product candidates from our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform for the 
10

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

treatment of invasive fungal, bacterial or viral infections. We are aware of a number of approved and investigational therapies in these areas.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our Cloudbreak immunotherapy platform.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States Drug Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production of clinical supplies;


• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure

11

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and

• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually.
12

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months from filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to use surrogate endpoints in the evaluation of the pivotal clinical trials and have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
13

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is received. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for priority review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product and for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Qualified Infectious Disease Products
In response to the growing unmet medical need in the area of serious bacterial infections, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives, including, for example, access to expedited FDA review for approval and five years of potential market exclusivity extension, for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, or QIDP, including antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to treatment, or that treat qualifying resistant pathogens identified by the FDA. A sponsor must request QIDP designation for a new drug before an NDA is submitted. If designated as a QIDP and approved, the drug is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have otherwise been entitled. In addition, a QIDP receives NDA priority review and fast track designation.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications, but it may not issue a Written Request where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an orphan drug designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and 
14

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMs, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMs program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Additional Provisions
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor 
15

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities or marketing expenditures.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of therapies in which our products are used. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan by plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Healthcare Reform
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.  Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, and also increases in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent under current law to 70 percent. Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal or repeal and replace other elements of the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. At the federal level there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and 
17

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Employees
As of February 15, 2018, we had 61 employees, 21 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 44 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 17 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
We lease a 29,638 square foot facility in San Diego, California for administrative and research and development activities. Our lease expires on December 31, 2018 and we have two individual two-year extension option rights. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
