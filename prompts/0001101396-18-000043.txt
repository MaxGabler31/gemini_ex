ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

“Delta Apparel”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” are used interchangeably to refer to Delta Apparel, Inc. together with our domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries, including M.J. Soffe, LLC (“Soffe”), DTG2Go, LLC, f/k/a Art Gun, LLC (“DTG2Go”), Salt Life, LLC (“Salt Life”), Culver City Clothing Company (f/k/a Junkfood Clothing Company) (“Junkfood”), and our other domestic and international subsidiaries, as appropriate to the context. On March 31, 2017, we sold our Junkfood business to JMJD Ventures, LLC. See Note 4—Divestitures for further information on this transaction.
We were incorporated in Georgia in 1999 and our headquarters is located at 322 South Main Street, Greenville, South Carolina 29601 (telephone number: 864-232-5200). Our common stock trades on the NYSE American under the symbol “DLA”.
We operate on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. The 2018 and 2017 fiscal years were 52-week years that ended on September 29, 2018, and September 30, 2017, respectively. We are filing as a smaller reporting company for our 2018 fiscal year end as our public float was less than the $250 million threshold on the last day of our second quarter. 
OVERVIEW
Delta Apparel, Inc. is an international apparel design, marketing, manufacturing and sourcing company that features a diverse portfolio of lifestyle activewear apparel, and related accessory products. We specialize in selling casual and athletic products through a variety of distribution channels and distribution tiers, including department stores, mid and mass channels, e-retailers, sporting goods and outdoor retailers, independent and specialty stores, and the U.S. military. Our products are also made available direct-to-consumer on our websites and in our branded retail stores. We believe this diversified distribution allows us to capitalize on our strengths to provide casual activewear to a broad and evolving customer base whose shopping preferences may span multiple retail channels.
As a vertically-integrated manufacturer, we design and internally manufacture the majority of our products, which allows us to offer a high degree of consistency and quality, leverage scale efficiencies, and react quickly to changes in trends within the marketplace.  We have manufacturing operations located in the United States, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico, and use domestic and foreign contractors as additional sources of production. Our distribution facilities are strategically located throughout the United States to better serve our customers with same-day shipping on our catalog products and weekly replenishments to retailers.
We became a diversified branded apparel company through acquisitions that added well-recognized brands to our portfolio, expanded our product offerings, broadened our distribution channels and customer reach, and benefited from our vertical manufacturing platform. We continue to monitor and evaluate our portfolio, making strategic acquisitions or exiting markets to support our long-term growth and profitability goals.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
During fiscal year 2018, we made a strategic decision to re-align our business into segments that better reflect our operating model and allow us to better leverage and more efficiently manage our cost structure as we plan future growth. With this realignment, we changed and renamed our reportable segments to reflect how our Chief Operating Decision maker and management currently make financial decisions and allocate resources. We are now reporting our results under the Delta Group, comprising our Delta Activewear, DTG2Go and Soffe business units, and the Salt Life Group, comprising our Salt Life and Coast business units. Junkfood was included in the Salt Life Group segment until its divestiture in March, 2017. We have recast the segment information for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, to conform to the current presentation.
See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information regarding segment reporting, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
PRODUCTS
We specialize in the design, manufacturing, merchandising, and sale of a variety of casual and athletic products for men, women, juniors, youth and children at a wide range of price points through most distribution channels. We market apparel garments and accessories under our primary brands of Salt Life®, and COAST®, and we market our core activewear apparel garments under our Delta and Soffe® brands.
Delta has built upon its strength in the market as a core basic tee company to become  a "go to" fashion provider for the masses. After decades of being the source for casual and sports basics, we have continued to expand our brand. Our Delta Platinum collection is a cut above the rest providing a fresh, fashionable edge to Delta's historic quality. Our tri-blend garments add a touch of rayon for an even silkier hand plus a deep heathering effect. Our CVC garments offer the soft, breathable benefit of a mostly cotton blend along with refreshing affordability. In the upcoming year we will be introducing an amazing new cotton slub fabric to our Delta Platinum offering.
Our Delta Pro Weight® line and Magnum Weight® products are a huge part of our heritage. These lines offer a diverse selection of mid-weight and heavier-weight, 100% cotton fabrications. We also continue to provide innovative products like our Delta Soft, Ringspun garments, Fleece and Delta Dri performance lines.

Coast is a full line of premium casual apparel that is as much a testament to good times and carefree afternoons as it is to superior quality, custom fit and maximum comfort. It has inspired us to create an apparel line for others who understand and celebrate the relaxed, yet sophisticated coastal lifestyle and wish to stay connected with it, and COAST, each and every day. Coast Apparel primarily markets direct-to-consumer through two retail stores located in Greenville, South Carolina, and via its ecommerce site at www.coastapparel.com. Coast Apparel products can also be found at select independent retailers.
TRADEMARKS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS
We own several well-recognized trademarks that are important to our business. Salt Life® is an authentic, aspirational lifestyle brand that embraces those who love the ocean and everything associated with living the "Salt Life". Soffe® has stood for quality and value in the athletic and activewear market for more than sixty years. Our other registered trademarks include COAST®, Intensity Athletics®, Kudzu®, Pro Weight®, Magnum Weight®, and the Delta Design. Our trademarks are valuable assets that differentiate the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
We have distribution rights to other trademarks through license agreements. The Soffe business unit is an official licensee for branches of the United States military. We also have license agreements for motorsports properties, including NASCAR. Our license agreements are typically non-exclusive in nature and have terms that range from one to three years. We are not dependent on any single license and our license agreements collectively are of value to our Delta Group segment.
SALES & MARKETING
Our sales and marketing functions consist of both employed and independent sales representatives and agencies located throughout the country. Our sales teams service specialty and boutique shops, upscale and traditional department stores, mid-tier retailers, sporting goods stores, e-retailers and the U.S. military. Our brands leverage both in-house and outsourced marketing communications professionals to amplify their lifestyle statements. 
The majority of our apparel products are produced based on forecasts to permit quick shipments to our customers; however, our private label programs are generally made only to order. During fiscal year 2018, we shipped our products to approximately 9,000 customers, many of whom have numerous retail "doors". No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in fiscal years 2018 or 2017, and our strategy is to not become dependent on any single customer. Revenues attributable to sales of our products in foreign countries, as a percentage of our consolidated net sales, represented approximately 1% in both fiscal years 2018 and 2017.

We have distribution facilities strategically located throughout the United States that carry in-stock inventory for shipment to customers, with most shipments made via third party carriers. To better serve customers, we allow products to be ordered by the piece, dozen, or full case quantity and we aggressively explore new ways to leverage our strengths and efficiencies to meet the quick-turn needs of our customers. Because a significant portion of our business consists of at-once replenishment, we believe that backlog order levels do not provide a general indication of future sales.
COMPETITION
As a vertically-integrated apparel company, we have numerous competitors with respect to the manufacturing and sale of apparel products in both domestic and international markets, many of which are larger and have more brand recognition and greater marketing budgets than we do. Some of these competitors may benefit from lower production costs that can result from greater operational scale, a differing supply chain footprint, or trade-related agreements and other macroeconomic factors that may enable them to compete more effectively. 
We believe that competition within our Salt Life Group segment is based primarily upon brand recognition, design, and consumer preference. We focus on sustaining the strong reputation of our lifestyle brands by adapting our product offerings to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences. We aim to keep our merchandise offerings fresh with unique artwork and new designs, and support the integrated lifestyle statement of our products through effective consumer marketing. We believe that our favorable competitive position stems from strong consumer recognition and brand loyalty, the high quality of our products, and our flexibility and process control, which drive product consistency. We believe that our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, design, marketing, product development, manufacturing, technology and distribution will, in large part, determine our future success.
Competition in our Delta Group segment is generally based upon price, service, delivery time and quality, with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of the particular customer and the specific product offering. These businesses are highly price competitive and competitor actions can greatly influence pricing and demand for our products. While price is still important in the private label market, quality and service are generally more important factors for customer choice. Our ability to consistently service the needs of our private label customers greatly impacts future business with these customers. We believe our Western Hemisphere-centered manufacturing platform enables us to compete with our competitors by providing an outlet for customers to diversify their sourcing footprints and reduce time to market. Furthermore, as an integrated entity with design, manufacturing, sourcing, and marketing capabilities, we believe the interdependencies within our portfolio provide cost, quality, and speed to market advantages that enable us to be more competitive.
SEASONALITY
Although our various product lines are sold on a year-round basis, the demand for specific products or styles reflects some seasonality, with sales in our June fiscal quarter typically being the highest and sales in our December fiscal quarter typically being the lowest. As we continue to expand our product offerings, the seasonality in our business has become less pronounced. The percentage of net sales by quarter for the year ended September 29, 2018, was 23%, 25%, 29% and 23% for the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively. Consumer demand for apparel is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Therefore, the distribution of sales by quarter in fiscal year 2018 may not be indicative of the distribution in future years.
MANUFACTURING
We have a vertically integrated manufacturing platform that supports both the Delta Group and Salt Life Group. Our manufacturing operations begin with the purchase of yarn and other raw materials from third-party suppliers. We manufacture fabrics in our leased textile facility located near San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and purchase fabric domestically and internationally to supplement our internal production. The manufacturing process continues at one of our six apparel manufacturing facilities where products are ultimately sewn into finished garments. We either own these facilities or lease and operate them. These facilities are located domestically (two in North Carolina) and internationally (two in Honduras, one in El Salvador and one in Mexico). Our garments may also be embellished and prepared for retail sale (with any combination of services, including ticketing, hang tags, and hangers) in our facility in North Carolina or our international plants (one in El Salvador and one in Mexico). In addition, we offer digital print and fulfillment services through our four domestic facilities (two in Florida, one in North Carolina and one in Nevada). In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, approximately 90%, and 91%, respectively, of our manufactured products were sewn in company-operated locations. The remaining products were sewn by outside contractors located primarily in the Caribbean Basin.
At our 2018 and 2017 fiscal year-ends, our long-lived assets in Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico collectively comprised approximately 41%, and 54%, respectively, of our total net property, plant and equipment, with our long-lived assets in Honduras comprising 32% and 43% of the total, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of risks associated with our operations located outside of the United States.

To supplement our internal manufacturing platform, we purchase fabric, undecorated products and full-package products from independent sources throughout the world. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we sourced approximately 10% and 8%, respectively, of our products from third parties. 
RAW MATERIALS
We have a supply agreement with Parkdale Mills, Inc. and Parkdale America, LLC (collectively "Parkdale") to supply our yarn requirements until December 31, 2018. Under the supply agreement, we purchase all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations from Parkdale, excluding yarns that Parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints. The purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost. If Parkdale’s operations are disrupted and it is not able to provide us with our yarn requirements, we may need to obtain yarn from alternative sources. Although alternative sources are presently available, we may not be able to enter into short-term arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms with Parkdale. In addition, the cotton futures we have fixed with Parkdale may not be transferable to alternative yarn suppliers. Because there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass along the higher cost of yarn to our customers, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, while we expect to negotiate an extension to the agreement with Parkdale, the terms of the new agreement may not be as favorable as the current agreement.
We also purchase specialized fabrics that we currently do not have the capacity or capability to produce and may purchase other fabrics when it is cost-effective to do so. While these fabrics typically are available from various suppliers, there are times when certain yarns become limited in quantity, causing some fabrics to be difficult to source. This can result in higher prices or the inability to provide products to customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Dyes and chemicals are also purchased from several third party suppliers. While historically we have not had difficulty obtaining sufficient quantities of dyes and chemicals for manufacturing, the availability of products can change, which could require us to adjust dye and chemical formulations. In certain instances, these adjustments can increase manufacturing costs, negatively impacting our results of operations.
EMPLOYEES AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As of September 29, 2018, we employed approximately 7,700 full time employees, of whom approximately 1,100 were employed in the United States. A total of approximately 3,000 employees at two of our facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, are party to multi-year collective bargaining agreements. We have historically conducted our operations without significant labor disruptions and believe that our relations with our employees are good.  We have invested significant time and resources to have the working conditions in all of our facilities meet or exceed the standards imposed by governing laws and regulations.  All of our manufacturing facilities in Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico are Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) certified. Delta Apparel, Inc. is a Category C affiliate with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), which further enhances human rights compliance monitoring for our plants and our third party contractors.  In addition, we have proactive programs to promote workplace safety, personal health and employee wellness.  We also support educational institutions and/or charitable organizations in communities where we operate.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, storm water flows, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Our plants generate small quantities of hazardous waste, which are either recycled or disposed of off-site. 
The environmental regulations applicable to our business are becoming increasingly stringent and we incur capital and other expenditures annually to achieve compliance with environmental standards. We currently do not expect that the amount of expenditures required to comply with these environmental standards will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, while we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Although we continually seek new products and brands to take to market via our diverse distribution network and customer base, there were no material amounts spent on research and development in the fiscal years ended September 29, 2018, and September 30, 2017.
