  Item 1.       Business
  
  Track Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation since 2016 and previously incorporated in 1995 as a Utah corporation, has its principal place of business at 200 E. 5th Avenue Suite 100, Naperville, Illinois 60563. Our telephone number is (877) 260-2010. We maintain a corporate website at www.trackgrp.com. Our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), is currently listed for quotation on the OTCQX Premier Marketplace (“OTCQX”) under the symbol “TRCK.” Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Track Group” or the “Company” refer to Track Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 Company Background
  
  The Company designs, manufactures, and markets location tracking devices and develops and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and monitoring applications. Our products and services include a full-range of one-piece GPS tracking devices, a device-agnostic operating system, a portfolio of software applications including smartphone, alcohol and predictive analytics, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. Our products and services are currently available worldwide and are sold through our direct sales force, as well as through value-added resellers. The Company sells to government customers on federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and to members of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) internationally. Track Group’s device-agnostic platform and expanded portfolio of integrated and complimentary monitoring-related services help reduce risk and make the administration of justice better, faster, and less expensive for taxpayers. As of September 30, 2018, the Company’s products and platform were used to monitor over 34,000 individuals globally.
 Business Strategy
  
  We are committed to helping our customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through our innovative hardware, software, and services. We treat our business as a service business. Although we still manufacture patented tracking technology, we see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions we provide. Accordingly, rather than receiving a payment just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company receives a recurring stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts. As part of our strategy, we continue to expand our device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but also store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for both accountability and auditing reasons, as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. We believe a high-quality customer experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of our products and services greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, our strategy also includes building and expanding our own direct sales force and our third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. In addition, we are developing related-service offerings to address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We believe continual investment in research and development (“R&D”), including smartphone applications and other monitoring services is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions today and in the future.

  Recent Developments
  
  Contract with the Gendarmeria de Chile
 
 On January 25, 2018, the Company entered into a Monitoring Services Agreement (the “Gendarmeria Agreement”) with Gendarmeria de Chile, the Republic of Chile’s uniform prison service (“Gendarmeria”), for services the Company began offering to Gendarmeria on October 18, 2017 for a period of 365 days. As of October 18, 2018, the Gendarmeria Agreement was automatically extended for periods of 30-days and the Company anticipates that this option will be exercised by Gendarmeria for the foreseeable future. Most recently, Gendarmeria asked the Company’s Chilean subsidiary to extend the maturity of the performance bond associated with the Gendarmeria Agreement to July 18, 2019. Furthermore, Gendarmeria will not make a decision with respect to the Request for Proposal process until all of the judicial proceedings are complete; however, management believes that as the incumbent provider with several years of experience managing a successful program for the Chilean government, the Company is best positioned to prevail in such a process.
 Conrent Facility Agreement
  
  On July 19, 2018 the Company and Conrent Invest S.A. (“Conrent”), acting on behalf of its compartment, Safety 2, amended the facility agreement originally entered into by and between the parties on December 30, 2013 (the “Amended Facility Agreement”), which Amended Facility Agreement alters certain provisions of the Company’s existing $30.4 million unsecured debt facility. Effective July 19, 2018, the Amended Facility Agreement (i) extended the Maturity Date to the earlier of either April 1, 2019 or the date upon which the Outstanding Principal Amount, as defined therein, is repaid by the Company, and (ii) provided that in the event of a Change of Control, as defined therein, Conrent shall immediately cancel the facility and declare the Outstanding Principal Amount, together with unpaid interest, immediately due and payable. On November 14, 2018, the Company requested that Conrent extend the maturity of the Amended Facility Agreement from April 1, 2019 to April 1, 2020. On December 3, 2018, Conrent agreed to convene meetings of the investors who purchased the securities from Conrent to finance the debt (the “Noteholders”) and subsequently issued a notice of a meeting of Noteholders for each series of Notes, which meetings will be held on January 16, 2019. Based on discussions between the Company and Conrent to date, the Company anticipates that the Noteholders will agree to extend the maturity of the Amended Facility Agreement before its maturity on April 1, 2019, however no assurance can be given.

  Research and Development Program
  
  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we incurred research and development expense of $862,142, compared to $1,784,867 recognized during fiscal year 2017. The $922,725 decrease in research and development cost reflects lower wages and benefits of $585,641 and lower outside service and consulting expense of $326,118 as the Company is completing its new technology platform, which will be introduced to customers in the upcoming fiscal year. The Company is significantly enhancing its technology platform to improve the efficiency of its software, firmware, user interface, and automation. As a result of these improvements, $1,083,745 was capitalized as developed technology during the year ended September 30, 2018. A portion of this expense would have been recognized as research and development expense, absent the significant enhancements to the technology. This represented a decrease of $1,333,059 compared to the $2,416,804 capitalized as developed technology during the year ended September 30, 2017.
 Competition
  
  The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we are confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of our business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and technological advances. Our competitors selling tracking devices have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. Our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong software ecosystem, service and support, and corporate reputation.
  
  Our specific competitors vary from market to market and we compete against other international, national and regional companies, some of whom use local partners that have more knowledge of the local markets and the government decision making process. Some of our competitors are owned by large public companies and may have access to more resources than we do, while others are backed by private equity firms with large funds, or in some cases, work as part of a consortium with extensive international experience. We expect competition in these markets to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of our products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with third-party providers to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
  Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers. We have developed strong relationships with federal, state and county customers within the United States and with Ministries of Justice internationally and managed to bring in new, sizable customers in the past year.
  
  Industry Leading Analytics Software. Remains a leader with fully functioning, revenue generating analytics software on the market today, specifically designed for the offender monitoring market. Several state departments of corrections, county probation agencies and Sheriff’s offices have utilized this solution for multiple years.
  
  Device Agnostic Software Platform. Our software platform is device agnostic and currently accommodates offender monitoring of new products that we introduce, integrates with case management software utilized by sheriff, probation and pre-trial departments, and adds devices manufactured by competitors.
  
  Smartphone Monitoring Pioneers in Criminal Justice. Today’s prison system incarcerates too many individuals who pose little threat to public safety, at far too great a cost. They serve their sentences in overcrowded, outdated institutions that expose them to hardened criminals. Upon release, their opportunities and lives have changed forever. Now, low-risk offender populations can serve their sentences virtually, holding jobs and taking care of family members, yet still feeling the weight of their punishment while seeing a clear path to avoiding trouble in the future. Further, taxpayers gain a clear cost advantage. To date, we have developed apps targeting alcohol monitoring, domestic violence and our core monitoring platform.
  
  Experienced Senior Management Team. Our top executives have extensive experience in both the offender monitoring marketplace and their specific fields of expertise, whether that be sales, customer care and/or technology. We also benefit from a diverse and experienced Board of Directors.

  Recurring Revenue. Our revenue is generated in large part by long-term customer contracts based on the size of the offender monitoring program throughout each month, which creates a predictable, recurring revenue stream.
  
  Extensive Product Suite. We have a large variety of products that appeal to a broad range of government customers and greatly enhance our ability to attract and retain clients. These products include different GPS devices, alcohol monitoring devices and applications, and new smartphone applications including those that address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors and analytics software.
  
  National Footprint with International Presence. We operate in approximately 42 states as well as select international locations, including Chile and Mexico. Our presence both within the United States and abroad better positions us to compete for new and expiring government contracts.
  
  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
  
  We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of our product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
 Dependence on Major Customers
  
  We had sales to entities, two of which represent more than 10% of our gross revenue, as follows for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively:
  
 
 | 2018 | % | 2017 | % 
-----------+------------+-----+------------+----
Customer A | $9,201,502 | 30% | $8,747,338 | 29%
Customer B | $3,772,540 | 12% | $3,743,508 | 13%
Customer C | $2,468,472 | 8% | $2,326,318 | 8% 


 
  No other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 or 2017.
  
  Concentration of credit risk associated with our total and outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are shown in the table below: 
  
 
 | 2018 | % | 2017 | % 
-----------+------------+-----+------------+----
Customer A | $1,689,976 | 29% | $1,657,316 | 30%
Customer B | $594,626 | 10% | $641,973 | 12%
Customer C | $428,560 | 7% | $394,253 | 7% 

 Dependence on Major Suppliers
  
  We purchase cellular services from several major suppliers. The cost to us for these services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $2,075,671 and $2,178,895, respectively. The 5% decrease in cellular service expense in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from lower pricing on contracts negotiated in fiscal 2018, partially offset by increased costs associated with higher revenue.
   
  During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we also purchased a significant portion of our inventory and monitoring equipment from certain suppliers. The cost of these purchases during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1,305,586 and $1,838,779, respectively. The 29% decrease was due to the shut-down of numerous 2G cellular networks in 2017, which required the one-time replacement of these 2G units and decreased cost of units purchased in 2018.

  Intellectual Property
  
  We currently hold rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We have registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
  
  We file patent applications as needed to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing numerous patent applications around the world. Over time, we have accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. We hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
  
  Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. Although we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses can be obtained in the future on reasonable terms, or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which we compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. 
  
  Trademarks. We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own ten trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus one trademark registered in Mexico and one in Canada. In addition, we have the Track Group trademark and design registered in various countries around the world.
  
  We will file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.

  Trade Secrets.  We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
  
  We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
  
  Government Regulation
  
  Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations.
  
  In October 2018, through an internal review of our export compliance, it came to our attention that some of our products may not have been properly classified in the past, and that our export of certain products, software and technology may be subject to export licensing requirements of which we were not previously aware. As a result of these findings, we have hired independent counsel to assist in, among other things, an investigation with respect to our past export practices and analyzing our classification of products, software and technology. In addition, on October 16, 2018, we voluntarily self-disclosed the information above to the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), and we have taken steps to obtain licenses for the export of certain of our products, software and technology to certain countries. Should the BIS determine that we did violate applicable export regulations, the BIS may, in its discretion, impose certain fines on us for such violations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is currently unknown whether we may face any penalties.
  
  Other than our potential violations of licensing requirements related to our exports, as disclosed above, we are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
  
  Seasonality
  
  Given the consistency in recurring domestic monitoring revenue by customers throughout fiscal 2018, we detected no apparent seasonality in our business. However, as in previous years, incremental domestic device deployment opportunities typically slow down in the months of July and August. We believe this is due to the unavailability of judicial and corrections officials who observe a traditional vacation season during this period.
 Employees
  
  As of December 3, 2018, we had 159 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. None of the employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and management believes that relations with employees are good.
 Additional Available Information
  
  We make available, free of charge, at our corporate website (www.trackgrp.com) copies of our annual reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We also provide copies of our Forms 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, and proxy statements at no charge to investors upon request.
  
  All reports filed by us with the SEC are available free of charge via EDGAR through the SEC website at www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials we have filed with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
