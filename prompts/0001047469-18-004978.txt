     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  General 
         AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as "AAR," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" unless the context indicates otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government and defense markets. 
         Beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented a comprehensive strategic plan to narrow our strategy to focus on our best-in-class aviation and expeditionary services through our two business segments: Aviation Services and Expeditionary Services. We sold our Telair Cargo Group for cash of $714 million, resulting in pre-tax gains of $198.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (and $27.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from the receipt of contingent consideration). We used the proceeds from the sale in fiscal 2015 to reduce our total debt and return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. 
         Through execution of our strategic plan over the last three years, we have succeeded in expanding customer relationships and securing new flight hour component inventory management and repair programs work with multiple international commercial customers and government customers. We also invested in our rotable assets to support these programs and continued our focus on expanding our business development resources. These investments in our supply chain activities have allowed us to increase market share, expand our customer base, and enlarge our geographic footprint. 
         In fiscal 2018, we began the ramp-up for the 15-year, U.S. Air Force Landing Gear Performance-Based Logistics One program. Under the program, we are providing total supply chain management including purchasing, distribution and inventory control to support all landing gear components for the U.S. Air Force's fleet of C-130, KC-135 and E-3 aircraft. 
         In fiscal 2018, we also began providing services to the U.S. Department of State ("DoS") under the INL/A Worldwide Aviation Support Services ("WASS") contract. This contract leverages our capabilities in aviation services, including flight operations, supply chain logistics, and other services. We are the prime contractor on this 10-year performance-based contract to globally operate and maintain the DoS fleet of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. We successfully completed the transition and phase-in of the WASS program in June 2018. We have full operational capability at all contract sites, which include Afghanistan, Iraq, Panama, Peru, and Patrick Air Force Base as well as support locations in Brevard County, Florida. 
         Our long-term strategy continues to emphasize the return of capital to shareholders. Over the past three years, we have returned $82.6 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases of $51.7 million and dividends of $30.9 million. 
         We remain in a strong financial position to further execute on our strategy in fiscal 2019. Both our commercial and government businesses are executing on our many contract wins and will continue to deliver growth in fiscal 2019. Our cash on hand plus unused capacities on our Revolving Credit Facility and accounts receivable financing program was $473 million at May 31, 2018. We expect to invest opportunistically in expanding our comprehensive suite of services to the global commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We continue to have the flexibility in our balance sheet allowing us to invest in our growth. As we generate positive cash flow, we will continue our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders without hampering our future operating flexibility.

     Business Segments 
   Aviation Services 
         The Aviation Services segment provides aftermarket support and services for the commercial aviation and government and defense markets and accounted for 93% of our sales in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. In this segment, we also provide inventory management and distribution services, maintenance, repair and overhaul ("MRO"), and engineering services. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Supply Chain, Inc.; AAR Government Services, Inc.; AAR Aircraft & Engine Sales & Leasing, Inc.; AAR Aircraft Services, Inc.; AAR Allen Services, Inc.; AAR Landing Gear LLC; and AAR International, Inc. 
         We sell and lease a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components and aircraft to our commercial aviation and government/defense customers. 
         We provide customized flight hour component inventory and repair programs, warranty claim management, and outsourcing programs for engine and airframe parts and components in support of our airline and government customers' maintenance activities. The types of services provided under these programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, and parts and component repair and overhaul. We are also an authorized distributor for more than 70 product lines across over 25 leading aviation product manufacturers. 
         We also provide customized performance-based supply chain logistics programs in support of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and foreign governments. The types of services provided under these programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, airframe maintenance and maintenance planning, and component repair and overhaul. 
         We provide major airframe inspection, maintenance, repair and overhaul, painting services, line maintenance, airframe modifications, structural repairs, avionic service and installation, exterior and interior refurbishment, and engineering services and support for many types of commercial and military aircraft. We also repair and overhaul various components, landing gears, wheels, and brakes for commercial and military aircraft. 
         We operate seven airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our U.S. airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Duluth, Minnesota; Miami, Florida; and Rockford, Illinois and our Canadian airframe maintenance facilities are in Trois Rivieres, Quebec and Windsor, Ontario. In addition, we also announced a joint venture with Indamer Aviation which will develop and operate an airframe maintenance facility in India. The facility is currently under construction and is expected to begin operations in fiscal 2019. 
         The majority of our product sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("ID/IQ") arrangements. Certain inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions. 
         To support activities within the Aviation Services segment, we acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft leasing companies, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"s). We have ongoing arrangements with OEMs that provide us access to parts, repair manuals, and service bulletins in support of parts manufactured by them. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are made on standard OEM terms as to

   duration, price, and delivery. From time to time, we purchase engines for disassembly into individual parts and components. These engines may be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to disassembly. 
   Expeditionary Services 
         The Expeditionary Services segment consists of businesses that primarily provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. and foreign governments and non-governmental organizations. The Expeditionary Services segment accounted for 7% of our sales in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; AAR Manufacturing, Inc. and Brown International Corporation. 
         We provide fleet management and operations of customer-owned aircraft for the DoS under the INL/A WASS contract. We are the prime contractor on this ten-year performance-based contract to globally operate and maintain the DoS fleet of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. 
         We also design, manufacture, and repair transportation pallets and a wide variety of containers and shelters used in support of military and humanitarian tactical deployment activities. The containers and shelters are used in numerous mission requirements, including armories, supply and parts storage, refrigeration systems, tactical operation centers, briefing rooms, laundry and kitchen facilities, water treatment, and sleeping quarters. Shelters include both stationary and vehicle-mounted applications. 
         We also provide engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems and design and manufacture advanced composite materials for commercial, business and military aircraft. 
         Sales in this segment are generally made to customers pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders and contracts. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under ID/IQ arrangements, however, the majority of our products and services are procured via definite contracts. 
   Raw Materials 
         Although we generated 60% of our fiscal 2018 sales from the sale of products, our businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in both the availability and pricing of raw materials. We purchase raw materials for our manufacturing operations, including steel, aluminum, extrusions, balsa, and other necessary supplies from several vendors. Where necessary, we have been able to obtain raw materials and other inventory items from numerous sources for each segment at competitive prices, terms, and conditions, and we expect to be able to continue to do so. 
 Terms of Sale 
         We generally sell our products and services under standard 30-day payment terms. On occasion, certain customers, principally foreign customers, will negotiate extended payment terms of 60-90 days. Except for customary warranty provisions, customers neither have the right to return products nor do they have the right to extended financing. Our government contracts may extend several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. The government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, or modify some contracts at its convenience. 
 Customers 
         The principal customers for our products and services in the Aviation Services segment are domestic and foreign commercial airlines, domestic and foreign freight airlines, regional and commuter airlines, 
 4

   business and general aviation operators, OEMs, aircraft leasing companies, aftermarket aviation support companies, the DoD and its contractors, and foreign military organizations or governments. In the Expeditionary Services segment, our principal customers include the DoS, DoD and its contractors, foreign military organizations or governments, defense organizations, and OEMs. 
         Sales of aviation products and services to our commercial airline customers are generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft utilization (e.g., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators, the general economy, and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. Sales to the DoD and other government agencies are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, government funding, competitive bidding, and requirements generated by worldwide geopolitical events. 
         We primarily market and sell products and services through our own employees. In certain markets outside of the United States, we rely on foreign sales representatives to assist in the sale of our products and services. 
   Sales to Government and Defense Customers 
         Sales to global government and defense customers (including sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government) were $428.8 million (24.5% of consolidated sales), $438.7 million (27.6% of consolidated sales) and $489.4 million (32.1% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $304.3 million (17.4% of consolidated sales), $321.5 million (20.2% of consolidated sales), and $366.1 million (24.0% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
         Sales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our reportable segments (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government sales are for products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental agency spending. Our government contracts are also subject to termination by the customer; in the event of such a termination, we are entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination. 
   Government Regulation and Certificates 
         The Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") regulates the manufacture, repair, and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses which sell defense products and services directly to the U.S. government or through its contractors can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors. 
         We have 13 FAA certificated repair stations in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Of the 13 certificated FAA repair stations, seven are also European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA") and four are also Transport Canada Civil Aviation ("TCCA") certificated repair stations. Such certificates, which are ongoing in duration, are required for us to perform authorized maintenance, repair and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Of the 13 FAA certificated repair stations, 12 are in the Aviation Services segment and one is held by our Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated business ("COCO") which is classified as a discontinued operation as the COCO business is currently held for sale. The EASA and TCCA certificated

   repair stations are in the Aviation Services segment. We also hold a FAR Part 135 certificate to operate aircraft for our expeditionary airlift services business. We are also Commercial Airlift Review Board certified with the DoD. We believe that we possess all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of our business. 
   Competition 
         Competition in each of our markets is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery, and price. Competitors in our Aviation Services segment include OEMs, the service divisions of large commercial airlines, and other independent suppliers of parts, repair, and overhaul services to the commercial and defense markets. Our Expeditionary Services segment competes with domestic and foreign contracting companies and a number of divisions of large corporations and other large and small companies. Although certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we have maintained a satisfactory competitive position through our responsiveness to customer needs, our attention to quality, and our unique combination of market expertise and technical and financial capabilities. 
 Backlog 
         Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to derive from unshipped orders or signed contracts. At May 31, 2018, backlog was approximately $1,053 million compared to $519 million at May 31, 2017 which reflects the significant new commercial and government contract awards received over the last twelve months. Approximately $510 million of our May 31, 2018 backlog is expected to be filled in fiscal 2019. 
 Employees 
         At May 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 155 employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We also retain approximately 775 contract workers, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities.
