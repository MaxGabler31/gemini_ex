ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
We are a late-stage immuno-oncology company focused on designing, developing and commercializing innovative, proprietary, intra-tumoral DNA-based therapeutics delivered by electroporation (“EP”) to stimulate and augment anti-tumor immune responses for the treatment of cancers. Our core technology, ImmunoPulse®, is a drug-device therapeutic modality platform comprised of a proprietary OncoSec Medical System EP device (the “OMS EP Device”) and a proprietary DNA plasmid delivery and application method that enables transient expression of recombinant therapeutic molecules in cells. The OMS EP Device is designed to promote cellular uptake of plasmid DNA injected directly into solid tumors to allow subsequent expression of the encoded therapeutic protein. Our OMS EP Device can be adapted to treat different tumor types, and consists of an electrical pulse generator paired with disposable applicators. Our lead product candidate is a plasmid encoding interleukin-12 (“IL-12”) called tavokinogene telseplasmid (“TAVO™”). The OMS EP Device is used to deliver TAVO™ into cells in tumor lesions, with the aim of reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the treated tumor and eliciting systemic tumor-specific immune responses in cancer patients. Activation of an appropriate anti-tumor inflammatory response in the treated lesion can drive the immune system to mount a systemic anti-tumor response against untreated tumors in other parts of the body. In 2017, we received Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for TAVO™ in metastatic melanoma, which could qualify TAVO™-EP for expedited FDA review, a rolling Biologics License Application (“BLA”) review and certain other benefits to achieve faster registration of a therapeutic product.
Development Programs
 
Our current focus is to continue development of TAVO™-EP in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in melanoma.
 
Our KEYNOTE-695 clinical trial, testing TAVO™-EP in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), is a registration-directed, Phase 2b open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial in approximately 100 patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic melanoma after treatment with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. In May 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) in connection with the KEYNOTE-695 clinical trial. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, each company will bear its own costs related to manufacturing and supply of its product, as well as be responsible for its own internal costs. OncoSec is the sponsor of the KEYNOTE-695 trial and we are responsible for external costs. The KEYNOTE-695 trial completed enrollment of the primary cohort (105 patients) in December 2020. In December 2020, the protocol was amended to include an additional cohort, consisting of patients who were exposed to treatment with ipilimumab and progressed on prior anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. The amendment also enabled enrollment of approximately 25 additional patients to be treated with an updated version of the OMS EP Device (i.e., GenPulseTM generator and Series 3 Applicator). Database lock for the 105 patients enrolled in Cohort 1 is November 2022 and the final data analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.
 
In August 2020, we supported commencement of an investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial (Phase 2 IIT) conducted by the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine to evaluate TAVO™-EP as neoadjuvant treatment (administered before surgery) in combination with intravenous OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in up to 33 patients with operable locally/regionally advanced melanoma. This Phase 2 IIT has been designed to evaluate whether the addition of TAVO™-EP can increase the published anti-tumor response observed with monotherapy OPDIVO®, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with locally/regionally advanced melanoma prior to surgical resection of tumors. This Phase 2 IIT began enrolling patients in December of 2020. Enrollment for this trial is expected to be completed in 2023. Preliminary data from this Phase 2 IIT will be presented at an international medical conference, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), in 2022.
 
In May 2018, we entered into a second clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck with respect to a KEYNOTE-890, Phase 2 trial of TAVO™-EP in combination with KEYTRUDA®. In Cohort 1 of this trial we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), who have previously failed at least one systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, both companies will bear their own costs related to manufacturing and supply of their product, as well as be responsible for their own internal costs. OncoSec is the sponsor of the KEYNOTE-890 trial and responsible for external costs. Enrollment of Cohort 1 was completed (26 patients) in December 2020. Interim data for Cohort 1 was initially presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”) in December 2019; an update on this cohort was presented at the SABCS in December 2021. In June 2020, we amended our second clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement to include KEYNOTE-890, Cohort 2, for the frontline treatment of patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC with the combination of TAVO-EP, KEYTRUDA, and chemotherapy. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (target 40 patients) began in January 2021. Due to slow enrollment and competing trials by other sponsors in front-line TNBC, recruitment on KEYNOTE-890 Cohort 2 has been halted as of October 2022.

In May 2019, we supported commencement of an investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial (Phase 1 IIT) conducted by the University of California San Francisco (“UCSF”) Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. This Phase 1 IIT enrolls patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head & Neck and is a single-arm open-label clinical trial in which 68 evaluable patients will receive TAVO™-EP, KEYTRUDA® and epacadostat. Recruitment on this Phase 1 IIT was halted for strategic reasons in June 2021.
 
Technology Platform
 
Our ImmunoPulse® platform is based on the concept of delivering macromolecules, including but not necessarily limited to plasmid DNA, into cells for local expression and activity via electroporation by an electric field that is generated by our OMS EP Device. The clinical lead molecule TAVO™ is a plasmid encoding human IL-12. Our most advanced device is the GenPulse 2.0 with our Series 3 Applicator. Clinical trials with TAVO™-EP have been conducted with predecessor OMS EP Devices. While seeking regulatory approval of GenPulse 2.0, we are also exploring other device strategies for use in future programs. We are developing our next-generation EP device and applicator, including advancements toward prototypes, and intend to pursue discovery research to identify other product candidates that, similar to IL-12, can be encoded into plasmid-DNA and delivered, using our proprietary delivery and application method, intratumorally using EP once our financial position allows such expanded discovery research. For example, we intend to develop proprietary technology to potentially treat liver, lung, bladder, pancreatic and other difficult to treat visceral lesions through the direct delivery of plasmid encoded therapeutics with the Visceral Lesion Applicator (“VLA”). We also intend to continue to pursue potential new trials and studies related to TAVO™, in various tumor types.
 
In November 2020, we obtained an exclusive license to the Cliniporator® electroporation gene electrotransfer platform from IGEA Clinical Biophysics. This platform has been used for electrochemotherapy in and outside of Europe in over 200 major oncological centers to treat cutaneous metastatic cancer nodules, including melanoma. The license encompasses a broad field of use for gene delivery in oncology, including use for our VLA development efforts.
 
The VLA is intended and may be designed to work with low voltage EP generators, including but not limited to Cliniporator® and our proprietary APOLLOTM EP generator, and is expected to enable transfection of immunologically relevant genes into cells located in visceral primary or metastatic tumor lesions. In early 2020, we presented preclinical data pertaining to visceral delivery of plasmid-based therapeutics as two poster presentations, one at the Society for Interventional Oncology and one at the Society for Interventional Radiology. Additionally, we have successfully completed several animal studies to test the VLA and improve its design. We expect to bring a VLA into the clinic in 2023. However, this timeline is under evaluation and may extend. We believe that the flexibility of our proprietary plasmid-DNA technology may allow the Company to deliver other immunologically relevant molecules into the tumor microenvironment in addition to the delivery of TAVO™.

Cancer Immunotherapy Treatments: Background
 
Many traditional modalities for treating cancer, such as chemotherapy, provide limited survival benefits and are frequently associated with significant side effects. Immunotherapy, which has received significant attention in recent years, focuses on modulating the immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Systemic delivery of cytokines that regulate the immune system, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), or interleukin-12 (IL-12), has shown indications of efficacy but also mechanism-based toxicity.
 
The development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, which target and block critical “immune checkpoint” proteins such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), program cell-death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), has been successful at augmenting anti-tumor immunity with more easily controlled toxicity than systemic cytokines. To date, several agents have been approved for the treatment of multiple cancers, e.g., anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, Keytruda®). Although these new immuno-oncology agents have shown clinical benefits for patients with solid tumors across multiple cancer types, a majority of patients do not respond (primary refractory) or will eventually relapse. One hypothesis for lack of efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in primary refractory patients is that the tumor lacks a sufficient immune milieu, i.e., is deficient of infiltrating immune cells (immune desert) or infiltrating immune cells have impaired anti-tumor effector function (exhausted, immune excluded). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches that can alter the tumor immune environment directly are an area of intense research.
 
The TAVO™ EP therapeutic approach was developed to allow safe delivery of a powerful and well characterized cytokine, IL-12, encoded on a plasmid into cells in the tumor microenvironment and, thereby, achieving local expression. Local IL-12 expression curtails systemic toxicity and achieves activation of immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment, which ultimately can result in systemic immune surveillance.
 
RECENT DEVLOPMENTS
 
Restructuring Plan
 
As previously disclosed, on October 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) that is designed to prioritize clinical activities in melanoma to reduce operating expenses while advancing our lead product candidate, TAVO™ EP, toward near-term data milestones in connection with the KEYNOTE-695 clinical trial. As part of the Restructuring Plan, we restructured our internal operations and reduced our workforce by approximately 45%, or approximately 18 employees.
 
We currently estimate that we will incur charges of approximately $750,000 to $800,000 in connection with the Restructuring Plan, consisting primarily of cash expenditures for employee transition, notice period and severance payments, retention bonus payments, and related costs as well as non-cash expenses related to vesting of share-based awards. We expect that the majority of the restructuring charges will be incurred in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 and first calendar quarter of 2023, and that the execution of the Restructuring Plan will be substantially complete by the second calendar quarter of 2023.
 
The charges that we expect to incur in connection with the Restructuring Plan are estimates and subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially. The foregoing estimated amounts do not include any non-cash charges associated with stock-based compensation. We expect to operationalize additional cost reduction actions that will include other incremental cost reduction actions unrelated to workforce reductions.
 
Nasdaq Compliance
 
As previously disclosed, on June 2, 2022, we received notice (the “Notice”) from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, which continues to trade at this time on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ONCS.”

-

 

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days, or until November 29, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by November 29, 2022, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares ($1 million) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price, and provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In that event, we may appeal such delisting determination to a hearings panel.
 
We continue to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and are considering options to resolve our noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement, including by conducting a reverse stock split.
 
COVID-19
 
Our operational and financial performance have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our clinical trials have experienced delays in patient enrollment, potentially due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a public health emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic is also affecting the operations of government entities, such as the FDA, as well as contract research organizations, third-party manufacturers, and other third-parties upon whom we rely. The extent of the impact on our operations cannot be ascertained at this time.
 
CLINICAL PROGRAMS
 
Our Lead Product Candidate: TAVO™
 
TAVO™-EP is a drug-device combination. The therapeutic modality consists of a DNA plasmid called tavokinogene telseplasmid (TAVO™) that encodes the potent immune-stimulatory cytokine IL-12. TAVO™ is injected directly into tumor lesions and, using our proprietary OMS EP Device, transfected into local cells. Our clinical data indicates that the in vivo gene transfer of plasmid DNA-encoded IL-12 using EP is well-tolerated. Anti-tumor activity has been observed as early as after a single cycle of treatment. Importantly, regression in distant, non-injected/non-electroporated lesions has also been observed (“abscopal effect”) in different solid cancers.
OUR CLINICAL PIPELINE
 
Melanoma
 
Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer with rapidly rising incidences both in the U.S. and globally. The National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (“SEER”) Program estimates that 96,480 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2019, representing 5.5% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. Overall, the five-year survival rate for melanoma, regardless of disease stage, is high (92.2%); however, according to SEER 2019, for patients who present with metastatic disease and receive systemic treatment, the five-year survival rate is considerably lower at less than 25%. Despite recent advances in therapy, advanced metastatic melanoma continues to present a major and increasing burden with significant morbidity and mortality.
 
KEYNOTE-695 Study (ongoing)
 
The KEYNOTE-695 clinical trial is a Phase 2b, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial of TAVO™ EP in combination with an intravenous anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck’s KEYTRUDA®, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma and confirmed progression on immediate prior anti-PD-1 therapy. The KEYNOTE-695 trial completed enrollment of the original cohort (105 patients) in December of 2020; approximately half of the cohort was enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic.

KEYNOTE-695 enrollment criteria with respect to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor failure is highly restrictive. In order to be considered an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor failure, all patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable melanoma (Stage III or IV) with progressive locally advanced or metastatic diseases, be refractory/relapsed to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, namely KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) or OPDIVO® (nivolumab), as either monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies according to their approved label. Patients must have relapsed as documented by confirmed disease progression within 12 weeks of the last dose of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody administration. Patients can have no intervening therapies between failure of anti-PD-1 therapy and the TAVO™ / KEYTRUDA® combination treatment with the exception of approved BRAF (proto-oncogene B-Raf)/MEK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitor combinations. Patients that are BRAF/MEK inhibitor eligible may have received BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the objective response rate (“ORR”) based on RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Database lock for the 105 patients enrolled in Cohort 1 is November 2022 and the final data analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively.
 
KEYNOTE-695 is a registration-directed clinical trial. In order to be eligible for accelerated approval, the TAVO™-EP / KEYTRUDA® combination must treat a serious condition and provide a meaningful advantage over available therapies. Prior to the commencement of the trial, we reviewed the patient inclusion and progression criteria, and other trial requirements with FDA. In light of this review, we strictly defined the patient population to be enrolled in KEYNOTE-695 to include only those patients who have definitively progressed on prior anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy.
 
In July 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck with respect to a Phase 3 study of TAVOTM in combination with KEYTRUDA® to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with Stage III or IV unresectable, metastatic melanoma, and who are refractory to prior checkpoint therapy. This study is referred to as KEYNOTE-C87. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, both companies will bear their own costs related to manufacturing and supply of their product, as well as be responsible for their own internal costs. We are the study sponsor and are responsible for external costs. The trial is designed to be a global Phase 3 randomized clinical trial and is intended to support accelerated approval by the U.S. FDA and/or serve as a pivotal study to support a full licensure.


OMS-102 (completed)
 
OMS-102 was an open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 trial of TAVO™-EP and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma. In August 2015, we enrolled the first patient in our Phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trial led by the clinicians at UCSF. Huntsman Cancer Institute in Utah was the second clinical site. The primary endpoint of this trial was to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of TAVO™-EP and KEYTRUDA® in patients with stage III/IV metastatic melanoma whose tumors are characterized by low frequency of CD8+/PD-1+/CTLA-4+ TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes). The primary endpoint of the study was best overall response rate by RECIST of the combination regimen. Recent data suggests that patients whose tumors are lacking TILs or CD8+ T-cells at the tumor margin or generally have a low frequency of CD8+/PD-L1+/CTLA-4+ TILs are unlikely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapies such as KEYTRUDA®, while tumors with a frequency of CTLA-4+/PD-L1+/CD8+ T-cells >20% in the tumor are likely to have a clinical benefit. Therapies, such as TAVO™, that promote TIL generation and PD-L1 positivity play an important role in potentially augmenting the clinical efficacy of the anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents.
 
Initial data of the OMS-102 trial were presented in February 2017 at ASCO-SITC and the trial stopped enrolling patients in September 2017, allowing us to progress on to the KEYNOTE-695 trial. The study was selected for an oral presentation at SITC 2017, and the final data were published in Clinical Cancer Research in May 2020. The overall response rate in 22 evaluated patients was 41%, with 36% complete responses. These results suggest that the combination of TAVO and KEYTRUDA has efficacy in this low TIL metastatic melanoma patient population. Furthermore, the combination therapy was well tolerated. Data from this trial was published in Clinical Cancer Research in May 2020.
 
OMS-100 (completed)
 
OMS-100 was an open-label Phase 2 trial of TAVO™-EP monotherapy in patients with stage III/IV metastatic melanoma. The study was selected for an oral presentation at the Melanoma Bridge Conference in 2018, and final data from this trial were published in the Annals of Oncology in March 2020. Among 28 evaluable patients treated with up to 4 cycles of TAVO-EP on days 1, 5 and 8 of each 12-week cycle, the response rate was 35.7%, and among all evaluable patients, including those treated on alternative dosing schedules, the response rate was 29.8%. The results of this study demonstrated that multiple treatment cycles of TAVO™ were well tolerated, with no treatment-limiting toxicities. The majority of adverse events were localized to the treatment site and Grade-1 or -2 in severity.

Following this trial, a retrospective analysis of the patients who went on to receive an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was conducted. Results from this retrospective analysis suggested that TAVO™ primes and enhances response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Specifically, of the 29 patients who completed TAVO™ treatment, 14 subsequently received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Overall, five of these 14 patients (36%) experienced a complete response and four patients experienced a partial response (29%), for an overall response rate of 65% (75% without intervening therapies). Two patients experienced stable disease (14%) and three patients experienced progressive disease (21%). We believe this retrospective sequential data could suggest combinatorial potential of an immune-priming effect with TAVO™ prior to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Data from this retrospective analysis formed the clinical rationale for conducting OMS-102.
 
Phase 2 Investigator-Initiated Melanoma Neoadjuvant Trial 
 
In August 2020, we supported commencement of an investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial conducted by the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine to evaluate TAVO™ as neoadjuvant treatment (administered before surgery) in combination with intravenous OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in up to 33 patients with operable locally/regionally advanced melanoma. This trial has been designed to evaluate whether the addition of TAVO™ can increase the published anti-tumor response observed with monotherapy OPDIVO®, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with locally/regionally advanced melanoma prior to surgical resection of tumors. This trial began enrolling patients in December 2020. Using a Simon’s 2-stage design the trial has met the pre-specified efficacy criteria to pass Stage 1 and has proceeded enrollment on to Stage 2 in up to 33 patients. Enrollment for this trial is expected to be completed in 2023. Preliminary data from this trial will be presented at an international medical conference, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting, in November 2022.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
 
Breast cancer was the most common cancer diagnosed among U.S. women and was the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 2021. Worldwide, approximately 170,000 new cases of TNBC are diagnosed each year, with TNBC representing one of the four main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer, accounting for approximately 10-20% of all breast cancer, according to breastcancer.org. According to the American Cancer Society, for patients who present with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, the five-year survival rate is considerably lower at approximately 22%.
 
TNBC frequently affects younger women (under 40 years old) and is characterized by higher relapse rates than estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. TNBC is also associated with an increased risk of recurrence, both locally and in distant sites including the lungs and brain. Advanced TNBC remains a significant area of unmet medical need. Chemotherapy is the current standard-of-care treatment in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and metastatic settings. Due to the loss of hormone receptors on the tumor cell, patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal therapy or treatments targeting the oncogenic HER2 pathway. The standard of care for TNBC patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease is cytotoxic chemotherapy, leading to a median survival of approximately 13 months from the time of recurrence or diagnosis of distant metastases. 
 
During October of 2022, we decreased all clinical activity outside of our melanoma clinical pipeline, including trials and studies involving TNBC.

KEYNOTE-890 study (halted)
 
KEYNOTE-890 is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial of TAVO™-EP in combination with an intravenous anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck’s pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), in patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received at least one prior line of approved systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Cohort 1 of this study was enrolling patients who had experienced at least one prior treatment option including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Cohort 2 was enrolling treatment-naïve patients in front-line TNBC with the study treatment regimen of TAVO™-EP in combination with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy.
 
KEYNOTE-890, Cohort 1 completed enrollment in early 2020. Enrollment in Cohort 2 began in the first quarter of 2021. Interim data for Cohort 1 was initially presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”) in December 2019, and an update on this cohort was presented at the SABCS in December 2021. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (target 40 patients) began in January 2021. Due to slow enrollment and competing studies in front-line TNBC, recruitment on Cohort 2 has been halted as of October 2022. We have deferred further development of TAVO™ for the treatment of TNBC in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of TAVO™ in melanoma.
 
OMS-140 (enrollment completed)
 
OMS-140 is a Phase 2, monotherapy trial in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC. The trial was conducted at Stanford University and was designed to assess safety and efficacy of TAVO™ by evaluating whether TAVO™ promotes tumor immunogenicity by driving a pro-inflammatory cascade that leads to increases in cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (“TILs”). The presence and number of TILs is thought to be a key requirement for promoting the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1. By driving cytotoxic immune cells into the tumor, TAVO™ could be used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies, which have reported some, but limited, activity in TNBC.
 
The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the potential of TAVO™ to promote a pro-inflammatory molecular and histological signature, and the secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety and tolerability, evaluation of local ablation effect (% of necrosis), and description of other evidence of anti-tumor activity. The trial was subsequently amended to also capture the post-TAVO™ treatments and outcomes.
 
Preliminary data was presented at the SABCS annual meeting in 2018 and enrollment in this trial (n=10) is now complete. The clinical observations from this study prompted us to conduct KEYNOTE-890.
 
Duke University
 
We have an ongoing research collaboration with Duke University’s Center for Applied Therapeutics (“Duke University”) to evaluate TAVO™ in combination or sequenced with a HER2-plasmid vaccine administered with our APOLLO™ EP generator in preclinical studies. The research is led by Herbert Kim Lyerly, M.D., George Barth Geller Professor, Professor of Immunology, Surgery and Pathology at Duke University School of Medicine and a director on our board of directors. This work, showing that intratumoral plasmid IL12 expands CD8+ T cells and induces a CXCR3 gene signature (CXCR3-GS) in tumors that sensitizes TNBC patients to anti-PD-1 therapy, was recently reported in a peer reviewed journal.
 
In this study, Duke investigators used mouse models of TNBC, to evaluate immune activation in response to administration of intratumoral IL-12 plasmid followed by electroporation (tavokinogene telseplasmid; TAVO™). Collaborators at Stanford further presented a single-arm, prospective clinical trial of TAVO™-EP monotherapy in patients with treatment refractory, advanced TNBC (OMS-140). Single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse tumors identified a CXCR3-GS following TAVO™-EP treatment associated with enhanced antigen presentation, T cell infiltration and expansion, and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Assessment of tissue from patients before and after treatment confirmed the enrichment of this CXCR3-GS in tumors from patients with enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration following treatment. One patient, previously unresponsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy, but who exhibited an increased CXCR3-GS after TAVO™ treatment, went on to receive additional anti-PD-1 therapy as their immediate next treatment after OMS-140, and demonstrated a significant clinical response. These data suggest that a safe, effective intratumoral IL-12 therapy can enhance antigen presentation and CD8 T cell recruitment, which contribute to the antitumor efficacy. They identify a TAVO™-EP treatment-related gene signature associated with improved outcomes and conversion of nonresponsive tumors, potentially even beyond TNBC.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head & Neck Cancer (SCCHN)
 
Head and neck cancer represent approximately 4% of all cancers in the U.S., and it is estimated over 65,000 patients will develop head and neck cancer this year with over 14,000 deaths.
 
During October of 2022, we decreased all clinical activity outside of our melanoma clinical pipeline, including trials and studies involving SCCHN.
 
OMS-131 (closed)
 
OMS-131 is an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. OMS-131, also referred to as the “TRIFECTA” trial, was initiated after clinical observations from a 2017 pilot study of TAVO™ in head and neck cancer patients demonstrated clinical and biological results including evidence of synergy between TAVO™ and PD-1 antibodies in the disease. Recruitment for this study was halted for strategic reasons in June 2021. We have deferred further development of TAVO™-EP for the treatment of head and neck cancer in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of TAVO™-EP in melanoma.
 
Our OMS Electroporation Device
 
The effectiveness of DNA-based therapeutics is dependent upon their uptake into cells by crossing the cell membrane. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the brief application of high-intensity, pulsed electric fields to cells resulted in a temporary and reversible increase in the permeability of the cell membrane, a mechanism known as EP.
 
The transient, reversible nature of the permeabilization of cell membranes by electroporation (EP) and the resulting increase in intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents is the underlying basis of our therapeutic approach. Our EP delivery system consists of an electrical pulse generator paired with disposable applicators facilitating electroporation. The extent of membrane permeabilization depends on various electrical, physical, chemical, and biological parameters, but EP delivery has been demonstrated to promote cellular uptake of chemical molecules such as chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., bleomycin and cisplatin), and other therapeutic agents including nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).
 
Multiple viral and non-viral delivery modalities have been developed to deliver nucleic acids into cells, however, many of these methods have faced challenges related to the safe and efficient expression of the DNA-encoded biologic into the intended target cells. For example, viral mediated delivery technologies appear to be efficient at transfecting cells, but they have suffered from significant safety issues related to the immunogenicity of the viral vector, shedding of the virus, and potential integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. Other non-viral delivery methods have employed the use of nanotechnology to coat the DNA with lipids. Although these lipid nanoparticle technologies have been used extensively in the clinic to deliver DNA-encoded biologic agents, few particles have been developed with the ability to specifically target cancer cells; instead, many of these particles naturally target the liver, which can function as a sink for the therapeutic agent or lead to potential liver toxicities.
 
EP has also been used extensively in the clinic to deliver DNA and other therapeutic agents. EP has not shown the same safety concerns that limit the use of other drug delivery modalities. In fact, the use of EP to deliver bleomycin intratumorally has been approved for use in Europe and is being used for cancers such as basal cell carcinoma across many European countries, including the United Kingdom.
 
Our OMS EP Device is designed to create favorable conditions to deliver plasmid DNA encoding immunotherapeutic cytokines into cells of the tumor microenvironment. The cytokine-encoding plasmid is injected directly into tumor lesions and taken up by cells after local exposure to electric pulses produced by the pulse generator and the needle-electrode.

Our lead product candidate, TAVO™, consists of a plasmid construct encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 that is injected into the tumor and delivered into the tumor cells through in vivo electroporation using our OMS EP Device. Once our financial position allows such expanded research efforts, we may also continue researching other DNA-encoded, immunologically-active molecules, with an aim of developing additional immunotherapeutic drugs that, when delivered using our OMS EP Device, may be capable of breaking the immune system’s tolerance to cancer.
 
Visceral Lesion Applicator (VLA)
 
Ongoing efforts aim to develop our next-generation intratumoral delivery device and applicators. We have made advancements toward prototypes, pursuing discovery research to identify other product candidates that, in addition to IL-12, can be encoded into propriety plasmid-DNA, delivered intratumorally. While our current focus is on melanoma, we may continue developing a new, propriety technology to potentially treat liver, lung, bladder, pancreatic and other difficult to treat visceral lesions through the direct delivery of plasmid-based therapeutics, such as IL-12, with a new VLA once our financial position allows us to do so.
 
The VLA is intended and may be designed to work with low voltage EP generators. We have successfully completed several pre-clinical animal studies and presented data in posters at the 2020 Society for Interventional Oncology meeting, where it was awarded “Best Technology Scientific Abstract”, and the 2020 Society for Interventional Radiology meeting. The Company expected to bring a VLA into the clinic in 2023. However, this timeline is under evaluation and may extend beyond 2023. Moving forward, we see significant opportunity to leverage this innovative technology to secure new partnerships that may allow us to expand our capabilities, help cancer patients with unmet clinical needs, and drive shareholder value.
 
COMMERCIALIZATION
 
Strategy
 
Our primary focus is to pursue our study of TAVO™-EP in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in melanoma, including our planned and ongoing clinical trials discussed under “Clinical Programs” above and potentially other trials we may pursue in the future.
 
As a part of our commercialization strategy, we also regularly assess and evaluate potential collaboration opportunities to identify novel therapeutic modalities for EP delivery as well as rational combinations for TAVO™-EP with existing and emerging cancer therapeutics, e.g., monoclonal antibody therapies and other large and small molecule drugs. For instance, we may seek to collaborate with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to provide us with access to complementary proprietary technologies and/or greater resources. In addition, we may seek to expand the applications of our technologies through strategic collaborations or other opportunities, such as in-licensing or strategic acquisitions, and we may seek to out-license our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that we may not choose to internally and independently develop.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
Currently, we assemble and store certain components of our OMS EP Device system, which is our proprietary delivery mechanism for our TAVO™ product candidate, and we utilize the services of qualified contract manufacturers to produce the remaining components of this system and for the manufacturing, testing, packaging and storage of our plasmid product candidate for clinical trials or other studies. Manufacturing of our systems and product supplies requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the use of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Currently, we do not own and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities for any device, drug substance or drug product. We expect to increase our reliance on third-party manufacturers but may also consider alternative manufacturing strategies.
 
We rely upon a small number of suppliers and manufacturers for our clinical activities. For manufacturing and distributing we use external parties, which collectively account for approximately 90% of clinical materials and EP systems support and materials. We believe there are alternate sources of raw material supply and finished goods manufacturing to satisfy our requirements, although transitioning to other vendors, if necessary, could result in delay or additional costs. In addition, for combination trials, we typically rely exclusively on one supplier of the non-company-owned product used in the trial, such as our reliance upon Merck for the supply of KEYTRUDA® in the KEYNOTE-695 and KEYNOTE-890 studies.
 
We are ISO 13485:2016 certified and comply with all appropriate standards and authorities for the assembly, manufacturing and activities we conduct, and we have established an audited quality management system for these activities. In addition, all contract manufacturers that we use must comply with various requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection programs. See “Regulation” below for more information.

COMPETITION
 
The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. This competitive environment stimulates an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation and necessitates effective and targeted marketing strategies to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and payors in managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and Medicare and Medicaid services.
 
We face competition from a number of sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. We compete against other developers of cancer treatments, including immunotherapy treatments as well as other types of treatments for cancer indications on which we are focused. In particular, a number of companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, have development strategies similar to our current focus. These companies could include, among others, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Iovance Therapeutics, Syndax, Dynavax Technologies, Checkmate, Immunomedics and Idera Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we also compete with other clinical-stage biotechnology companies for funding and support from healthcare and other investors and potential collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical or other companies, as well as for personnel with expertise in our industry. We are smaller and less well-funded than many of our competitors, and we have a shorter and less proven operating history and a less recognizable and established brand name than many of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have commercially available products, which provide them with operating revenue and other competitive advantages.
 
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates more rapidly than we can or may obtain more robust patent protection or other intellectual property rights to protect their product candidates and technologies, which could limit or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates, we will face competition from approved products or products under development by other companies that may address our targeted indications. If we directly compete with large entities for the same markets and/or customers, their greater resources, brand recognition, sales and marketing experience and financial strength could prevent us from capturing a share of these markets or customers. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed, less costly or more widely accepted for other reasons than any of our products that obtain regulatory approvals, and our competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing, distributing and otherwise marketing their products.
 
We expect our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. We may not be able to effectively compete in any of these areas. Presently, we compete with other biotechnology companies for funding and support on the basis of our technology platforms and the potential value of our product candidates based on the factors described above.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We believe our success and ability to compete depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technologies, including obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates and their respective components and underlying technologies, including devices, formulations, manufacturing methods and methods of treatment, and appropriately safeguarding unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how. Our core technology, ImmunoPulse®, is designed to enable transient expression of recombinant therapeutic molecules in cells, and is a drug-device therapeutic modality platform comprised of our proprietary OMS EP Device and proprietary DNA plasmid delivery and application methods, protected through a combination of Company-owned and in-licensed patents as well as through various trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary rights.


As of October 2022, we owned 74 issued patents (6 U.S. and 68 foreign) and 93 pending patent applications (14 U.S. and 79 foreign). We are currently prosecuting pending patent applications in various jurisdictions. We have issued patents in the U.S., Europe, Hong Kong and Japan with claims directed to cytokine-based intratumoral immunotherapies in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. These patents expire in 2036. U.S. Patent 11,318,305, with claims directed to electroporation systems and devices having adaptive control features, was issued on May 3, 2022, and is expected to expire in 2037. Japanese Patent 7079729, directed to our next generation IL-12 expression vector was issued on May 25, 2022, and expires in 2036. In addition, we have licensed intellectual property rights that allow us to use certain EP technology to deliver DNA-based cytokines as an immunotherapy, as well as catheter-based delivery devices. From these in-licensed portfolios, we have access to 91 issued U.S. and foreign issued patents (7 from USF, 26 from Gaeta Therapeutics, and 58 from Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Inovio)) and 13 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications (1 from USF, 3 from Gaeta Therapeutics, and 9 from Inovio). We expect to continue to file additional patent applications, if and when appropriate, as our research and development efforts continue. The majority of the patents in our portfolio, including owned and in-licensed patents and fundamental patents directed toward our proprietary technology, expire between 2023 and 2041. We have previously obtained patent protection through an asset purchase agreement with Inovio covering our original clinical electroporation device. The primary patents providing protection of this original device have expired. However, the Company has recently filed applications, in 2019-2021, on our next generation electroporation devices and applicator handles and our next generation DNA-based cancer immunotherapeutics and will continue to file patent applications this year.
 
In addition, we have entered into a cross-license agreement for certain electroporation technology with Inovio, including patent protection for some of our clinical electroporation devices (some of which, as noted above, have recently expired or will soon expire). Under the terms of the agreement, Inovio has granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain of its electroporation patents, and in exchange, we have granted to Inovio an exclusive license to certain of our purchased technology in a limited field of use.
 
REGULATION
 
Commercialization Approval for our Product Candidates
 
Biotechnology companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation relating to the ability to market and sell any therapeutic or medical device. In the United States, these regulations are principally enforced by the FDA and state government agencies. Outside the United States, these regulations are typically administered by various health authorities comparable to the FDA in countries where products or product candidates are researched, tested, manufactured and/or marketed.
United States
 
General
 
In the United States, the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, other state statutes and regulations, many of which are administered and enforced by the FDA, govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, verification, validation, clinical testing, manufacturing, storage, record-keeping, approval, labeling, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, import and export of product candidates such as ours. Under these regulations, we and our contract manufacturers may be subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, quality controls and other procedures, and operations and/or the testing of our product candidates during and after the approval process for a product candidate, to confirm compliance with all applicable regulations, including current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) and other applicable requirements.
 
Possible penalties or other consequences for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements include, among others, observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could force us to modify our clinical programs or other activities; clinical holds on our ongoing clinical programs; adverse publicity from the FDA or others; the FDA’s suspension of its review of pending applications; fines; product recalls or seizures; total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution; labeling changes; withdrawal of previously granted product approvals; enforcement actions; injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Approval Process
 
Before any new drug, device or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or biologic, can be marketed in the United States, FDA approval is required. The process required by the FDA before a product may be marketed in the United States generally involves, among other things:

● | completion of non-clinical testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | completion of chemistry, manufacturing, and control testing, commonly known as CMC; 
● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must be accepted and effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | performance of adequate human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each intended use; 
● | for a stand-alone medical device, submission to the FDA of a premarket approval application (“PMA”) or 510(k) premarket notification, which the FDA must review and approve; and 
● | for a therapeutic, submission to the FDA of a NDA or BLA which the FDA must review and approve. 

 
The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The receipt and timing of approval, if any, is uncertain. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with certain manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Once an IND is in effect, the protocol for each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drugs or biologics to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice requirements. For purposes of a NDA or BLA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its safety, tolerability and effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted. 
● | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety and to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. 
● | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. 

 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. NDAs or BLAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things.
 

18
--

 

Once the NDA or BLA submission has been accepted, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Pursuant to the FDA’s performance goals, NDA and BLA standard reviews are to be completed within 10 months, subject to extensions by the FDA. Before approving a NDA or BLA, the FDA often inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with good manufacturing practices. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with good clinical practices before approving a NDA or BLA. If the FDA determines that a NDA or BLA is not approvable, then the FDA may outline the deficiencies and often will request that additional information be provided or additional clinical trials be completed. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
Further, even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, such approval would specify the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Additionally, we would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA with respect to any approved product, including requirements related to, among other things, drug or device listing, record-keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion, and reporting of adverse events associated with any approved products. Moreover, we could be required to conduct post-approval studies, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, or surveillance programs to monitor the safety of any approved products. FDA has the authority to stop or limit further marketing of a product or impose more stringent labeling restrictions based on the results of these post-approval programs or in the event of any unexpected or serious health or safety concern regarding any approved product.
 
Non-U.S. Regulation
 
If we pursue research and/or commercialization activities for our product candidates outside the United States, we would need to obtain necessary approvals from the regulatory authorities comparable to the FDA in applicable jurisdictions before we could commence clinical trials or marketing of our product candidates in these jurisdictions. In addition, we would become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy of our product candidates and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial activities, manufacture and distribution of our product candidates. The requirements to obtain product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the FDA’s approval requirements, review procedures and timelines may not be the same as or even similar to the requirements or a comparable foreign regulator. As a result, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in one country, we may be required to undertake additional clinical trials or studies, submit additional information, wait for longer review periods or make other efforts in order to obtain regulatory approvals in other desirable geographic markets.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, constantly evolving and subject to significant change and fluctuation. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that currently impact our business include, among others:

● | the laws and regulations administered and enforced by the FDA, including the FDCA, and other federal statutes and regulations, discussed above; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, which, in general and among other things, expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority, including requiring pharmaceutical companies to record and disclose to government agencies any transfers of value to doctors and teaching hospitals, and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to the federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute to make it easier to bring suits under these statutes; 
● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 


19
--


● | the federal false claims laws, which generally prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which, in general and among other things, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and impose requirements for the use of standardized electronic transactions with respect to transmission of such information; and 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by applicable federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
Additionally, the healthcare compliance environment is continuously changing at the federal level and with some states mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, spending limits and reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Further, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign countries, such as our clinical activities in Australia, or in Canada, or if we seek to sell any product that obtains regulatory approval in a foreign country, we would be subject to different reporting and other compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions, including foreign laws and regulations comparable to the U.S. laws and regulations described above.
 
All of these laws impose penalties for non-compliance, some of which may be severe. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or other monetary damages or orders forcing us to curtail or restructure our operations.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements and Environmental Matters
 
We are or may become subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals, as well as environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
In addition, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to anti-bribery laws in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and comparable foreign laws. Further, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to other matters, including workplace health and safety, labor and employment, public reporting and taxation, among others, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties or imposition of sanctions or other corrective requirements.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Our senior management team and Board of Directors have decades of experience, each demonstrating a strong track record of success in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in research and development, commercialization and financing activities. In addition, we have assembled a clinical and regulatory team experienced in developing and advancing novel therapeutic approaches through clinical testing and regulatory approvals, including extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee our clinical, manufacturing and testing activities. Our team consists of a relatively small number of employees, as well as consultants and advisors regarding research and development, regulatory, compliance, healthcare and investor and public relations matters. We also expect to engage experts in healthcare and in general business to advise us in various capacities. For instance, we have in the past consulted with various oncology researchers and clinicians to provide counsel as part of our advisory panels for our clinical programs, and we expect to continue to establish consulting and advisory relationships with scientific, clinical and medical experts in academia and industry to assist us with FDA submissions, clinical testing and identification and development of new product candidates.
