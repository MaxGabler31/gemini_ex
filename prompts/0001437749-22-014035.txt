--------+---------

Overview
 
American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on April 9, 1987. We are a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that Orchestrate the Rhythm and Harmony of Power on the Grid™, and protect and expand the capability of the Navy’s fleet. Our system level products leverage the Company’s proprietary “smart materials” and “smart software and controls” to provide enhanced resiliency and improved performance of megawatt-scale power flow.
 
In the power grid market, we enable electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute smarter, cleaner and better power through our power electronics and superconductor-based systems as well as our transmission planning services. We protect and expand the capability of the U.S. Navy surface fleet with advanced superconductor-based systems which provide superior performance advantages to the traditional methods of mine field protection. In the wind power market, we enable manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics and control system products, engineering, and support services. Our power grid and wind products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency, and affordability to our customers.
 
Our power system solutions help to improve energy efficiency, alleviate power capacity and other constraints, improve system resiliency, and increase the adoption of renewable energy generation. Demand for our solutions is driven by: the growing needs for modernized grids that improve power reliability, security, and quality, the U.S. Navy’s effort to upgrade in-board power systems to support fleet electrification, and the need for increased renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar energy. Concerns about these factors have led to increased spending by corporations and the military, as well as supportive government regulations and initiatives on local, state and national levels, including renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives, and international treaties.
 
On October 1, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the selling stockholders named therein.  Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding (i) shares of capital stock of Northeast Power Systems, Inc., a New York corporation (“NEPSI”), and (ii) membership interests of Northeast Power Realty, LLC, a New York limited liability company, which holds the real property that serves as NEPSI’s headquarters (the “NEPSI Acquisition”). NEPSI is a U.S.-based global provider of medium-voltage metal-enclosed power capacitor banks and harmonic filter banks for use on electric power systems.  As a result of this transaction, NEPSI became a wholly-owned subsidiary and is operated by our Grid business segment.
 
On May 6, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Neeltran Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the selling stockholders named therein.  Pursuant to the terms of the Neeltran Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding (i) shares of capital stock of Neeltran, Inc., a Connecticut corporation (“Neeltran”) and (ii) Neeltran International, Inc., a Connecticut corporation (“International”). Neeltran, Inc., is a U.S. based corporation that supplies rectifiers and transformers to industrial customers.  As a result of this transaction, Neeltran became a wholly-owned subsidiary and is operated by our Grid business segment.
 
Market opportunities
 
We provide solutions that address three key drivers of our business:
 

• | the evolving electric grid;
--+----------------------------

--+----------------------------------------

 
Our power system products address five market opportunities (areas):
 

• | Transmission grid. We provide complete systems that enable electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect and transmit power with exceptional efficiency, reliability, security and affordability. We provide planning services that allow us to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks, which help us determine how our solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of our grid interconnection solutions and power quality systems for wind farms and solar power plants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Distribution grid. We provide a direct-connect power quality system that is installed on the primary distribution network in communities, business parks, or wherever enhanced power quality is beneficial and is designed to increase the reliability and resiliency of the distribution grid to serve the needs of modern energy consumers.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Urban Grid Infrastructure. We design systems to increase the reliability, security and capacity of the urban grid infrastructure. Today, many urban substations are not networked and can only power a small section of a city. Our power dense technology based on proprietary smart materials allows for the inter-connection of substations, controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections. If one substation is compromised, other substations help increase capacity and reliability. Our system allows instantaneous power outage recovery, potentially doubling to quadrupling a city’s reliability and resiliency while minimizing grid investment. We design systems that leverage existing grid assets while protecting cities against storms, outages, and cyber- and physical attacks.

Grid market overview
 
It is widely believed that the electricity grids around the world require modernization through widespread technology upgrades if they are to maintain reliability while solving rapidly evolving challenges such as more frequent severe weather, threats of physical- and cyber-attacks, expanded renewable generation (both large and small scale) and new types of customer loads such as electric vehicles.  In fact, a series of reports written by the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI") in 2016 emphasize the need for increased resiliency, flexibility and connectivity in electric grids.  According to the EPRI reports, the number of geophysical, meteorological, hydrological, and climatological events in the U.S. rose to an all-time high of 247 events in 2010 – up from approximately 200 in 2009 and less than 200 in all years combined from 1980 to 2010.  Available data further indicate that the existing U.S. electrical grid has been stressed by U.S. wind power generation increasing from 6 Gigawatts ("GW") in 2003 to approximately 136 GW in 2021, and photovoltaics ("PV") power generation increasing from almost zero in 2003 to approximately 120 GW as of the end of 2021. 
 
Growth in both wind power and PV is expected to continue with the vast majority of such intermittent generation sources unsupported by energy storage, placing stress on the power grid.  Finally, the Edison Electric Institute estimates that the number of electric vehicles on the road in the U.S. is projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from more than 1.0 million at the end of 2018.  These facts and the dependence on the safety, security and economy of the electricity grid have prompted broad recognition worldwide of the need to modernize and enhance the reliability and security of power grids.
 
The Biden Administration’s energy plan, if enacted, could positively impact the demand for our new energy power systems solutions. The energy plan intends to reform and extend the tax incentives that generate energy efficiency and clean energy jobs as well as to develop financing mechanisms that leverage private sector dollars to maximize investment in the clean energy revolution. We plan to seek to collaborate with top tier wind turbine manufacturers to provide new wind farm connectivity to the U.S. power grid.
 
The Biden Administration also intends to spur the installation of millions of solar panels – including utility-scale, rooftop, and community solar systems. Our systems are primarily focused on addressing renewable energy installations for project developers and wind turbine manufacturers. Because solar power is dynamic and intermittently variable in nature, distribution grids will need to enhance their network’s capabilities to accommodate this new resource, while maintaining efficiency and power quality for their customers. Our system offers electric utilities superior power quality, environmental benefits, and significant cost-savings over traditional solutions.
 
The Biden Administration's energy policy also focuses on the next generation of electric grid transmission and distribution, which has been the heart of our long-term growth strategy. We believe our new energy power systems products are well suited to address this enormous challenge.

Power grid operators worldwide face various challenges, including:
 

• | Resiliency. As our electricity mix changes with the proliferation of renewables and distributed generation, so does the need to strengthen the electric grid. New technologies such as the addition of electric vehicles on U.S. roads and urbanization create new challenges for power grid operators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stability. Power grid operators are confronting power quality and stability issues arising from intermittent renewable energy sources and from the capacity limitations of transmission and overhead distribution lines and underground cables.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliability. Traditional transmission lines and cables often reach their reliable voltage stability limit well below their thermal threshold. Driving more power through a power grid when some lines and cables are operating above their voltage stability limit during times of peak demand can cause either unacceptably low voltage in the power grid (a brownout) or risk of a sudden, uncontrollable voltage collapse (a blackout).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capacity. The traditional way to enable increases in power grid capacity without losing voltage stability is to install more overhead power lines and underground cables. However, permitting new transmission and distribution lines can take 10 years or more due to various public policy issues, such as environmental, aesthetic, and health concerns. In urban and metropolitan areas, installing additional conventional underground copper cables is similarly challenging, since many existing underground corridors carrying power distribution cables are already filled to their physical capacity and cannot accommodate any additional conventional cables. In addition, adding new conduits requires excavation to expand existing corridors or create new corridors, which are costly and disruptive undertakings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiency. Most overhead lines and underground cables use traditional conductors such as copper and aluminum, which lose power due to electrical resistance. At transmission voltage, electrical losses average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line, quality of the conductor, and the power grid’s architecture and characteristics, among other factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Catastrophic equipment failures caused by aging equipment, physical and cyber events, and weather-related disasters can leave entire sections of an urban environment without power for hours or days. It can be difficult to recover from extended power outages in urban load centers, worsening situations where the personal safety of residents and the economic health of businesses are threatened. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our solutions for the power quality and grid infrastructure market
 
We address these challenges in the grid market by providing services and solutions designed to increase the power grid’s capacity, resiliency, reliability, security and efficiency.  Our solutions orchestrate the rhythm of power on the grid.  Our solutions include:
 

• | D-VAR® Systems. Our D-VAR system consists of power electronics and other static components used for controlling power flow and voltage in the AC transmission system. Our D-VAR system aims to increase controllability and power transferability of a network, which allows more effective utilization of existing assets, and reduces the need for new transmission lines and facilities to increase electricity availability. The power that flows through AC networks comprises both real power, measured in watts, and reactive power, measured in Volt Amp Reactive (“VARs”). In simple terms, reactive power is required to support voltage in the power network. D-VAR systems can provide the reactive power needed to stabilize voltage on the grid. These systems also can be used to connect wind farms and solar power plants to the power grid seamlessly as well as to protect certain industrial facilities against voltage swells and sags. Our D-VAR sales process begins with our group of experienced transmission planners working with power grid operators, renewable energy developers, and industrial system operators to identify power grid constraints and determine how our solutions might improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, and power quality systems for utilities and heavy industrial operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | actiVAR® Systems. Our actiVAR system is a fast-switching medium-voltage reactive compensation solution that utilizes passive, fast-switching, and transient-free switching devices. The actiVAR mitigates voltage sags and reduces large inrush currents associated with starting large medium-voltage motors across-the-line. Large motors require significant amounts of reactive power to start. The flow of VARs across the power system network results in voltage sags which cause power quality issues to nearby utility customers, as well as a reduction in the motors ability to start. Traditional solutions to solve these problems utilize complex and costly adjustable speed drives and synchronous transfer switchgear solutions. The actiVAR replaces these items at a fraction of the cost. The solution is prevalent in the pump and compressors stations utilized in industrial trades. Our actiVAR sales process begins with the engineering and procurement companies during feasibility studies. We identify viable projects for this solution and assist with performance and rating calculations, which eventually lead to the adaption and purchase of the actiVAR solution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | armorVAR™ Systems. Our armorVAR system consists of conventionally switched medium-voltage metal-enclosed capacitor banks and harmonic filters banks. These systems are installed for reactive compensation, power factor correction, loss reduction, utility bill savings, and mitigation of common power quality concerns related to power converter-based generation and load devices. They are utilized in all industries including renewables, industrial, utility, commercial, mining, and petro-chemical industries. Our armorVAR systems also support the base VAR requirements of renewable power plants and can include fully integrated D-VAR and D-VAR VVO® solutions to form more advanced hybrid solutions that are more economical and easier to install.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transformers and DC Rectifiers. Our custom transformers and rectifiers combine to form power electronic systems which consists of heavy-duty industrial rectifier transformers and direct current (DC) rectifiers. These systems are installed to produce DC power for electrolytic, furnace, and special processes. They are utilized in all industries including renewables, industrial, chemical, mining, and petro-chemical industries. Our power electronic systems also support renewable wind/solar power plants and can include fully integrated D-VAR and D-VAR VVO actiVAR®, armorVAR™ solutions that are more economical and easier to install to form a complete power solution engineered to the clients specification.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | D-VAR VVO®. Our D-VAR VVO serves the distribution power grid market. VVO is designed to be a direct-connect 15 kilovolt class power quality system for a utility's distribution network to optimally control voltage as distribution networks are increasingly impacted by distributed generation, such as roof top and community solar. We believe VVO has the potential to save utilities time and money by avoiding costly options to increase the reliability and resiliency of the distribution grid and to allow utilities to build a “plug 'n play” network to serve the demands of modern energy consumers. Our VVO target markets are electric distribution grids incorporating distributed generation, including where utility grid modernization attributes such as the following are applicable: mandated efficiency upgrades, mass adoption of rooftop solar, community solar, utility-owned micro-grids, variable load conditions on the distribution grid and voltage regulations alternatives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | REG Systems. Our REG system has two primary applications that increase the reliability and the capacity of the urban infrastructure. For applications focused on reliability improvement, the REG system is used in a “ring” or “loop” configuration to interconnect nearby urban substations. This enables urban utilities to share transmission connections and excess station capacity, while controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections, providing protection against the adverse effects that follow the loss of critical substation facilities in urban areas. We believe a utility installing our REG system could double or quadruple its reliability (e.g. N-1 to N-2, or greater) by networking substations, which is a solution that utilities would generally not consider when using conventional technology in urban settings due to its disruptive nature and economic disadvantages. For applications focused on capacity improvement, the REG system can be used in a “branch” configuration. In this application, the REG system connects an existing large urban substation with a new, much smaller, and more simplified substation within the city at a lower cost. The smaller urban substation does not need large power transformers and takes up much less space, thereby significantly reducing real estate, construction, and other related costs in the urban area. The key component to the REG system is a breakthrough cable system that combines very high-power handling capacity with fault current limiting characteristics - features that are attributable to our proprietary Amperium HTS wire.

Marine market overview
 
Defense spending has increased over the past six years as the U.S. military moves to rebuild and retool for competition against other great powers. In April 2022, the U.S. Navy’s 2022 shipbuilding plan covering government fiscal years 2023 to 2052, calls for a larger modernized, sustainable and lethal Navy. 
 
In September 2021, the Navy’s fleet numbered 294 battle force ships—aircraft carriers, submarines, surface combatants, amphibious ships, combat logistics ships, and some support ships. The Navy’s 2022 shipbuilding plan reflects its 2016 force structure assessment and sets a goal of building and maintaining a fleet of 355 battle force ships.
 
Since WWII, the Navy fleet has protected its warfare vessels with copper-based degaussing systems. Our HTS-based degaussing system provides world class mine protection while reducing the weight of the degaussing system by 50-80%, and reducing energy consumption.
 
We believe that our HTS systems are an enabling technology for the Navy in its mission to create an all-electric ship (Super Ship). Our HTS-based SPS degaussing system has been designed into the San Antonio-class amphibious warfare ship platform, with the first system delivered in January 2022 to be deployed on the USS Fort Lauderdale.  AMSC and the U.S. Navy have collaborated on AMSC’s advanced HTS-based ship protection systems. The core components of the ship protection system are common and transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation.
 
Navy fleets worldwide face various challenges, including:
 

• | Power Capacity. Today’s Navy continues to see increased demand for more power applied from both on and off the ship (shore power). This need is driven by many factors, including the continued development of high-power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Many power dense applications that naval engineers are working on today are already relying on the independent development of improved power distribution systems for its implementation. Free Electron Lasers, High Power Radar, Laser Self Defense Systems, Electro Magnetic Rail Guns and Active Denial (Directed Energy) systems are just a few of the Navy applications that we believe will demand higher capacity and more efficient energy transfer before deployment to a platform in the fleet can be realized.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Space and Weight Limitations. Advances in sensors and weapons for modern ship applications are expected to drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, for weapons’ power draw to be more efficiently cooled and for easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiency. Increased power demands for routine (peace time) operations are straining the conventional copper-based power cable systems that are currently used. The copper cables are very heavy, cumbersome, and hard to handle. The weight of the cables requires a coordinated effort between a crew on the pier and a crew on the ship. In many instances, handling these cables requires the use of a crane or a boom truck to extend them from the pier-side power substations up to the ship’s connection point. More efficient, compact, lighter weight power transfer and distribution systems are expected to be required for tomorrow’s Navy to satisfy its future mission requirements.

Our solutions for the marine market
 
Each Navy ship can be thought of as having its own power grid.  We provide advanced ship protection systems, power management, and power generation systems that are designed to help fleets increase system efficiencies, enhance warfare capabilities, and boost reliability, performance and security. Our systems support the Navy’s mission to “electrify the fleet”.  Our systems allow for the ship to generate a large amount of electrical power and distribute the power through an in-board power system to a propulsion motor by way of a much smaller, lighter, and higher performing HTS cable system, enabling a more advanced, reliable, and secure solution with a smaller footprint. Our solutions include:
 

• | Ship Protection Systems. The primary focus of our SPS has been degaussing systems. These systems reduce a naval ship’s magnetic signature, making it much more difficult for a mine to detect and damage a ship. Traditionally made of heavy copper wire, degaussing is required on all U.S. Navy combat ships. Our HTS advanced degaussing system is lightweight, compact, and often outperforms its conventional counterpart. This HTS system is estimated to enable 50-80% reduction in total degaussing system weight, offering significant potential for fuel savings or options to add different payloads. The core components of a degaussing system are transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation. Our SPS has been designed into the San Antonio class of amphibious assault vessels, which was first delivered in January 2022 to be deployed on the USS Fort Lauderdale. We are also seeking opportunities to propagate SPS throughout the surface fleet, creating the potential for a relatively long-term revenue stream. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Board Power Delivery Systems. We are working on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications, including in board power flow and management. The Navy continues to see increased demand for more power. This need is driven by many factors, including the continued development of high power density advanced weapons systems and sensors. Many power dense applications that naval engineers are working on today are already relying on improved power distribution systems for their implementation and deployment. Free Electron Lasers, High Power Radar, Laser Self Defense Systems, Electro Magnetic Rail Guns and Active Denial (Directed Energy) systems are just a few of the Navy applications that will demand higher capacity and more efficient energy transfer before deployment to a platform in the fleet can be realized. Continued space and weight limitations for these ship applications are expected to drive the need for new power solutions to be light and compact, easing installation on new ships and enabling upgrades on existing ones. Our HTS power cables enable high density energy transfer at unsurpassed efficiency levels in a compact, lightweight package. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Power Generation Systems. We are also working on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications including power generation and electric propulsion. The same HTS technology used in SPS and in board power delivery systems when applied to rotating machines results in high power density motors and generators. This enables dramatically more power to be produced in the same machinery space used for conventional systems, which in turn affords the Navy additional power for high energy density weapons without significant structural changes to the ship. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Propulsion systems. Our development work in power generation systems for the Navy extends to HTS-based electric power propulsion. In board power delivery systems and power generation systems, when applied to high power density motors, enable the transition to electric propulsion. This is expected to make new ships more fuel-efficient. Our technology and systems allow the Navy to free up space for additional war-fighting capability.

Wind market overview
 
The global energy mix is transitioning towards an increasing amount of renewable energy, including wind power. Wind power is unlimited in supply and its generation is a zero-emission process. Wind power has become a major pillar of power supply throughout the world. Wind power is expected to play a key role in the achievement of the objectives of the Paris Climate Change agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.
 
According to GlobalData, a research firm, approximately 91 GW of wind generation capacity were added worldwide in calendar 2021, as compared to 84 GW in calendar 2020. GlobalData anticipates that more than 85 GW of additional capacity will be added in 2022.
 
According to GlobalData, annual wind installations in India for calendar 2021 were 2.9 GW and for calendar 2022 are estimated to be 3.5 GW.
 
Several factors are expected to drive the future growth in the wind power market, including substantial government incentives and mandates that have been established globally, technological improvements, turbine cost reductions, the development of the offshore wind market, and increasing cost competitiveness with existing power generation technologies. Technological advances, declining turbine production cost and fluctuating prices for some fossil fuels continue to increase the competitiveness of wind versus traditional power generation technologies.
 
Our solutions for the wind market
 
We address the challenges of the wind power market by designing and engineering wind turbines, providing extensive support services to wind turbine manufacturers, and manufacturing and selling critical components for wind turbines.
 

• | Electrical Control Systems. We provide full electrical control systems (“ECS”) to manufacturers of wind turbines designed by us. Our ECS regulate voltage, control power flows and maximize wind turbine efficiency, among other functions. To date, we have shipped enough core electrical components and complete ECS to power over 16,000 Megawatts (“MW”) of wind power. We believe our ECS represent approximately 5-10% of a wind turbine’s bill of materials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wind Turbine Designs. We design and develop entire state-of-the-art onshore and offshore wind turbines with power ratings of 2 MWs and higher for manufacturers who are in the business of producing wind turbines or who plan to enter the business of manufacturing wind turbines. These customers typically pay us licensing fees, and in some cases royalties, for wind turbine designs, and purchase from us the ECS needed to operate the wind turbines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Support Services. We provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. These services range from providing designs for customers’ wind turbine manufacturing plants to establishing and localizing their supply chains and training their employees on proper wind turbine installation and maintenance. We believe these services enable customers to accelerate their entry into the wind turbine manufacturing market and lower the cost of their wind turbine platforms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our approach to the wind energy markets allows our customers to use our world-class turbine engineering capabilities while minimizing their research and development costs. These services and our advanced ECS provide our customers with the ability to produce standardized or next-generation wind turbines at scale for their local market or the global market quickly and cost-effectively.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our strategy is to serve customers locally in our core target markets through a direct sales force operating out of sales offices worldwide. In addition, we utilize manufacturers’ sales representatives in the United States and Canada to market our products to utilities in North America.  The sales force also leverages business development staff for our various offerings as well as our team of wind turbine engineers and power grid transmission planners, all of whom help to ensure that we have an in-depth understanding of customer needs and provide cost-effective solutions for those needs.
Segments
 
We segment our operations into two market-facing business units: Grid and Wind. We believe this market-centric structure enables us to more effectively anticipate and meet the needs of power generation project developers, the Navy's ship protection systems, electric utilities and wind turbine manufacturers.
Competition
 
We face competition in various aspects of our technology and product development. We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace depends upon several factors, including technical innovation, range of products and services, product quality and reliability, customer service and technical support.
 
We face competition from other companies offering FACTS systems similar to our D-VAR products. These include adaptive VAR compensators, Dynamic voltage restorers (“DVRs”), and STATCOMs produced by ABB, Siemens, Mitsubishi, RXHK, NR Electric Co,. and Ingeteam, and battery-based uninterruptable power supply (“UPS”) systems offered by various companies around the world.
 
We face competition from other companies offering medium-voltage metal-enclosed power capacitor banks and harmonic filter banks for use on electric power systems similar to our NEPSITM products. These include Controllix PowerSide, Elgin Power Solutions (formally Gilbert), Scott Engineering and QVARx.
 
We face competition from other companies offering DC power supply systems similar to our NeeltranTM products. These include Scr Controlled Rectifiers, IGBT controlled choppers produced by ABB, Siemens, Friem Dynapower, and Nidec offering systems around the world.
 
With our HTS-based REG product, we are offering a new approach that provides alternatives to utilities for power system design. Therefore, we believe that we compete with traditional approaches such as new full-sized substations, overhead and underground transmission, and urban power transformers.
 
We believe we are currently the only company that can offer HTS-based SPS products that have been fully qualified for use aboard U.S. Navy surface combatants.  Therefore, the primary competition for our SPS products is currently coming from defense contractors that provide the copper-based systems that our lighter, more efficient HTS versions have been developed to replace. Companies such as Ultra EMS, L3 Harris, and Raytheon have the bulk of the copper-based business today.
 
Our power module conversion equipment and our electrical control systems are designed and integrated into our wind turbine designs in a way to achieve maximum performance of the turbine. Typically, we are the exclusive provider of the power module conversion equipment and electrical control systems for our wind turbine designs. As a result, our power conversion equipment and electrical control systems see limited competition. Other companies that serve the wind turbine components industry include ABB, Hopewind and Semikron. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from global manufacturers of wind turbines, such as Siemens Gamesa, General Electric, Vestas and Suzlon. We face competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms such as Aerodyn and W2E.
 
Patents, licenses and trade secrets
 
Patent Background
 
An important part of our business strategy is to develop a strong worldwide patent position in all of our technology areas. Our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio includes both patents we own and patents we license from others. We devote substantial resources to building a strong patent position. Together with the international counterparts of our patents and patent applications, we own an extensive portfolio of patents and patent applications worldwide and have rights through exclusive and non-exclusive licenses. We believe that our current patent position, together with our ability to obtain licenses from other parties to the extent necessary, will provide us with sufficient proprietary rights to develop and sell our products. However, for the reasons described below, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.
 
Despite the strength of our patent position, a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications of third parties relate to our current products, to products we are developing, or to technology we are now using in the development or production of our products. We may need to acquire licenses to those patents, contest the scope or validity of those patents, or design around patented processes or products as necessary. If companies holding patents or patent applications that we need to license are competitors, we believe the strength of our patent portfolio will improve our ability to enter into license or cross-license arrangements with these companies. We have already successfully negotiated cross-licenses with several competitors.
 
Failure to obtain all necessary patents, licenses and other IP rights upon reasonable terms could significantly reduce the scope of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not now know the likelihood of successfully contesting the scope or validity of patents held by others. In any event, we could incur substantial costs in challenging the patents of other companies. Moreover, third parties could challenge some of our patents or patent applications, and we could incur substantial costs in defending the scope and validity of our own patents or patent applications whether or not a challenge is ultimately successful.
 
Grid Patents
 
We have received patents and filed a significant number of additional patent applications on power quality and reliability systems, including our D-VAR products. Our products are covered by patents and patents pending worldwide on both our systems and power converter products. The patents and applications focus on inventions that significantly improve product performance and reduce product costs, thereby providing a competitive advantage. 
 
  10 



HTS Patents
 
Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors in 1986, rapid technical advances have characterized the HTS industry, which in turn have resulted in a large number of patents, including overlapping patents, relating to superconductivity. As a result, the patent situation in the field of HTS technology and products is unusually complex. We have obtained licenses to patents and patent applications covering some HTS materials. We currently have non-exclusive rights to a fundamental U.S. patent (U.S. 8,060,169 B1) covering 2G and similar HTS wire and applications and may elect in the future to allow our rights under this license to lapse. However, we may have to obtain additional licenses to HTS materials.
 
We are focusing on the production of our Amperium wire, and we intend to continue to maintain a leadership position in 2G HTS wire through a combination of patents, licenses and proprietary expertise. In addition to our owned patents and patent applications in 2G HTS wire, we have obtained licenses from (i) MIT for the MOD process we use to deposit the YBCO layer, and (ii) Alcatel-Lucent on the YBCO material.
 
We have extensive patents and patents pending covering applications of HTS wire, such as HTS fault current limiting technology including our fault current limiting cable, HTS rotating machines and ship protection systems. Since the superconductor rotating machine and the fault current limiting cable applications are relatively new, we believe that we have a particularly strong patent position in these areas.  At present, we believe we have the world’s broadest and most fundamental patent position in superconductor rotating machines technology. We have also filed a series of patents on our concept for our proprietary fault current limiting technology. However, there can be no assurance that that these patents will be sufficient to assure our freedom of action in these fields without further licensing from others. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding the status of the commercialization of our Amperium wire products.
 
Wind Patents
 
Under our Windtec™ Solutions brand, we design a variety of wind turbine systems and license these designs, including expertise and patent rights, to third parties for an upfront fee, plus in some cases, future royalties. Our wind turbine designs are covered by patents and patents pending worldwide on wind turbine technology. We have patent coverage on the unique design features of our blade pitch control system, which ensures optimal aerodynamic flow conditions on the turbine blades and improves system efficiency and performance. The pitch system includes a patented SafetyLOCK™ feature that causes the blades to rotate to a feathered position to prevent the rotor blades from spinning during a fault.
Trade Secrets
 
Some of the important technology used in our operations and products is not covered by any patent or patent application owned by or licensed to us. However, we take steps to maintain the confidentiality of this technology by requiring all employees and all consultants to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access to confidential information. We cannot provide any assurance that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of that information. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that others, including our competitors, will not independently develop the same or comparable technology that is one of our trade secrets.
Human Capital
 
We aim to provide a safe and positive work environment for our employees that emphasizes respect for individuals and high standards of integrity.  The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate.  As of March 31, 2022, we employed 326 persons. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.
 
We believe our employees are the foundation of our success and that our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain the best and brightest talent, including key management professionals, scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturing personnel, and marketing and sales professionals.  In order for us to attract the best talent, we provide a collaborative, inclusive and innovative work environment, competitive compensation, and opportunities for our employees to grow. We are focused on continuing to build an inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking, and supports the development and advancement of all.
 
Our human capital management objectives include attracting, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and future employees. We strive to attract and retain talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health and financial well-being. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards and stock-based compensation. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate employees through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to address local laws and cultures and to be competitive in the marketplace.

 1. Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity
   Nature of the Business and Operations
   American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on  April 9, 1987. The Company is a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that Orchestrate the Rhythm and Harmony of Power on the Grid™ and protect and expand the capability of the Navy's fleet. The Company’s products leverage its proprietary “smart materials” and “smart software and controls” to provide enhanced resiliency and improved performance of megawatt-scale power flow.   The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-K. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue operations and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.   Liquidity
   The Company has historically experienced recurring operating losses and as of  March 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1,020.5 million. In addition, the Company has historically experienced recurring negative operating cash flows.  At  March 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $40.6 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended  March 31, 2022 was $19.0 million.   In  February 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will expire in  February 2024 (the “Form S-3”). The Form S-3 allows the Company to offer and sell from time-to-time up to $250 million of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities. The Form S-3 is intended to provide the Company flexibility to conduct registered sales of the Company's securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund the Company's future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Form S-3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.   On  May 6, 2021 (the "Neeltran Acquisition Date"), the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Real Property Purchase Agreement") and a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Neeltran Stock Purchase Agreement") with the selling equity holders named therein. Also on  May 6, 2021, pursuant to the Real Property Purchase Agreement, the Company's wholly-owned Connecticut limited liability company, AMSC Husky LLC ("AMSC Husky"), purchased the real property that served as Neeltran's headquarters for $4.3 million, of which (a) $2.4 million was paid in immediately available funds by AMSC Husky to the owners of such real property, and (b) $1.9 million was paid directly to TD Bank as full payment for the outstanding indebtedness secured by the mortgage on such real property.  Pursuant to the terms of the Neeltran Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of (i) Neeltran, Inc., a Connecticut corporation ("Neeltran") that supplies rectifiers and transformers to industrial customers, and (ii) Neeltran International, Inc., a Connecticut corporation ("International"), for: (a) $1.0 million in cash, and (b) 301,556 shares of the Company's common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "AMSC Shares"), that were paid and issued to the Neeltran selling stockholders, respectively at closing (the "Neeltran Acquisition"). The Company also paid $1.1 million to International selling stockholders at closing to pay off previous loans made by them to Neeltran. Additionally, the Company paid approximately $7.6 million on behalf of the selling equity holders, including $1.9 million of indebtedness secured by the mortgage on the real property as described above, directly to Neeltran lenders at closing to extinguish outstanding Neeltran indebtedness to third parties on behalf of the sellers.   In  March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19“) to be a pandemic. COVID-19 has spread throughout the globe, including in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where the Company’s headquarters are located, and in other areas where the Company has business operations. In response to the outbreak, the Company has followed the guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and applicable state government authorities to protect the health and safety of the Company’s employees, families, suppliers, customers and communities. While these existing measures and, COVID-19 generally, have not materially disrupted the Company’s business to date, any future actions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic  may result in disruption to the Company’s business.   The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The Company is experiencing substantial inflationary pressure in its supply chain, some delays in sourcing materials needed for its products and some production disruption resulting from higher than typical employee absenteeism due to the highly contagious omicron variant, all of which have increased the Company’s cost of revenues and decreased gross margin. The extent to which the outbreak impacts the Company’s business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.  Changes in macroeconomic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, including inflation, labor force availability, sourcing, material delays and global supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation.          41
  
   The Company believes that based on the information presented above and its annual management assessment, it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months following the issuance of the financial statements for the year ended  March 31, 2022. The Company’s liquidity is highly dependent on its ability to increase revenues, its ability to control its operating costs, and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary. The impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic and other sources of instability, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, on the global financing markets  may reduce the Company's ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's liquidity.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital, on favorable terms or at all, from other sources or execute on any other means of improving liquidity described above.  

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    Basis of Consolidation
   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. 
   Use of Estimates
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration, warranty provisions, stock-based compensation, tax reserves, and deferred tax assets. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results  may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by the Company’s management there  may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, the Company believes that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements.     Cash Equivalents
   Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.     Marketable Securities
   Marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than 12 months that are measured using such inputs as quoted prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.  All marketable securities are considered available for sale and are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded to other income (expense), net.  The Company periodically reviews the realizability of each short and long term marketable security when impairment indicators exist with respect to the security.  If other than temporary impairment of value of the security exists, the carrying value of the security is written down to its estimated fair value.     Accounts Receivable
   Accounts receivable consist of amounts owed by commercial companies and government agencies. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of customers. As of  March 31, 2022, Fuji Bridex PTE Ltd accounted for approximately 31% of the Company's accounts receivable balance, with no other customers accounting for greater than 10% of the balance. As of  March 31, 2021, Naval Surface Warfare Center accounted for approximately 28%, and RWE Renewables, LLC accounted for approximately 11% of our accounts receivable balance, with no other customers accounting for greater than 10% of the balance. Changes in the financial condition or operations of the Company’s customers  may result in delayed payments or non-payments which would adversely impact its cash flows from operating activities and/or its results of operations. As such, the Company  may require collateral, advanced payment or other security based upon the customer history and/or creditworthiness. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily on the probability of recoverability based on historical collection and write-off experience, the age of past due receivables, specific customer circumstances, and current economic trends. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional allowances  may be required. Failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.     Inventory
   Inventories include material, direct labor and related manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value determined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company records inventory when it takes delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract.   Program costs  may be deferred and recorded as inventory on contracts on which costs are incurred in excess of approved contractual amounts and/or funding, if future recovery of the costs is deemed probable.
       42
  
  At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. Inventories that management considers excess or obsolete are reserved. Management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.   For the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded inventory reserves of approximately $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, based on evaluating its ending inventory on hand for excess quantities and obsolescence.     Leases
   Leases include all agreements in which the Company obtains control of a physical asset.  Leases are captured on the balance sheet as both a right of use asset and associated lease liability and are valued based on the commencement of the Company's control of the asset, after being discounted by its incremental borrowing rate.  The Company's lease portfolio is made up primarily of real estate leases for its various offices, but also include items such as vehicles, IT equipment and other miscellaneous tools and equipment needed for manufacturing.  The Company's incremental borrowing rate was determined through an analysis to identify what rates it could obtain if the Company were to secure external financing for similar transactions, and includes considerations of both the market and its current credit ratings.  An analysis is performed annually, or upon execution of any individually material agreement, to ensure that the rates being applied to newly acquired leases are still accurate.   The majority of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, and therefore the expense is captured in income from operations each period.   We have elected to exclude all leases of less than twelve months from the balance sheet presentation.  We have also elected a policy in which we will not segregate lease components from non-lease components, so in the event we execute an agreement which includes a non-lease component our asset and liability recorded to the balance sheet will include the value of that non-lease component as well.  This policy will be applied to all classifications of leases.     Property, Plant and Equipment
   Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company accounts for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:    
Asset Classification | Estimated Useful Life in Years 
------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
Machinery and equipment | 3-10 
Furniture and fixtures | 3-5 
Leasehold improvements | Shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term

    Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.     Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
   The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, consisting principally of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets, for potential impairment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the treatment of long-lived assets, the Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets or asset group that is held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets  may not be recoverable. Under the held and used approach, the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets  may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.   There were no indicators requiring impairment testing on the Company's long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021.     Goodwill
   Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill on  February 28th of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable. Determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit based on an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow adjusted for entity specific factors. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an entity should consider the totality of all relevant events or circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized reducing the goodwill by the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the that reporting unit. See Note 5, "Goodwill" for further information and discussion.   The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on  February 28, 2022 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to  March 31, 2022 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.  Additionally, there was no impairment identified for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021 based on the assessment performed in the prior fiscal year.      43         Revenue Recognition 
   Revenue contracts are defined as an arrangement that creates enforceable rights and obligations of both parties where collection of the contract price is deemed probable. The Company records revenue based on a five-step model which includes confirmation of contract existence, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control  can occur at the time of delivery, installation or post-installation where applicable.  
   The Company's equipment and system product line includes certain contracts which do not meet the requirements of an exchange transaction and therefore do not fall within the scope of ASC 606.  As these non-exchange transaction contracts are considered grant revenue and do not fall within any specific accounting literature, the Company follows guidance within ASC 606 by analogy to recognize grant revenue over time.    For certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales, the Company records revenues using the over-time method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Over-time revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long-term prototype development contracts with the U.S. government. The Company follows this method when any of the three following criteria are met: when the customer receives the benefits as they are performed, control transfers to the customer as the work is performed, or there is no alternative use to the Company and there is an enforceable right to payment through the life of the contract. However, the ability to reliably estimate total costs at completion is challenging, especially on long-term prototype development contracts, and could result in future changes in contract estimates. For contracts where reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs cannot be made, the Company follows the point in time method.
   The Company enters into sales arrangements that  may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. Sales of certain products  may include extended warranty and support or service packages, and at times include performance bonds. As these contracts progress, the Company continually assesses the probability of a payout from the performance bond. Should the Company determine that such a payout is likely, the Company would record a liability. The Company would reduce revenue to the extent a liability is recorded. In addition, the Company enters into licensing arrangements that include training services.
   Performance obligations are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (1) the delivered element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and (2) the Company's promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.  In general, revenues are separated between the different product shipments which have stand-alone value, and the various services to be provided. Revenue for product shipments is generally recognized at a point in time where control of the product is transferred to the customer, while revenues for the services are generally recognized over the period of performance. The Company identifies all goods and/or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price ("SSP") which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach for products and a relief from royalty method for licenses.  Revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.  The Company reviews SSP and the related margins at least annually. 
     44        The Company’s license agreements provide either for the payment of contractually determined paid-up front license fees or milestone based payments in consideration for the grant of rights to manufacture and/or sell products using its patented technologies or know-how. Some of these agreements provide for the release of the licensee from past and future intellectual property infringement claims. When the Company can determine that it has no further obligations other than the grant of the license and that the Company has fully transferred the technology know-how, the Company recognizes the revenue under a point in time model. In other license arrangements, the Company  may also agree to provide training services to transfer the technology know-how.  In these arrangements, the Company has determined that the licenses have no standalone value to the customer and are not separable from training services as the Company can only fully transfer the technology know-how through the training component. Accordingly, the Company accounts for these arrangements as a single unit of accounting, and recognizes revenue over the period of its performance using the over-time method. Costs for these arrangements are expensed as incurred.   Existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined that collectability of any portion of the contract value is not probable, an analysis of variable consideration will be performed using either the most likely amount or expected value method to determine the amount of revenue that must be constrained until the scenario causing the variability has been resolved. For contractual arrangements that involve variable consideration, the Company recognizes revenue for these amounts upon reaching the constraining event successfully.  The Company does not generally provide for extended payment terms or provide its customers with a right of return.
   Infrequently, the Company receives requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for a valid business purpose. The Company recognizes revenues for such arrangements provided the transaction meets, at a minimum, the following criteria: a valid business purpose for the arrangement exists; risk of ownership of the purchased product has been transferred to the buyer; there is a fixed delivery date that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer’s business purpose; the product is ready for shipment; there are no continuing performance obligation in regards to the purchased product and these products have been segregated from the Company's inventories and cannot be used to fill other orders received. Revenue for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2022 included $1.2 million from such held transactions. There were no such transactions in fiscal 2020.
   The Company has elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and does not include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue.   The Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances.   
Business Acquisitions
   The Company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets, if identified, are also recorded at fair value.  The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.   Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions as well as the use of specialists as needed.   The consideration for its acquisitions  may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. The Company records a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and the likelihood of making related payments. Each period the Company revalues the contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition to fair value and records changes in the fair value within the operating expenses in its consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in assumed revenue risk premium and volatility, as well as changes in the stock price and assumed probability with respect to the attainment of certain financial and operational metrics, among others. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the fair value of contingent consideration recorded at each reporting period. See Note 3, "Acquisitions," for additional information.     Product Warranty
   Warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s products.  The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically one to three years, and extended service-type warranties at the customers’ option for an additional term ranging up to four additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the service.  The costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required.     Research and Development Costs
   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.      45         Income Taxes
   The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.   Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future fiscal years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. and Romania deferred income tax assets since the Company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets are not currently realizable due to uncertainty around profitability in the future.   Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company includes interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.  See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.     Stock-Based Compensation
   The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions using a fair value-based method and recognizes the related expense in the results of operations.   Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards with service and performance conditions. For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service/vesting period. For awards with performance conditions, estimates of compensation cost are made based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.   Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatilities of the Company’s common stock and expected terms. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s common stock. The expected term represents the average time that the options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and the Company’s historical exercise, cancellation and expiration patterns.   The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense based on historical and forward-looking factors. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience  may result in significant, unanticipated increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of stock-based awards  may also have a significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on stock-based compensation expense. The Company will update these assumptions on at least an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted.   The Company accounts for share-based payments made to non-employees in the same manner as other share-based payments for employees, with the measurement being based on the fair value at the grant date. The non-employee share based payments will be included within the Company's stock compensation currently reported.
      46         Computation of Net Loss per Common Share
   Basic net loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares include the effect of restricted stock, exercise of stock options and warrants and contingently issuable shares. For the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, common equivalent shares of 495,402, and 436,139, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were considered antidilutive. The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the EPS calculation for the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands except per share amounts):

       Foreign Currency Translation
   The functional currency of all the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for AMSC Austria, for which the local currency (Euro) is the functional currency, and AMSC China, for which the local currency (Renminbi) is the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of AMSC Austria and AMSC China are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are excluded from net loss and shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations was less than $0.1 million and $0.7 million, for the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has no restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of its foreign subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends and other distributions.     Risks and Uncertainties
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and would impact future results of operations and cash flows.   The Company invests its available cash in high credit, quality financial instruments and invests primarily in investment-grade marketable securities, including, but not limited to, government obligations, money market funds and corporate debt instruments.   Several of the Company’s government contracts are being funded incrementally, and as such, are subject to the future authorization, appropriation, and availability of government funding. The Company has a history of successfully obtaining financing under incrementally-funded contracts with the U.S. government and it expects to continue to obtain additional contract modifications in the year ending  March 31, 2023 and beyond as incremental funding is authorized and appropriated by the government.     Contingencies
   From time to time, the Company  may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If, with respect to a matter, it is not both probable to result in liability and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, an estimate of possible loss or range of loss is disclosed unless such an estimate cannot be made. The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for further information.     Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
   The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and derivatives. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued expenses due to their short nature approximate fair value at  March 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates.  Marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than 12 months that are measured using such inputs as quoted prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.  All marketable securities are considered available for sale and are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded to other income (expense), net. The fair value for the contingent consideration is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date.  The fair value for the warrant arrangements was historically estimated by management based on various assumptions in a lattice model and was subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date.  The Company classifies the estimates used to fair value these instruments as Level 3 inputs. See Note 6, “Fair Value Measurements” for a full discussion on fair value measurements.      47          3. Acquisitions
     2021 Acquisition of Neeltran
   As described in Note 1, "Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity", on the Neeltran Acquisition Date, pursuant to the terms of the Neeltran Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Neeltran and International for $1.0 million in cash and the AMSC Shares, that were paid and issued, respectively, to the Neeltran selling stockholders. The Company also paid $1.1 million to International selling stockholders to pay off previous loans made by them to Neeltran.   Additionally, the Company paid approximately $7.6 million, including $1.9 million of indebtedness secured by the mortgage on the real property as described below, directly to Neeltran lenders at closing to extinguish outstanding Neeltran indebtedness to third parties. Pursuant to the terms of the Real Property Purchase Agreement, AMSC Husky purchased the real property that serves as Neeltran's headquarters for $4.3 million, of which (a) $2.4 million was paid from immediately available funds by AMSC Husky to the selling parties, and (b) $1.9 million was paid directly to TD Bank as full payment for the outstanding indebtedness secured by the mortgage on such real property. The total purchase price of $16.4 million includes cash paid, the fair value of the AMSC Shares issued at closing and the debt payoff on behalf of the sellers as follows (in millions):    
Cash payment | $ | 4.4 
---------------------------------------------------------+---+-----
Issuance of 301,556 shares of Company's common stock | | 4.4 
Debt payment to third party lenders on behalf of sellers | | 7.6 
Total consideration | $ | 16.4

    The Neeltran Acquisition completed by the Company during the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2022, has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of Neeltran Acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. As Neeltran was previously a private company, the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842 ("ASC 842") was completed as part of the Neeltran Acquisition. See Note 15 "Leases" for further details. Neeltran had previously adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") as part of prior year audited financial statements.    The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Neeltran Acquisition (in millions):      
Cash and short-term investments | $ | 0.5 | 
---------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------+--
Net working capital (excluding inventory and deferred revenue) | | (0.9 | )
Inventory | | 9.0 | 
Property, plant and equipment | | 6.5 | 
Deferred revenue | | (10.0 | )
Deferred tax liability | | (2.3 | )
Net tangible assets/(liabilities) | | 2.8 | 
Backlog | | 0.1 | 
Trade names and trademarks | | 1.2 | 
Customer relationships | | 3.5 | 
Net identifiable intangible assets/(liabilities) | | 4.8 | 
Goodwill | | 8.8 | 
Total purchase consideration | $ | 16.4 | 

      Inventory includes a $0.6 million adjustment to step up the inventory balance to fair value consistent with the purchase price allocation. The fair value was based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling cost and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. The inventory step up adjustment increased cost of revenue by $0.6 million in the twelve month period ended  March 31, 2022 as the inventory was sold. This increase is not reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations because it does not have a continuing impact beyond the first year.   Backlog of $0.1 million was evaluated using the multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The contracts with customers do not provide for any guarantees to source all future requirements from the Company. The amortization method being utilized is economic consumption estimated over a two year period with the expense being allocated to cost of revenues. Customer relationships of $3.5 million relates to customers currently under contract and was determined based on a multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The method of amortization being utilized is the economic consumption over 7 years with the expense being allocated to SG&A. Trade names and trademarks of $1.2 million were reviewed using the assumption that the Company would continue to utilize the Neeltran trade name indefinitely. The relief from royalty method was utilized using a 1% royalty rate on revenues with a 24.5% discount rate over 15 years. The goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and expected synergies related to the business combinations of the two companies. Goodwill resulting from the Neeltran Acquisition was assigned to the Company's Grid business segment. Goodwill recognized in the Neeltran Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company has finalized its purchase price allocation for the Neeltran Acquisition, and there were no changes to the net assets and goodwill recorded by the Company as of  May 6, 2021. 
  The results of Neeltran's operations, are included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of the Neeltran Acquisition of  May 6, 2021. In the consolidated results for the twelve months ended  March 31, 2022 , Neeltran contributed $21.4 million of revenue and  $3.4 million in net loss for the Company.      Acquisition of NEPSI
  On  October 1, 2020 (the “NEPSI Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding (i) shares of capital stock of Northeast Power Systems, Inc., a New York corporation (“NEPSI”), and (ii) membership interests of Northeast Power Realty, LLC, a New York limited liability company, which holds the real property that serves as NEPSI’s headquarters (the "NEPSI Acquisition"). NEPSI is a U.S.-based global provider of medium-voltage metal-enclosed power capacitor banks and harmonic filter banks for use on electric power systems. NEPSI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is operated by its Grid business unit. The purchase price was $26.0 million in cash and 873,657 restricted shares of common stock of the Company. As part of the transaction, the selling stockholders  may receive up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain specified revenue objectives during varying periods of up to four years following closing of the NEPSI Acquisition. Prior to the NEPSI Acquisition, the Company had purchased $0.4 million of products from NEPSI in fiscal year 2019 for which NEPSI was paid and had recorded revenue.   The NEPSI Acquisition completed by the Company during the twelve months ended  March 31, 2021 has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.  As NEPSI was previously a private company, the adoption of ASC 606 was completed as part of the NEPSI Acquisition.  See Note 4 "Revenue Recognition" for further details.  There were no leases acquired and the NEPSI Acquisition had no impact to the Company's reporting under ASC 842.
   The total purchase price of approximately $42.4 million includes the fair value of shares of the Company’s common stock issued at closing, cash paid, and contingent consideration as follows (in millions):    
Cash payment | $ | 26.0
-----------------------------------------------------+---+-----
Issuance of 873,657 shares of Company’s common stock | | 12.4
Contingent consideration | | 4.0 
Total consideration | $ | 42.4

    Total consideration consists of (a) cash of $26.0 million, (b) issuance of the Company's common stock, using $14.23 per share, which was the closing price on the day that the Company acquired NEPSI, and (c) $4.0 million of contingent consideration for the earnout liability valued as of the NEPSI Acquisition Date. NEPSI Acquisition costs of $0.3 million were recorded in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") costs for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021.
   The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a Monte Carlo model and is accounted for as a derivative liability which is revalued at the fair value determined at each subsequent balance sheet date until the contingencies are resolved and the shares to be issued are determined, with the change in fair value recorded in the current period operating loss.  See Note 12, "Contingent Consideration" for further details and a summary of key assumptions used to determine fair value in each period.   The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes in connection with the NEPSI Acquisition (in millions):    
Net working capital (excluding inventory and deferred revenue) | $ | 0.1 | 
---------------------------------------------------------------+---+------+--
Inventory | | 4.2 | 
Property, plant and equipment | | 2.3 | 
Deferred revenue | | (2.7 | )
Deferred tax liability | | (1.7 | )
Net tangible assets/(liabilities) | | 2.2 | 
Backlog | | 0.6 | 
Trade names and trademarks | | 0.6 | 
Customer relationships | | 6.1 | 
Net identifiable intangible assets/(liabilities) | | 7.3 | 
Goodwill | | 32.9 | 
Total purchase consideration | $ | 42.4 | 

    Inventory includes a $1.0 million adjustment to step up the inventory balance to fair value consistent with the purchase price allocation.  The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling cost and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. The $1.0 million step up adjustment increased cost of revenue in the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021, as the inventory was sold.  This increase is not reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations because it does not have a continuing impact beyond the first year.   Backlog of $0.6 million was evaluated using the multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The contracts with customers do not provide for any guarantees to source all future requirements from the Company. The amortization method being utilized is economic consumption estimated over a two year period with the expense being allocated to cost of revenues.   Customer relationships of $6.1 million relates to customers currently under contract and was determined based on a multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The method of amortization being utilized is the economic consumption over 7 years with the expense being allocated to SG&A.   Trade names and trademarks of $0.6 million were reviewed, using the assumption that the Company would continue to utilize the NEPSI trade name indefinitely. The relief from royalty method was utilized using an 8% royalty rate on revenues with a 13% discount rate over 8 years.        48
  
  Goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and expected synergies related to the business combination of the two companies. Goodwill resulting from the NEPSI Acquisition was assigned to the Company’s Grid segment.  Goodwill recognized in the NEPSI Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The $1.7 million of deferred tax liability is primarily related to inventory step up and intangibles.      Unaudited Pro Forma Operating Results
    The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended   March 31, 2022 and  2021 is presented as if the NEPSI Acquisition and Neeltran Acquisition had occurred on  April 1, 2020.

   4. Revenue Recognition
   The Company’s revenues in its Grid segment are derived primarily through enabling the transmission and distribution of power, providing planning services that allow it to identify power grid needs and risks, and developing ship protection systems for the U.S. Navy. The Company’s revenues in its Wind segment are derived primarily through supplying advanced power electronics and control systems, licensing its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and providing extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC 606. For its customer contracts, the Company identifies the performance obligations, determines the transaction price, allocates the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizes the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. As of  March 31, 2022, 76% of revenue was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time. In the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021, 78% of revenue was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time.   In the Company's equipment and system product line, each contract with a customer summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company’s product sales transfer control to the customer in line with the contracted delivery terms and revenue is recorded at the point in time when title and risk transfer to the customer, as the Company has determined that this is the point in time that control transfers to the customer.   The Company's equipment and system product line includes certain contracts which do not meet the requirements of an exchange transaction and therefore do not fall within the scope of ASC 606.  As these non-exchange transaction contracts are considered grant revenue and do not fall within any specific accounting literature, the Company follows guidance within ASC 606 by analogy to recognize grant revenue over time.  In the year ended  March 31, 2022, the Company recorded $1.1 million in grant revenue, which is included in the Company’s Grid revenue. There was $3.9 million in grant revenue recorded in the year ended  March 31, 2021, which is included in the Company's Grid revenue.     49        In the Company's service and technology development product line, there are several different types of transactions and each begins with a contract with a customer that summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. The technology development transactions are primarily for activities that have no alternative use and for which a profit can be expected throughout the life of the contract. In these cases, the revenue is recognized over time, but in the instances where the profit cannot be assured throughout the entire contract then the revenue is recognized at a point in time. Each contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach. The ongoing service transactions are for service contracts that provide benefit to the customer simultaneously as the Company performs its obligations, and therefore this revenue is recognized ratably over time throughout the effective period of these contracts. The transaction prices on these contracts are allocated based on an adjusted market approach which is re-assessed annually for reasonableness. The field service transactions include contracts for delivery of goods and completion of services made at the customer's requests, which are not deemed satisfied until the work has been completed and/or the requested goods have been delivered, so all of this revenue is recognized at the point in time when the control changes, and at allocated prices based on the adjusted market approach driven by standard price lists. The royalty transactions are related to certain contract terms on transactions in the Company's equipment and systems product line based on activity as specified in the contracts. The transaction prices of these agreements are calculated based on an adjusted market approach as specified in the contract. The Company reports royalty revenue for usage-based royalties when the sales have occurred. In circumstances when collectability is not assured and a contract does not exist under ASC 606, revenue is deferred until a non-refundable payment has been received for substantially all the amount that is due and there are no further remaining performance obligations.   The Company's service contracts can include a purchase order from a customer for specific goods in which each item is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time at which control of the goods is transferred to the customer which occurs based on the contracted delivery terms or when the requested service work has been completed. The transaction price for these goods is allocated based on the adjusted market approach considering similar transactions under similar circumstances. Service contracts are also derived from ongoing maintenance contracts and extended service-type warranty contracts. In these transactions, the Company is contracted to provide an ongoing service over a specified period of time. As the customer is consuming the benefits as the service is being provided the revenue is recognized over time ratably.   The Company’s policy is to not accept volume discounts, product returns, or rebates and allowances within its contracts. In the event a contract was approved with any of these terms, it would be evaluated for variable consideration, estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related product revenue was recorded.   The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically one to three years, and extended service-type warranties at the customers’ option for an additional term ranging up to four additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the services.   The Company records revenue net of sales tax, value added tax, excise tax and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over the products sold passes to customers and revenue is recognized. The Company has elected to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred except in contracts where the amortization period would exceed twelve months; in such cases the long term amount will be assessed for materiality. The Company has elected to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the period of financing is twelve months or less.    The Company’s contracts with customers do not typically include extended payment terms and  may include milestone billing over the life of the contract. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days from delivery.   The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by product line and by shipment destination:

      50        In the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, 38% and 41% of the Company’s revenues, respectively, were recognized from sales outside the United States. The Company maintains operations in Austria and the United States and sales and service support centers around the world.   As of  March 31, 2022 and  March 31, 2021, the Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. Changes in the Company’s contract assets, which are included in “Unbilled Accounts Receivable” and “Deferred program costs” (see Note 7, “Accounts Receivable” and Note 8, “Inventory” for a reconciliation to the condensed consolidated balance sheet) and contract liabilities, which are included in the current portion and long term portion of “deferred revenue” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, are as follows:

    The Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of the Company’s contractual commitments. The Company’s performance obligations  may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of major new contractual commitments. As of  March 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding performance obligations on existing contracts under ASC 606 to be recognized in the next twelve months of approximately $78.4 million. There are also approximately $6.6 million of outstanding performance obligations to be recognized over a period of thirteen to sixty months. The remaining performance obligations are subject to customer actions and therefore the timing of revenue recognition cannot be reasonably estimated. The twelve month performance obligations include anticipated shipments to Inox based on the twelve month rolling forecast provided by Inox on the multi-year supply contract. The quantities specified in any forecast provided by Inox related to the multi-year supply contract are firm and irrevocable for the first three months of a twelve-month rolling forecast. The timing of the performance obligations beyond the twelve-month forecast provided by Inox are not determinable and therefore are not included in the total remaining performance obligations.
   The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021:

 5. Goodwill
   The guidance under ASC 805-30 provides for the recognition of goodwill on the acquisition date measured as the excess of the aggregate consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company's goodwill balance relates to the Neeltran Acquisition in fiscal 2021, the NEPSI Acquisition in fiscal 2020, and Infinia Technology Corporation in fiscal 2017 and is reported in the Grid business segment.     Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed annually on  February 28th and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill might not be recoverable.   The following table provides a roll forward of the changes in our Grid business segment goodwill balance:    
 | Goodwill | 
---------------------+----------+-------
March 31, 2020 | $ | 1,719 
NEPSI Acquisition | | 32,915
March 31, 2021 | $ | 34,634
Neeltran Acquisition | | 8,837 
March 31, 2022 | $ | 43,471

      The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on  February 28, 2022 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to  March 31, 2022 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.  Additionally, no impairment resulted from the assessment performed in the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021.

 6. Fair Value Measurements
   A valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value has been established. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:   
Level 1 | - | Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
--------+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 | - | Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).
Level 3 | - | Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data. 

   The Company provides a gross presentation of activity within Level 3 measurement roll-forward and details of transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements.  A change in the hierarchy of an investment from its current level is reflected in the period during which the pricing methodology of such investment changes.  Disclosure of the transfer of securities from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 is made in the event that the related security is significant to total cash and investments.  The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities from Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended  March 31, 2022.   A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   Valuation Techniques
   Cash Equivalents
   Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.   Marketable Securities
   Marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit with maturities of less than 12 months that are measured using such inputs as quoted prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.  All marketable securities are considered available for sale and are carried at fair value. The Company had no outstanding marketable securities as of  March 31, 2022 and the Company recognized no change in the twelve months ended  March 31, 2022. The Company recognized less than $0.1 million in unrealized gains on marketable securities, which is recorded in other income, for the fiscal year ending  March 31, 2021. 
   The Company periodically reviews the realizability of each short and long term marketable security when impairment indicators exist with respect to the security.  If other than temporary impairment of value of the security exists, the carrying value of the security is written down to its estimated fair value.   Contingent Consideration
   Contingent consideration relates to the earnout payment for the NEPSI Acquisition. See Note 3 "Acquisitions" and Note 12, "Contingent Consideration" for further discussion. The Company relied on a Monte Carlo simulation pricing method to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration on the NEPSI Acquisition Date and will continue to revalue the fair value of the contingent consideration at each subsequent balance sheet date until the final settlement date, with the resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses.    The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis, measured as of  March 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

 12. Contingent Consideration
   Contingent Consideration
    The Company evaluated the NEPSI Acquisition earnout payment set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (see Note 3, "Acquisitions" for further details), which  may require settlement in the Company's common stock, and determined the contingent consideration qualified for liability classification and derivative treatment under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a result, for each period, the fair value of the contingent consideration will be remeasured and the resulting gain or loss will be recognized in operating expenses until the share amount is fixed.    The following is a summary of the key assumptions used in a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the NEPSI Acquisition:    
Fiscal Year 2021 | March 31, 2022 | | | December 31, 2021 | | | September 30, 2021 | | June 30, 2021 |

      58           On  March 27, 2020, the United States enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package that includes spending and tax breaks to strengthen the United States economy and fund a nationwide effort to curtail the effect of COVID-19. While the CARES Act provides sweeping tax changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the more significant provisions include removal of certain limitations on utilization of net operating losses, increasing the loss carryback period for certain losses to five years, and increasing the ability to deduct interest expense, as well as amending certain provisions of the previously enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The CARES Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets in the U.S. and Romania since it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realizable. After consideration of all the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that a $186.6 million valuation allowance at  March 31, 2022 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized which is a $13.5 million decrease from the $200.1 valuation allowance as of  March 31, 2021.
   At  March 31, 2022, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $755.5 million and $201.3 million, respectively, which expire in the years ending  March 31, 2023 through 2040. For U.S. federal tax purpose, approximately $86.7 million of federal net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period. Included in the U.S. net operating loss are $3.7 million of acquired losses from Power Quality Systems, Inc. and $0.3 million of acquired losses from Infinia Technology Corporation. Research and development and other tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $10.9 million and $3.2 million are available to offset federal and state income taxes, respectively, and will expire in the years ending through 2040.
   During the year ended  March 31, 2022, AMSC China was dissolved, so all deferred tax assets for AMSC China have been written off as of   March 31, 2022. The Company had established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in China as the future tax benefit was not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.      As of  January 1, 2022, AMSC Romania was reclassified as a micro enterprise and will be treated as a micro enterprise tax system. At  March 31, 2022, AMSC Romania has aggregate net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 0.9 million, which can be carried forward for seven years and begin to expire at  March 31, 2028.       Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”), provides limits on the extent to which a corporation that has undergone an ownership change (as defined) can utilize any net operating loss ("NOL") and general business tax credit carryforwards it  may have. The Company updated its study in 2020 to determine whether Section 382 could limit the use of its carryforwards in this manner. After completing this study, the Company has concluded that the limitation will not have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.  If there were material ownership changes subsequent to the study, such changes could limit the Company's ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.    The total amount of undistributed foreign earnings available to be repatriated at  March 31, 2022 was $2.7 million resulting in the recording of a $0.3 million deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.   The Company has not recorded a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference associated with the excess of the tax greater than the book basis in its Romanian subsidiary as the future tax benefit is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.   Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.  The Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions at  March 31, 2022.  The Company did not have any gross unrecognized tax benefits at  March 31, 2022 or 2021.   There were no reversals of uncertain tax positions in the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021.   The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes. Any unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect its effective tax rate in any future period. The Company does not expect that the amounts of unrecognized benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months.   The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Major tax jurisdictions include the U.S. and Austria. All U.S. income tax filings for fiscal years ended  March 31, 1996 through 2022 remain open and subject to examination.   All fiscal years from the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2020 through 2022 remain open and subject to examination in Austria. Tax filings in Romania for the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2017 through 2022 remain open and subject to examination.        59         
 14. Debt
   As part of the Neeltran Acquisition, the Company identified four equipment financing agreements that Neeltran had entered into prior to the acquisition on  May 6, 2021. The Company determined to account for these agreements as a debt transaction and recorded current and long-term debt liabilities of $0.1 million each during the twelve months ended  March 31, 2022. 
  

 15. Leases 
   The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Company defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means that the Company have both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.   The discount rate was calculated using an incremental borrowing rate based on an assessment prepared by the Company through the use of Company credit ratings, consideration of its lease populations potential risk to its total capital structure, and a market rate for a collateralized loan for its risk profile, calculated by a third party. The Company elected to apply the discount rate using the remaining lease term at the date of adoption.   Following the Neeltran Acquisition, the Company evaluated all open Neeltran contracts at the date of the acquisition to determine if any applied under ASC 842 as Neeltran, a private company, had deferred adopting ASC 842 prior to the Neeltran Acquisition, as permitted. The Company identified nine lease contracts with terms greater than twelve months and evaluated them under ASC 842 guidance. As part of the implementation, the Company identified one lease contract that classified as a financing lease. The Company does not expect a material impact to the financial statements on an ongoing basis resulting from the adoption of the ASC 842 standard for the Neeltran business and Neeltran will follow the existing policies below.   Operating Leases
   All significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement.  Operating lease right–of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company enters into a variety of operating lease agreements through the normal course of its business, but primarily real estate leases to support its operations. The real estate lease agreements generally provide for fixed minimum rental payments and the payment of real estate taxes and insurance. Many of these real estate leases have one or more renewal options that allow the Company, at its discretion, to renew the lease for varying periods up to five years or to terminate the lease. Only renewal options or termination rights that the Company believed were likely to be exercised were included in the lease calculations.   The Company also enters into leases for vehicles, IT equipment and service agreements, and other leases related to its manufacturing operations that are also included in the right-of-use assets and lease liability accounts if they are for a term of longer than twelve months. However, many of these leases are either short-term in nature or immaterial. The Company has made the policy election to exclude short-term leases from the balance sheet.    Finance﻿ Leases
   As part of the adoption of ASC 842 at Neeltran, the Company identified one lease contract that is classified as a financing lease. In  February 2020, Neeltran entered into a contract to lease a copy machine for an initial term of 39 months, or through  May 2023. The Company concluded that the lease should be classified and accounted for as a finance lease as the total value of the lease payments are greater than fair value of the asset. Accordingly, on  May 6, 2021, the Company recognized a finance lease right-of-use asset and a finance lease liability of $13.2 thousand on the Neeltran opening balance sheet. As of  March 31, 2022, the right-of-use asset related to the finance lease was $7.6 thousand, net of accumulated amortization of $5.6 thousand, and is included in the property and equipment, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.   Finance lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized similar to an operating lease, at the lease commencement date or the date the lessor makes the leased asset available for use. Finance lease right-of-use assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the carrying amount of the finance lease liabilities are (1) accreted to reflect interest using the incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, and (2) reduced to reflect lease payments made during the period. Amortization expense for finance lease right-of-use assets and interest accretion on finance lease liabilities are recorded to depreciation expense and interest expense, respectively in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.   Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases at  March 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

 16. Stockholders’ Equity
   Stock-Based Compensation Plans
   As of  March 31, 2022, the Company had two active stock plans: the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated 2007 Director Stock Plan (the “2007 Director Plan”).  On  August 1, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2007 Plan and the 2007 Director Plan. The amendment to the 2007 Plan increased the total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2007 Plan from 3,400,000 shares to 4,600,000 shares. The amendment to the 2007 Director Plan increased the total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2007 Director Plan from 230,000 shares to 280,000 shares.   The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the IRC of 1986, as amended, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. In the case of options, the exercise price is no less than the fair market value of the common stock, as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board of Directors, on the date of grant. The contractual life of options is generally 10 years. Options generally vest over a 3-5 year period while restricted stock generally vests over a 3 year period.   The 2007 Director Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock awards to members of the Board of Directors who are not also employees of the Company ("outside directors"). Under the terms of the 2007 Director Plan, each outside director is granted an option to purchase shares of common stock with an aggregate grant date value equal to $40,000 upon his or her initial election to the Board with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest in equal annual installments over a two-year period. In addition, each outside director is granted an award of shares of common stock on the third business day following the last day of each fiscal year with an aggregate value equal to $50,000 using the closing price of the Company's common stock two business days following the last day of each fiscal year, subject to proration for any partial fiscal year of service.   As of  March 31, 2022, the 2007 Plan had 268,523 shares available for future issuance and the 2007 Director Plan had 72,841 shares available for future issuance.   Stock-Based Compensation

There were 255,000 performance-based restricted shares awarded during the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021 for which the performance conditions are deemed probable to be met and the expense is being recorded over the expected vesting period.   The remaining shares awarded vest upon the passage of time. For awards that vest upon the passage of time, expense is being recorded over the vesting period.   Employee Stock Purchase Plan
   The Company maintains the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the "ESPP") which provides employees with the opportunity to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to the market value of the common stock at the end of the offering period, less a 15% purchase discount. As of  March 31, 2022, the ESPP had 159,822 shares available for future issuance. The Company recognized less than $0.1 million of compensation expense for both the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, related to the ESPP.      62          17. Commitments and Contingencies
   Purchase Commitments
   The Company periodically enters into non-cancelable purchase contracts in order to ensure the availability of materials to support production of its products. Purchase commitments represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. The Company periodically assesses the need to provide for impairment on these purchase contracts and records a loss on purchase commitments when required.   Lease Commitments
   During the year ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021 all leases were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.  See Note 15, "Leases" for further details.     Legal Contingencies
   From time to time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.   Other
   The Company enters into long-term construction contracts with customers that require the Company to obtain performance bonds. The Company is required to deposit an amount equivalent to some or all the face amount of the performance bonds into an escrow account until the termination of the bond. When the performance conditions are met, amounts deposited as collateral for the performance bonds are returned to the Company. In addition, the Company has various contractual arrangements in which minimum quantities of goods or services have been committed to be purchased on an annual basis.   As of  March 31, 2022, the Company had $6.1 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and $2.8 million of restricted cash in current assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent deposits to secure letters of credit for various supply contracts or collateral deposits including the irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $5.0 million to secure certain of the Company’s obligations under the Subcontract Agreement with Commonwealth Edison Company. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts.

 18. Employee Benefit Plans
   The Company has implemented a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”) under Section 401(k) of the IRC. Any contributions made by the Company to the Plan are discretionary. The Company has a stock match program under which the Company matched, in the form of Company common stock, 50% of the first 6% of eligible contributions. The Company recorded expense of $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2022, and $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2021, and recorded corresponding charges to additional paid-in capital related to this program.  19. Business Segments 
   The Company reports its financial results in two reportable business segments: Grid and Wind.  In accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, we aggregate three operating segments into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes due to their similar operating and financial characteristics.  Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources.   Through the Company’s power grid offerings, the Grid business segment enables electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute smarter, cleaner and better power through its transmission planning services, power electronics, and superconductor-based systems. The sales process is enabled by transmission planning services that allow it to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality and other risks, which helps the Company determine how its solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems, and transmission and distribution cable systems.  The Company also sells ship protection products to the U.S. Navy through its Grid business segment.   Through the Company’s wind power offerings, the Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through its advanced power electronics and control system products, engineered designs, and support services. The Company supplies advanced power electronics and control systems, licenses its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provides extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company’s design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 2 megawatts ("MWs") and higher. The Company provides a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.   The operating results for the two business segments are as follows (in thousands):    
 | Fiscal Years Ended March 31, |

 | 2022 | | 2021 | 
Revenues: | | | | | 
Grid | $ | 98,876 | | $ | 70,528

Unallocated corporate expenses | | 1,190 | | | | (6,545 | )
Total | $ | (21,089 | ) | | $ | (23,165 | )

    Total assets for the two business segments as of  March 31, 2022 and  March 31, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):    
 | March 31, 2022 | | March 31, 2021 |

Corporate assets | | 49,968 | | | 81,515 
Total | $ | 173,887 | | $ | 168,866

    The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company’s business segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues and segment operating loss. The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which Company management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. In addition, certain corporate expenses which the Company does not believe are specifically attributable or allocable to either of the two business segments have been excluded from the segment operating loss.     64        Unallocated corporate expenses primarily consist of a gain on contingent consideration of $5.9 million offset by stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million, in the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2022. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily consist of loss on contingent consideration of $3.0 million and stock-based compensation of $3.5 million in the year ended  March 31, 2021.

 20. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
   In  June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.  Following the release of ASU 2019-10 in  November 2019, the new effective date, as long as the Company remains a smaller reporting company, would be annual reporting periods beginning after  December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2016-13  may have on its consolidated financial statements.   In  December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 provide for simplified accounting to several income tax situations and removal of certain accounting exceptions. As of  April 1, 2021, the Company has adopted ASU 2019-12 and noted no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   In  October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.
