Item 1. Business
Overview
Origin Materials, Inc. ("Origin") is a carbon negative materials company with a mission to help enable the world’s transition to sustainable materials by replacing petroleum-based materials with decarbonized materials in a wide range of end products, such as food and beverage packaging, clothing, textiles, plastics, car parts, carpeting, tires, adhesives, soil amendments and more. We believe that our platform technology can help make the world’s transition to “net zero” possible and support the fulfillment of greenhouse gas reduction pledges made by countries as part of the United Nations Paris Agreement as well as corporations that are committed to reducing emissions in their supply chains.
Our technology can convert sustainable feedstocks such as sustainably harvested wood residues, agricultural waste, wood waste and even corrugated cardboard into materials and products that are currently made from fossil feedstocks such as petroleum and natural gas. These sustainable feedstocks are not used in food production, which differentiates our technology from other sustainable materials companies that use feedstocks such as vegetable oils or high fructose corn syrup and other sugars.
We believe that products made using Origin's platform technology can compete directly with petroleum-derived products on both performance and price. Due to abundant and renewable wood supplies that have historically stable pricing, our cost of production is expected to be more stable than potential competing platforms that use other types of feedstocks. We believe that end products made using our platform technology will have a significant unit cost advantage over products made from other low carbon feedstocks.
Our platform technology converts biomass-plant-based carbon into “building block” chemicals that can be converted into both “drop-in” materials and new materials with differentiated functional performance. The “drop-in” products are chemically fungible with those produced from petroleum-based raw materials, and therefore these “drop-in” products can be fed into existing supply chains without modification to the equipment or production processes of our customers.
Origin's capability to produce carbon negative materials at is protected by an intellectual property portfolio comprised of 19 patent families as well as trade secrets covering non-discoverable aspects of Origin's critical manufacturing processes.
We have developed strong partnerships with large, brand-name corporations determined to transition to sustainable materials to help meet their emissions reduction goals. For example, in 2017, we founded the “NaturALL Bottle Alliance” with Danone and Nestlé Waters, with PepsiCo joining in 2018, to accelerate the development of innovative packaging solutions made with 100% sustainable and renewable resources. Each member of the NaturALL Bottle Alliance has agreed to assist in establishing a supply chain for the production of the sustainable materials being developed by the NaturALL Bottle Alliance. Each member has also agreed to provide technical equipment, resources, know-how and scientific skills necessary for the performance of the NaturALL Bottle Alliance’s research and development program, and to be responsible for its own expenses. The members’ offtake agreements with us provide additional financial support for the research and development program and the commercialization of sustainable materials under development by the NaturALL Bottle Alliance. In addition to being customers, Danone, Nestlé and PepsiCo are also investors in Origin.
Our vision for the future is the replacement of fossil-based feedstocks and materials with non-food, plant-based feedstocks and materials, while capturing carbon in the process. Our decarbonizing platform technology potentially addresses an estimated $1.0 trillion dollar market opportunity, and we believe it can help revolutionize the production of a wide range of end products.
Our Platform Technology
We have developed a proprietary platform technology to convert biomass, or plant-based carbon, into the versatile “building block” chemicals chloromethylfurfural (“CMF”) and hydrothermal carbon (“HTC”), which we collectively refer to as Furanic Intermediates, as well as other minor products. At commercial scale, our platform technology is expected to produce CMF and HTC with a negative carbon footprint. We believe these chemicals can replace petroleum-based inputs, lowering the carbon footprint of a wide range of materials without increasing cost or sacrificing performance.
CMF. CMF is a chemically flexible intermediate that can be converted into a variety of products, including paraxylene (“PX”), that can “drop in” to current supply chains to produce purified terephthalic acid (“PTA”), and 
subsequently polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), or polyethylene furanoate (“PEF”). CMF and its derivatives can be used to produce numerous commodity and specialty chemicals. We have developed products made from CMF that can be used in applications such as food and beverage packaging and apparel and carpet fibers, and our product development pipeline includes applications such as adhesives, coatings and plasticizers.
HTC. HTC is a diverse, high-potential carbon-negative material. Current applications of our HTC include a drop-in, energy-dense solid fuel. HTC can also be calcined to produce a carbon-negative activated carbon for food and water treatment and filtration. Our HTC product development pipeline includes carbon black replacement for tires, foams and dyes, paint and coating applications, and agriculture and soil products. Notably, our carbon black has no detectable carcinogenic compounds, known as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, found in carbon black produced from fossil feedstocks.
Our manufacturing process to produce CMF and HTC consists of front end feedstock handling, and subsequent liquid phase reaction with our catalyst mixture, followed by downstream separation processes to separate and purify CMF, HTC and other co-products, as described in the following diagram.
Market Opportunity
Global Decarbonization Commitments
We believe that increasing consumer awareness and growing governmental initiatives are driving a shift in the global community towards decarbonized materials. The UN Paris Agreement of 2015, joined by 190 countries to date, includes commitments to limit the global average temperature increase by 2100 to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this target, the UN estimated in 2019 that annual carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions must be 15 gigatons lower than current nationally determined contributions imply.
According to a 2019 Ellen MacArthur Foundation study, approximately 45% of global CO2 emissions are associated with manufacturing products, including the production of materials and chemicals from which those products are made. According to a 2019 Barclays estimate, the chemicals market consumes 10.6 million barrels of oil per day, releasing massive quantities of new carbon into the atmosphere in the process. Our vision for the future is to replace fossil-based feedstocks and materials with sustainably harvested wood and other non-food, sustainable feedstocks. As a tree grows, it consumes existing CO2 from the atmosphere, and when it dies and decays, that CO2 is released back into the atmosphere. However, through our proprietary manufacturing process, we convert the wood into manufacturing and feedstock materials, thereby capturing that CO2.
Many companies have already pledged to achieve net zero carbon targets, with some aiming to achieve that target within the next decade. Despite the progress in the shift to renewable energy generation and electric vehicles, we believe that reducing emissions from energy use alone is insufficient to achieve the goals and commitments established by companies and governments. Consequently, in the near-term, we believe that these companies will need to integrate decarbonized materials into their supply chains.
The graphic below highlights some of the notable companies that have made public commitments to decarbonization and their respective decarbonization targets:

Our Addressable Market
According to the International Energy Agency, the chemical sector is the largest industrial consumer of both oil and gas. Currently, organic chemicals are predominantly derived from fossil sources such as petroleum. These chemicals are used to produce a wide array of materials from paints to plastics, space suits to solar panels, and from medicines to electronics. According to a 2019 Barclays estimate, more than 10 million barrels of oil are consumed daily to create these materials, releasing massive quantities of new carbon into the atmosphere in the process. According to a 2018 report by The Association of Plastic Recyclers, for example, every kilogram of virgin fossil-PET has a life cycle global warming potential of 2.78 kilograms of carbon emissions. Our platform technology will enable companies to lower their overall CO2 emissions and meet their emissions reduction commitments by substituting decarbonizing Furanic Intermediates and their derivatives for all or a portion of the fossil-based content of materials like PET in their supply chains.

Our platform technology can produce carbon-negative and low carbon replacements for chemicals that have many potential applications. Our platform technology is expected to address some of these applications as soon as its initial production capacity is online, and to address other potential applications over time. Origin's near-term and long-term addressable markets together exceed $1 trillion. 
$390+ billion near-term market focus. We believe our technology can serve near-term markets representing an aggregate market opportunity that we believe is over $390 billion when Origin 2 and Origin 3 open. These markets include polyesters for textiles, PET resin for packaging, solid fuels, activated carbon and carbon black for tires and polymer fillers. We expect the Origin 2 plant to be operational in mid-2025 and the Origin 3 plant to be operational in 2027.
$750+ billion long-term market focus. Our platform technology produces versatile chemical “building blocks” that we anticipate, in the long term, can be converted into products to replace a broad range of chemicals and materials representing an addressable market that we believe is more than $750 billion. These markets include paints, coatings, soil additives, advanced polyesters, epoxies, plasticizers, polyurethanes, elastomers, emulsions and solvents.
Competitive Landscape
We expect our products to compete with traditional, petroleum-based materials currently used in Origin's target markets, as well as compete with alternatives to these materials that both established and new companies seek to produce.
In our near-term markets, we expect to compete with established producers of PET fibers and resins, activated carbon and carbon black. Producers of these materials include global oil and petrochemical companies and large international diversified chemical companies. Several of these producers are seeking to develop materials from renewable sources that could compete with our products. Moreover, a number of established companies and new entrants have announced intentions to develop renewable alternatives for existing chemical products used in our near-term focus markets.
In addition to competition from producers of petroleum-based materials and renewable alternatives, we expect to face competition from recycled materials such as recycled PET (“rPET”) in certain applications in our near-term focus markets. We do not believe that recycled materials will achieve the required scale and penetration to impact the market demand for our products before 2030 because recycling streams are significantly supply-constrained. We believe that improving the supply constraint for recycling will require substantial investments in infrastructure and fundamental changes to the existing entrenched governmental and institutional recycling systems and customer behavior and habits. Additionally, unless there are major changes to current technology and infrastructure, we believe that it will be difficult to implement 100% rPET material sourcing for many applications.
In our long-term focus markets, we expect to face competition from, among others, incumbents that include large chemical companies that continue to rely on petroleum-based feedstocks in their production processes.
Given our leading position in decarbonized materials, we also expect to compete with alternative technologies targeting different sources of emissions. These competitors include electric vehicles, renewable power generation, and food technology. While we do not anticipate competing directly for market share with producers of these technologies, we expect to compete for wallet share from customers looking to reduce overall carbon emissions throughout their supply chain and operations. In the long-term, once adoption of various technologies has increased and customers no longer have to prioritize different methods of reducing overall carbon emission, we expect only to compete against other materials producers.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our platform technology can replace petroleum as the foundational feedstock for the materials economy. Our competitive strengths include:
•Flexible platform enables drop-in solutions serving a large addressable market. We believe that our platform technology is well-positioned to address a substantial global market that is just beginning to transition from petroleum-based materials to sustainable materials. Many of our products are drop-in replacements for traditional petrochemicals, enabling our customers to use our products in their existing manufacturing processes to produce chemically and physically identical end products with little to no change in customer behavior.
•Abundant, low-cost and historically price-stable feedstock. Our platform technology can use timber and forest residues such as pine pulpwood, which is currently abundant and renewable, as its base-case feedstock. The feedstock for the pulp industry in North America is plentiful and the cost has historically been relatively low and stable, varying – according to the NC State University Extension Quarterly Price Report – from between $9.29 and $10.11 per ton between Q1 2015 and Q4 2020. The market for these feedstocks tends to be local due to relatively high transport costs, and therefore is insulated from typical commodity price volatility. Furthermore, our pulpwood feedstock does not compete for use as a food source, insulating our products from demand price pressures faced by other agricultural-based renewable feedstocks such as corn and sugarcane.
•Unit Economics. Our proprietary platform technology converts low-cost renewable feedstock into flexible chemical intermediates in a single catalytic reaction.
•Carbon Footprint. We believe our products can help enable prospective customers to achieve their net zero carbon emissions commitments by transitioning away from fossil-based materials towards materials made with our platform technology, which uses sustainable, non-food, plant-based feedstock. We estimate that a single commercial-scale Origin plant producing CMF and HTC can eliminate or avoid more than 1.3 million tons of emitted carbon dioxide annually.
•High Barriers to Entry. Over more than a decade, we have generated a robust patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets. We believe our competitors now significantly lag behind us and will be unable to replicate the efficiency, yield and quality of our process, as we expect to continue to improve our existing technology and processes.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to build a commercially successful business that can scale and meet current and future expected demand for carbon negative materials. We plan to construct plants that can produce materials at a commercial scale and expect to continue to develop new products and applications, together with our platform partners, to maintain and increase its competitive advantage.
Key elements of our strategy include:
Complete construction of Origin 1 and launch construction of Origin 2:
•We are undertaking two significant initial capital projects: “Origin 1” and “Origin 2”. Our strategic intent for Origin 1 is to serve and develop longer term focus markets that require our customers to reformulate existing products and applications. At scale, Origin 2 is intended to focus on supplying products that serve our near-term markets of interest.
•Origin 1, our initial plant, is under construction in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. As of December 31, 2021, we completed installation of most foundations for building and process areas at the construction site. As of December 31, 2021, we had also completed installation of the key production modules containing equipment used for the conversion of biomass feedstock into high value chemicals. We expect that interconnecting piping will be installed, all electrical work will be complete, and utilities and raw material handling equipment will be installed during 2022. We expect that construction of Origin 1 will be mechanically complete before the end of 2022, with commissioning and production at the plant beginning in 2023.
•As of December 31, 2021, Origin 2 is in the project development stage. During the first quarter of 2022, we announced the completion of certain milestones, such as owner's engineer selection and, subject to finalization of economic incentives, site selection. We expect the front-end engineering design package completed and construction and fabrication started by the middle of 2023. We expect that the construction of Origin 2 will be complete, and the plant operational in 2025.
Sell-out contracted capacity in future plants years ahead of mechanical completion:
•As of February 24, 2022, we had announced $5.6 billion in customer demand from customers in a diverse mix of industries, which demand is expected to be fulfilled by production from Origin 1, Origin 2, Origin 3 and Origin 4. These customers include Global Fortune 500 companies with long-term commitments to decarbonizing their supply chain and operations. We expect continued expanding demand from potential new customers and to continue contracting for new high margin products, including PEF. Because we believe that demand for our products will outpace supply for the foreseeable future, we expect that we will 
need to identify and prioritize sales to customers for applications that command the highest margins. Please see the section titled “Offtake Agreements” for additional information regarding our offtake agreements.
Expand and develop new partnerships across the value chain:
•Our strategy includes, among other things, working with upstream partners to identify suitable aging/defunct pulp mills, convert key equipment components, and integrate those components into a refurbished and repurposed chemical plant. We expect this to enable us to partner with the existing forest products supply chains and government entities concerned with forest management and potential local labor and economic benefits associated with repurposing the pulp mills. We plan to engage procurement and construction companies and enter into joint ventures for production, which would provide us with best-in-class capabilities to efficiently construct our plants. In addition, we expect to collaborate with partners who have the market knowledge and expertise to design compelling products and penetrate new markets. We believe that helping these partners build profitable new businesses and product lines using our cost-advantaged chemical intermediate platform enhances the value of our platform and promotes long-term committed customer relationships for an expanding and diversifying set of markets. We also intend to continue creating industry collaborations like the NaturALL Bottle Alliance and like our partner and customer relationships with Kolon Industries, Drive+, Alliance to End Plastic Waste, Ford Motor Company, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, PrimaLoft, Solvay, and others, to commercialize decarbonizing solutions with the help of end users and brands. We intend to continue using demand from industry-leading brands to motivate and align the intermediate supply chain to meet carbon reduction commitments.
Continue development of next-gen materials and applications:
•Our strategy is to develop low and negative carbon materials for use in a variety of products, including textiles and fabrics, next generation packaging, paints, coatings, and epoxies, fillers for tires and other rubber products, fuels, and agricultural products.
•Our CMF near-term (2022-2025+) product focus is on low or negative carbon PET. In the medium term (2025-2027+), we will focus on improving PET polyester with the incorporation of furanic content to make “PETF” blended products, and in the longer term (2027+), we expect to focus on producing next generation high-performance polyesters with strong gas barrier and high heat resistance that can be fully recyclable with current technologies.
•Our HTC near-term (2022-2025+) product focus is on “drop-in” energy-dense solid fuels. In the medium term (2025-2027+), we will focus on carbon negative carcinogen-free carbon black replacement for tires and other rubber and polymer filled materials. In the longer term (2027+), we expect to focus on next generation agricultural products such as slow-release fertilizers as well as microbial and biologics delivery.
Develop new revenue streams through technology licensing:
•We have developed technologies to convert CMF and HTC into a variety of valuable end products, and expect to continue to develop these technologies. We expect, over time, to license this technology to relevant manufacturers of those end products while we supply the CMF and HTC to the licensees.
Our Products
The majority of our product output is comprised of versatile Furanic Intermediates. Depending on the specific feedstock, we may also produce several minority co-products, including levulinic acid, furfural, and various extractives.
CMF—chloromethylfurfural:
•CMF is an organic compound derived directly from cellulosic biomass through our patented process, consisting of furan substituted at the 2 and 5 positions with a formyl group and chloromethyl group. CMF is easily derivatized into multiple products including those for polyesters, nylons, epoxies, surfactants, and several others. At full commercial scale, our process is expected to be able to produce CMF with a carbon impact of –1.21 kg CO2 equivalent/kg CMF, according to a life cycle analysis by Deloitte SAS.
HTC—hydrothermal carbon:
•HTC is a carbonaceous composite consisting of furanic resin and lignin fragments. It is derived from ligno-cellulose through our patented process, and is a structured composite resin comprising furanic chemical groups that can be further functionalized or de-functionalized while retaining nano-scale morphology of the HTC. Via functionalization or de-functionalization, HTC may be further derivatized into products such as carbon black, activated carbon, as well as a variety of agricultural products. At full commercial scale, our process is expected to be able to produce HTC with a carbon impact of –1.67 kg CO2 equivalent/kg HTC, according to a life cycle analysis by Deloitte SAS.
Customers
We believe that our platform technology ideally positions Origin to address industry demand for carbon-negative and low-carbon materials. As of February 24, 2022, we had announced approximately $5.6 billion in contracted offtake agreements (including customer options, which may or may not be exercised) and capacity reservations. These agreements have terms ranging from 5-10 years and encompass production from one or more of Origin 1, Origin 2, Origin 3 and Origin 4. Our customers include Global Fortune 500 companies including Ford Motor Company and fellow NaturALL Bottle Alliance members Danone, Nestlé Waters, and PepsiCo, as well as Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Packaging Equity Holdings, Kolon Industries, PrimaLoft, Solvay, Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Minafin Group, and others.
Raw Materials Supply
Our platform technology can produce building block chemicals from a variety of abundant, low-cost bio-feedstocks including wood residues and wood processing waste. Our process was designed to be able to take advantage of idled and aging pulp mills and may be co-located with such mills to secure access to existing site-specific feedstock supplies and skilled labor while lowering required capital investment. We believe we will be able to contract for the necessary quantity and quality of these or suitable alternative feedstocks needed to manufacture products. We expect our demand for wood residues and wood processing waste in 2030 represents less than 1% of the world’s total supply of these feedstocks and less than 0.5% of the global supply of suitable alternative feedstocks that can be used in our process, such as agricultural wastes, mixed paper waste, and construction wastes.
Offtake Agreements
Nestlé Waters Offtake Agreement
In November 2016, we entered into an offtake agreement with Nestlé Waters. The agreement had a 5-year term to purchase a specified amount of product per year from the Origin 1 facility. The agreement required us to meet certain construction and product delivery milestones by specified dates and requires us to pay liquidated damages if the milestones were not achieved. For Origin 1, these milestones have been deferred to March 31, 2022 in order to facilitate the negotiation of an amendment to the agreement, including the milestone achievement dates. As of the date hereof, the negotiation is ongoing.
In addition to the above provisions, Nestlé may terminate the offtake agreement if: (i) we fail to meet agreed upon quality or quantity requirements; (ii) a force majeure continues for an extended period; (iii) any of certain designated parties directly acquires an equity interest in us; (iv) we fail to comply with mutually agreed sustainability principles; (v) either party takes steps to enter into liquidation or is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or enters into a deed of arrangement for the benefit of its creditors; or (vi) a bankruptcy event occurs with respect to a third party manufacturer that is critical to our supply chain, and we are unable to retain a substitute. If Nestlé terminates the offtake agreements, certain outstanding advance payments made to us by Nestlé and evidenced by a secured promissory note, as described below, become immediately due. In addition, upon any material breach of the offtake agreement by us, we have a specified amount of time, subject to modification by agreement with Nestlé, to cure the breach before Nestlé may terminate the agreement.
In November 2016, we received a $5.0 million prepayment from Nestlé Waters for product from Origin 1 pursuant to the offtake agreement. The prepayment will be credited against the purchase of products from Origin 1 over the term of the offtake agreement. Specifically, the prepayment will be repaid by applying a credit to product purchases each month over the operation of Origin 1 until a total of $7.5 million of credits have been applied. The prepayment is evidenced by a secured note that will be repaid in cash in the event the prepayment cannot be credited against the purchase of product because, for example, Origin 1 is never constructed. If repaid in cash, the note bears an annual interest rate of the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.25% (0.38% at December 31, 2021) and matures five years from the commercial operation date of Origin 1. Our outstanding obligation, together with accrued interest, under Nestlé Waters’ promissory note totaled an aggregate of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2021.
Danone Offtake Agreement
In November 2016, we entered into an offtake agreement with Danone. The agreement has a 5-year term to purchase a specified amount of product per year from the Origin 1 facility. The agreement also includes an option exercisable by Danone to enter into an additional offtake agreement to purchase product from Origin 2 for a term of up to 10 years. This option has not yet been exercised. The agreement requires us to meet certain construction and product delivery milestones by specified dates and requires us to pay liquidated damages if the milestones are not achieved. For Origin 1, these milestones have been deferred to June 30, 2022 in order to facilitate the negotiation of an amendment to the agreement, including the milestone achievement dates. As of the date hereof, the negotiation is ongoing.
In addition to the above provisions, Danone may terminate the offtake agreement if: (i) we fail to meet the agreed upon quality or quantity requirements; (ii) a force majeure event continues for an extended period; (iii) any of certain designated parties directly acquires an equity interest in us; (iv) we fail to comply with mutually agreed sustainability principles; (v) the NaturALL Bottle Alliance agreement is terminated; (vi) a material adverse change has occurred prior to the first order placed under the agreement; (vii) either party takes steps to enter into liquidation, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings or a bankruptcy event occurs with respect to either party, or a third party manufacturer that is critical to our supply chain, and we are unable to retain a substitute; or (viii) an event of default as defined by in Danone’s promissory note occurs. 
In November 2016, we received a $5.0 million prepayment from Danone for product from Origin 1 pursuant to the offtake agreement with Danone. The prepayment was to be credited against the purchase of products from Origin 1 over the term of the offtake agreement. The prepayment is evidenced by a secured note. In May 17, 2019, the Danone offtake agreement and secured note were amended to make Danone's prepayment repayable in three fixed cash installments, inclusive of interest. If Danone terminates the offtake agreement, the note becomes due immediately. Our outstanding obligation, together with accrued interest, under Danone’s promissory note totaled an aggregate of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, upon any material breach of the offtake agreement by us, we have a specified amount of time, subject to modification by agreement with Danone, to cure the breach before Danone may terminate the agreement.
Pepsi Offtake Agreement
In August 2018, we entered into an offtake agreement with Pepsi. The agreement has a 5-year term to purchase a specified amount of product per year from the Origin 1 facility, and an additional 5-year term to purchase a specified amount of product per year from Origin 2. Pepsi may terminate the agreement if commercial operation or delivery of product from Origin 1 has not occurred by December 31, 2022. Pepsi also may terminate the agreement if commercial operation of Origin 2 has not occurred by June 30, 2025, or if product from Origin 2 has not been delivered before September 30, 2025.
In addition to the above provisions, Pepsi may terminate the offtake agreement if: (i) we fail to meet agreed upon quality or quantity requirements; (ii) a force majeure event continues for an extended period; or (iii) a bankruptcy event occurs with respect to either party, or a third party manufacturer that is critical to our supply chain, and we are unable to retain a substitute. Also, upon our material breach of the offtake agreement, we have a specified amount of time, subject to modification by agreement with Pepsi, to cure the breach before Pepsi may terminate the agreement.
Packaging Matters Offtake Agreement
In December 2020, we entered into an offtake agreement with Packaging Matters, LLC (formerly known as Packaging Equity Holdings, LLC) (“Packaging Matters”). This agreement has a 10-year term and provides for the purchase of specified volumes of product per year from each of our first four plants, Origin 1 through Origin 4. Packaging Matters may terminate the agreement if we deliver notice to Packaging Matters that we have determined that it is reasonably likely that we will not fulfill certain conditions precedent to start-up of the Origin 1 facility by January 1, 2025.
In addition to the above provisions, either party may terminate the offtake agreement if a force majeure event continues for an extended period or if a bankruptcy event occurs with respect to the other party. Upon our material breach of the offtake agreement, we have a specified amount of time, subject to modification by agreement with Packaging Matters, to cure the breach before Packaging Matters may terminate the agreement.
Research and Development
Our strategy depends upon both continued improvement of our platform technology and development of new chemical pathways, next-generation materials and product applications, and our research and development efforts are focused on supporting these two objectives. We operate an in-house laboratory and pilot-scale manufacturing facilities in 
West Sacramento, California and Sarnia, Ontario, Canada to conduct research and development work. In addition, we conduct joint research and development work with third parties including academic institutions, vendors, and other partners such as members of the NaturALL Bottle Alliance.
Intellectual Property
Our patent portfolio is comprised of 19 patent families focused on the conversion of biomass to CMF and HTC. Origin intends to retain exclusive rights to commercially work its biomass to CMF and HTC pathways.
Patents. Our core technology—biomass to CMF and HTC—is protected with patents, trade secrets, and know-how. We have 25 patents directed to CMF. One U.S. and one Korean composition of matter patent expiring in 2034 are directed to crystalline forms of CMF. Fourteen patents are directed to compositions of and methods for preparing CMF. These include three in the United States, two in Korea, two in Malaysia, and one each in Brazil, China, India, and Mexico, which expire in 2032, as well as two patents in the United States and one in Brazil that expire in 2034. Nine patents are directed to methods and systems for purifying CMF. These include one patent in the United States and one in China, each expiring in 2033, and three patents in the United States and one each in Brazil, China, South Korea, and Europe that expire in 2034. We have seven pending applications directed to compositions and methods for preparing CMF. These include one in the United States that would expire in 2034, two in Malaysia that would expire in 2034, one in Malaysia that would expire in 2032, two in China that would expire in 2034, and one in Europe that would expire in 2034.
We also have eight patents directed to methods for preparing PX and terephthalic acid (PTA when purified). These include two patents in the United States and one each in China and Japan that expire in 2032, as well as three patents in the United States and one in Japan that expire in 2033.
We have five patents directed to dimethylfuran (“DMF”), a derivative of CMF, including three patents in the United States expiring in 2034 directed to methods of producing DMF and two patents in the United States expiring in 2035 directed to compositions of and methods for preparing DMF. We also have two pending patent applications directed to DMF. These include one each in Thailand and Europe that would expire in 2035.
We have two pending patent applications directed to furandicarboxylate-polymer compositions, including PEF, and methods for producing such compositions. These include one pending application in China that would expire 2036 and one pending application in the United States that would expire in 2037.
In addition, we have five patents directed to polyhydroxylalkanoate (“PHA”), a biodegradable plastic. These include one composition of matter patent in the United States and one in Malaysia, each expiring in 2031, that are directed to bacterial strains for producing PHA, two patents in the United States, and one in Malaysia expiring in 2033 directed to compositions and methods for converting PHA into PHA derivatives.
We have three patents directed to other derivatives of CMF. These include two U.S. patents expiring in 2035 and 2036, respectively, directed to methods of preparing chemical derivatives from CMF, and one U.S. patent expiring in 2035 directed to compositions for preparing CMF derivatives.
Finally, we have one pending patent application in the United States that would expire in 2036 and is directed to compositions and resins of activated carbon and methods for producing these.
Trade secrets. We maintain a secure digital vault of our trade secrets with heightened confidentiality protections. Access to this vault is limited to a select group and is granted on a need-to-know basis. Further, the information in the vault is left strategically incomplete and requires corroboration from referenced internal documents to ensure that the entirety of any trade secret is known only by someone who has access to each such document. Our employees are required to participate in invention assignment and non-disclosure protocols to further ensure the protection of our trade secrets.
Know-how. An important aspect of our intellectual property, in addition to our patent portfolio and trade-secrets, is the depth of understanding and proficiency we gained in the behavior of the Origin technology platform's chemical reactions, the handling of feedstocks, and the process-ability of feedstocks given certain conditions. This know-how into our process and materials is carefully captured in many ways, such as by being photographed, videoed, measured, quantified, summarized, compared, and otherwise described. Within this information set, we have identified many key insights without which we believe a would-be competitor could not successfully operate in our industry or replicate our results.
Regulatory
Regulation by government authorities in the United States, Canada and other countries is a significant factor in the production and sale of our products and our ongoing research and development activities. The chemicals and intermediates that we manufacture and use, including CMF and HTC, require (or as the products are further commercialized are anticipated to require) authorization or exemptions under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) administered by Health Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the European Union’s regulation entitled the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Our production processes are subject to regulations and permit requirements relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste generation and disposal and other environmental matters. Additionally, some applications will involve food contact and will be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA).
Chemical control regulations applicable to us, such as TSCA, CEPA or REACH, impose restrictions with respect to the permitted volumes of, or the sites at which, certain chemicals manufactured or used by us may be manufactured, imported, transported and/or released into the environment. For example, in the United States, the manufacture of CMF as a chemical intermediate currently is restricted to a quantity of 15,000 kilograms per year and the volume of a substance that may be used in some subsequent conversions of CMF is subject to import restrictions in Canada. In addition, the import into Canada of a certain polymer associated with the manufacture of CMF and HTC is limited to not more than 1,000 kilograms per year prior to submitting a New Substance Notification. Compliance with these regulations is complex and could require significant capital and/or operating expenses, and failure to comply with any of these regulations can have significant consequences. Our regulatory focus has been on seeking the removal or relaxation of certain restrictions to enable scaled up production. We have filed or will be filing notifications under TSCA and CEPA seeking to remove these restrictions, as necessary, and are working to identify alternatives that are not similarly restricted in the location where they are used.

Finally, we have recently hired our first-ever VP, Human Resources to further strengthen our DE&I leadership and develop our program into 2023 and beyond.
Human Capital. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 80 employees located in the United States and 6 employees in Canada, all of whom were full-time employees.

Our ability to attract, retain and motivate exceptional employees is vital to our long-term competitive advantage. As such, our compensation practices, including long-term equity incentive plans, are designed to drive sustainable performance and align employee incentives with shareholder values.
Supporting Our Employees through COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have established and enforced comprehensive policies in the areas of Infectious Disease Control and COVID-19 Vaccinations. Currently, our employees are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or receive a vaccination exemption and adhere to strict COVID-19 protocols when on-site at our locations. Our vaccinated employees, when on-site at our locations, are also required to adhere to rigorous guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. These guidelines are designed to meet or exceed those set by local, state, and federal authorities that are applicable to our employees and sites. In addition, we have established and expanded remote working arrangements and tools across our organization in an effort to reduce the threat of a COVID-19 outbreak. Our COVID-19 Task Force, composed of staff and management employees across all departments, meets regularly to evaluate our policies and guidelines.
