ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
GrowGeneration Corp. (together with all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively “GrowGeneration” or the “Company”), incorporated in Colorado in 2014, is the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers in North America and is a leading marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, vertical benching, environmental control systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. GrowGeneration owns and operates specialty retail hydroponic and organic gardening stores. Currently, GrowGeneration has 63 stores, which include 23 locations in California, 8 locations in Colorado, 7 locations in Michigan, 5 locations in Maine, 5 locations in Oklahoma, 4 locations in Oregon, 3 locations in Washington, 2 locations in Nevada, 1 location in Arizona, 1 location in Rhode Island,1 location in Florida, 1 location in Massachusetts and 1 location in New Mexico. GrowGeneration also operates an online superstore for cultivators at growgeneration.com. GrowGeneration carries and sells thousands of products, including organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting and state of the art hydroponic equipment to be used indoors and outdoors by commercial and home growers. 
Our plan is to continue to acquire, open and operate hydroponic/gardening stores and related businesses throughout North America.
Markets 
GrowGeneration sells thousands of products, including nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems, vertical benching and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products, that are designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants. Hydroponics is a 
specialized method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent, as opposed to soil. This method is typically used for indoor cultivation to give growers the ability to better regulate and control nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests, and temperature. Hydroponic growers benefit from these techniques by producing crops faster and with higher crop yields per acre as compared to traditional soil-based growers. Indoor growing techniques and hydroponic products are being utilized in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables also utilize hydroponics due to a rising shortage of farmland as well as environmental vulnerabilities, including drought, other severe weather conditions and pests.
GrowGeneration serves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops, including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality, regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.
Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) is a technology-based approach to maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of the crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building. Plants are often grown using hydroponic methods in order to supply the proper amounts of water and nutrients to the root zone. CEA optimizes the use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital and labor. Different techniques are available for growing in controlled environment agriculture. The more viable option is vertical farming. Vertical farming has the ability to produce crops all year round in a controlled environment, with the possibility of increased yield by adjusting the amount of carbon and nutrients the plants receive.
Our target customer segments include the commercial growers in the plant-based medicine market, the craft grower and vertical farms who grow organically grown herbs and leafy green vegetables. The landscape for hydroponic retail stores is very fragmented, with numerous single stores which we consider “targets” for our acquisition strategy. Further, the products we sell are in demand due to the ever-increasing legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis and hemp, and the increasing number of licensed cultivation facilities in North America. Total sales for the hydroponic equipment industry are projected to surpass $16 billion by 2025. The Company believes there are over 15,000 active cannabis cultivation licenses in North America. The average cultivation facility is approximately 36,000 sq. ft. and over 34,000,000 pounds of cannabis is projected to be cultivated by 2025.
Our retail operations are driven by a wide selection of all hydroponic products, service and solutions driven staff and pick, pack and ship distribution and fulfillment capabilities. We employ approximately 702 employees, a majority of them we have branded as “Grow Pros”. Currently, our operations span over 895,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space.
We operate our business through the following business units:
•Retail: 62 hydroponic/gardening centers focused on serving growers and cultivators. Inclusive of commercial sales organizations selling directly to customers outside of the physical retail network. Some of our garden centers have multi-functions, with added capabilities that include warehousing, distribution and fulfillment for direct shipments of products to garden center locations, pick, pack and ship for our online platforms and direct fulfillment to our commercial customers.
•E-Commerce/Omni-channel: Our e-commerce operation includes GrowGeneration.com a business-to-business (B2B) online portal for commercial growers.
•Proprietary Brands and Private Label: We have developed a line of private label products that we are selling through our garden centers under proprietary brands we own and trademark. Our strategy is to deliver a one-stop shopping experience, through selection, service and solutions for our customers.
Retail 
Core to our growth strategy is to expand the number of our retail garden centers throughout North America. The hydroponic retail landscape is fragmented, which allows us to acquire the “best of breed” hydroponic retail operations. In addition to the 13 states we are currently operating in, we have identified new market opportunities in states that include Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Mississippi, Missouri and Virginia. During 2021, the Company acquired 23 new locations.
Our commercial sales organization is focused on selling end to end solutions for large commercial cultivators. When a commercial customer gains a new cultivation license, they will need to purchase lighting, benching, environmental control 
systems, irrigation, fertigation and other products to outfit their cultivation facility. Commercial customers typically purchase in larger dollar amounts and sizes of products. We offer commercial customers volume pricing, terms and financing. Our commercial team manages thousands of commercial accounts across North America. 
E-Commerce/Omni-Channel 
Our digital strategy is focused on capturing the home, craft and commercial grower online. GrowGeneration.com offers over 10,000 hydroponic products, all curated by our product team. GrowGeneration.com offers customers the option to have their orders shipped directly to their locations, anywhere in North America. 
Proprietary Brands and Private Label 
In December 2020, GrowGeneration purchased the business of Canopy Crop Management Corp., the developer of the popular Power Si line of monosilicic acid products, a widely used nutrient additive for plants. On March 12, 2021, the Company purchased CharCoir, a line of premium coco pots, cubes and medium. We believe that expanding our private label offerings will have a positive impact on our margins and profitability in the near term. We use various trademarks and trade names in our private- label business, including Ion Lighting, Sunleaves powder nutrients and additive line, Optilime Bulbs, Blueprint controllers and timers, Growxcess pots and containers, Harvest Edge pruners, trellis and other gardening accessories, Durabreeze fans and dehumidifiers, and Drip Hydro nutrients. Both “GrowGeneration” and “Where the Pros Go to Grow” are trademarks used to brand and market our garden centers across North America.
Competitive Advantages
As the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers by revenue and number of stores in the United States based on management’s estimates, we believe that we have the following core competitive advantages over our competitors:
•We offer a one-stop shopping experience to all types of growers by providing “selection, service, and solutions”;
•We provide end-to-end solutions for our commercial customers from capex built-out to consumables to nourish their plants;
•We have a knowledge-based sales team, all with horticultural experience;
•We offer the options to transact online, in store, or buy online and pick up;
•We consider ourselves to be a leader of the products we offer, from launching new technologies to the development of our private label products;
•We have an experienced professional team to acquire and open new locations, products and technologies and successfully add them to our company portfolio.
Community Service and Charity
GrowGeneration, together with Harvest 360 Technologies, LLC (H360), has launched a new program to support education and training for social equity license applicants. Regulations in both New York and New Jersey seek to create a framework to regulate cannabis in these states in a manner that promotes social equity and economic development, placing an emphasis on promoting inclusion of diverse populations in the medicinal and recreational cannabis industries. GrowGeneration is committed to delivering solutions to these operators and supporting their communities. This program with H360 gives GrowGeneration a direct method to help new companies grow their businesses. 
As part of this program, GrowGeneration and H360 have established the NEXTGEN Micro Cultivation competition for applicants seeking micro grow licenses in the New Jersey adult-use cannabis market. GrowGeneration has committed up to $500,000 to provide education and training scholarships for 25 cultivation teams participating in the competition. GrowGeneration will also provide access to equipment packages and market resources. All contestants will get access to an online cultivation portal with valuable resources to assist in the preparation of an application and to be educated and informed about best practices in the New Jersey program.
The 25 finalist teams that make it to the second round will also receive complete planning and engineering services for their facilities from GrowGeneration, as well as access to a compliant business services package from H360 worth thousands of dollars. Five winning teams will then be selected by a panel of judges to receive a comprehensive package, including financing, advanced training, business service packages, and direct operational support.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Sales
The Company generates sales primarily from the sale of hydroponic garden products, including nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems, vertical benching, and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services, at which point the performance obligation is satisfied. Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Customer deposits and lay away sales are not reported as revenue until final payment is received and the merchandise has been delivered.
Our sales depend on the type of products we sell and the mix between consumables and non-consumables. Due to their nature, purchases of consumables result in repeat orders as customers seek to replenish their supplies. Generally, in new markets where legalization of plant-based medicines is recent and licensors are ramping up their grow operations, there are more purchases of non-consumables for buildouts compared to purchases of consumables. In more mature markets, there are generally more purchases of consumables than non-consumables. Our sales are also impacted by our customer mix of commercial and non-commercial customers, as larger commercial customers may receive volume discounts and other promotions. A majority of our sales are derived from our commercial customers.
Gross Profit
We calculate gross profit as sales less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists of cost of product sold, freight, and tariffs. Gross profit excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately in our consolidated statements of operations.
Our overall gross profit margin varies with our product mix, in particular the percentage of sales of consumable products versus non-consumables, such as in connection with buildouts. In addition, our customer mix impacts gross profit margin due to larger commercial customers receiving discounts.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are comprised of store operations, primarily payroll, rent and utilities, and corporate overhead. Corporate overhead is comprised of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative costs and corporate salaries and related expenses. General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) consist mainly of advertising and promotions, travel & entertainment, professional fees, and insurance. G&A as a percentage of sales does not increase commensurate with an increase in sales. Our largest expenses are payroll and rent and these are largely fixed and not variable. Our advertising and marketing expenses are controllable and variable depending on the particular market.
Same-Store Sales
We assess the organic growth of our sales on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired stores become eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base if the store has been under our ownership for the entire period in the same-store base periods for which we are including the store. 
Research and Development
The Company has not incurred any research and development expenses during the period covered by this report. 
Customers and Suppliers 
Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the Company increases focus on serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing activity, compared to its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy. Currently, none of our customers accounted for more than 5% of our sales in 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Our key suppliers include several manufacturers and distributors such as Hawthorne Garden Supply, Hydrofarm, Fluence Engineering, Advanced Nutrients, House and Gardens, FoxFarm Fertilizer, Canna Gradening, and others. All the products purchased and sold are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. As of December 31, 2021, one supplier represented 28% of all of our purchases. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, two suppliers represented 41% and 51%, respectively, of all our purchases. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of 
either supplier would not have a material adverse impact on our business. The Company also maintains direct manufacturing agreements with certain vendors.

Seasonality
Our business is subject to some seasonal influences. Historically, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second and third fiscal quarters, and the lower volume occurs during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. 
Competition 
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, as well as online product resellers and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay. Our industry is a highly fragmented industry with over 1,000 retail hydroponic retailers throughout the U.S.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers in North America and our pricing, inventory and product availability and overall customer service provide us the ability to compete in our industry. In addition, as we continue to increase the number of garden centers, we expect to be able to continue to purchase inventory at lower volume prices, which we expect will enable us to price competitively and deliver the products that our customers are seeking. The Company competes by delivering the widest selection of hydroponics products, end to end solutions for all types of cultivation environments, in-store sales and product support, direct manufacturer pricing and world-class customer service.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
Our intellectual property includes our brands and their related trademarks, domain names and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product knowledge and technology, patents, and marketing intangibles. We also hold rights to website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.GrowGeneration.com. We own several the federally registered trademarks, including for “GrowGeneration®” and “Where the Pros Go to Grow®” as well as our proprietary brands.
Government Regulation 
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. 
In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.  For example, certain countries and 36 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. In addition, with the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also removes restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. We believe passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will continue to allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities.
Our gardening products, including our hydroponic gardening products, are multi-purpose products designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp.  Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws (including federal legalization of cannabis), regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.
Employees 
We strive to foster a collaborative and team-oriented culture and view our human capital resources as an ongoing priority. As of February 23, 2022, we employ 687 employees: 634 full-time employees, 49 part-time employees, 4 independent contractors, no temporary or seasonal workers. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe we offer competitive terms and incentives to attract and retain employees. Our retention rate for our full-time employees is approximately three years, and we employ various initiatives to attract new employees and retain existing employees, including employer contributions to health and welfare benefits, 401(k) plan matching, bonus programs and training opportunities. In late 2021, we also engaged a compensation consultant to ensure our key employee compensation packages are competitive. 
Principal Offices
Our principal offices are located at 5619 DTC Parkway, Suite 900, Greenwood Village, CO 80111. Currently, we lease 11 facilities in the State of Colorado, 26 in the State of California, 2 the State of Nevada, 3 in the State of Washington, 4 in the State of Oregon, 1 in the state of Arizona, 1 in the State of Rhode Island, 5 in the State of Oklahoma, 7 in the State of Michigan, 5 in the State of Maine, 2 in the State of Florida, 1 in the State of New Mexico, and 1 in the State of Massachusetts, all for our corporate and retail operations. In total the Company currently leases approximately 900,000 square feet of space, which consists primarily of 7,000 feet of corporate office space, 100,000 square feet of warehouse space and 800,000 square feet of store space.
