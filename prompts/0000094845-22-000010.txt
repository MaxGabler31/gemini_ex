Item 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
From our California Gold Rush beginnings, we have grown into one of the world's largest brand-name apparel companies. A history of responsible business practices, rooted in our core values, has helped us build our brands and engender consumer trust around the world. Under our Levi's®, Dockers®, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brands, we design, market and sell – directly or through third parties and licensees – products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, dresses, jackets, footwear, and related accessories for men, women and children around the world. Our newest brand, Beyond Yoga®, acquired in 2021, is a body positive, premium athleisure apparel brand focused on quality, fit and comfort for all shapes and sizes. 
COVID-19 Impact on our Business in Fiscal 2021
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business and results of operations in fiscal year 2021. While many of our company-operated stores and wholesale customer doors were open for most of the year, reduced consumer confidence and changes in shopping patterns adversely impacted store traffic, as more consumers were either not shopping or choosing to shop online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, resurgences of COVID-19 cases led to temporary store closures of company-operated and wholesale customer retail locations for portions of the year in certain markets and have impacted, and continue to impact, our supply chain partners, including third party manufacturers, logistic providers and other vendors. Current vessel, container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and are expected to continue to delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our wholesale customers and availability in our company-operated stores and e-commerce sites. 
Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. As stores re-opened, we followed local health guidelines, as well as internally derived specific health-related criteria with an emphasis on comprehensive safety precautions, and we continue to adapt our retail and distribution center practices to support the well-being of our workers. As we have re-opened our corporate offices, we have adopted new and flexible ways of working to best support each individual employee's needs. This includes the adoption of a new hybrid work environment. 
Despite the many challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought and continues to bring, we continue to focus on areas that will drive value and enable us to emerge stronger on the other side, including elevating our brand, investing in digital tools and capabilities, and accelerating our efforts to diversify across geographies, product categories and distribution channels, including our direct-to-consumer and digital businesses. We remain committed to increasing total shareholder returns through deploying capital across all of our capital allocation priorities. These include high growth investments in our business, returning capital to our shareholders and executing both organic and inorganic mergers and acquisitions, such as the Beyond Yoga® acquisition, which we completed during the fourth quarter.
Segments
In fiscal year 2021, we simplified our organization structure and created an integrated global commercial organization to continue to elevate and strengthen our Levi's commercial business. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we separated our Dockers business to provide focus and reinvigorate the brand's growth. We are leveraging a similar, separate structure for the newly acquired Beyond Yoga business in order to support its continued growth trajectory. 
As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we changed our segment reporting. Our Levi's Brands business, which includes the Levi's, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brands, is presented in our financial statements under the caption of Levi's Brands and is defined geographically in three reportable segments: Americas, Europe and Asia. The Dockers® business, which is managed separately, is no longer reported in the geographical regions of Americas, Europe and Asia. Our newly acquired Beyond Yoga® business, along with the Dockers® business, do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are presented in our financial statements under the caption of Other Brands. While this reporting change did not impact consolidated results, the segment data has been recast to be consistent for all periods presented throughout the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. For additional information, including the financial results of our segments, see Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Our Global Reach
Our products are sold in more than 110 countries. We service our customers through our global infrastructure, developing, sourcing and marketing our products around the world. Although our brands are recognized as authentically "American," we 
Table of Contents

derived over half of our net revenues from outside the United States in fiscal year 2021. As a global company with sales and operations in foreign countries, we are subject to risks of doing business in foreign countries. For more information, see "Item 1A – Risk Factors."
Our products are sold in approximately 50,000 retail locations worldwide, including approximately 3,100 brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops. In the United States, chain retailers and department stores have traditionally been the primary distribution channels for our Levi's® and Dockers® products. Outside the United States, department stores, specialty retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops have traditionally been our primary distribution channels. Levi's® and Dockers® products are also sold through our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and through our global digital business, which includes our company-operated e-commerce sites as well as the online businesses of our wholesale customers, including those of traditional wholesalers as well as pure-play (online-only) wholesalers. Beyond Yoga® products are sold in the United States primarily through specialty retailers, pure-play wholesalers and a company-operated brand dedicated e-commerce site. We distribute Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brand products primarily through mass channel retailers in the Americas, including the e-commerce sites operated by some of our key wholesale customers and other pure-play customers.
We were founded in San Francisco, California in 1853 and were incorporated in Delaware in 1970. We conduct our operations outside the United States through foreign subsidiaries. Our primary corporate office is located at Levi's Plaza, 1155 Battery Street, San Francisco, California 94111, and our main telephone number is (415) 501-6000.

Our Business Strategies
Our growth and financial performance over the last several years resulted from the key growth strategies our management team adopted to guide the decisions and choices that we've made. In fiscal 2021, we shifted our focus to prioritize the most important areas that we believe will drive our long-term success. The following three “where to play” choices serve as our strategic framework for what we intend to achieve:
•Brand Led: Our brands are authentic, original and loved by consumers the world over. We plan to continue to elevate and strengthen them through integrating product, design, marketing and consumer in-store experience with a global vision executed consistently across the markets where we operate. Through product and communications that drive impact and engage the hearts and minds of our consumers, we intend to maintain our existing consumers while also creating new life-long fans. Driven by conscious consumerism and denim and style leadership, our goal is to maintain market share leadership in Levi’s® men’s and grow market share in Levi’s® women’s and with youth. We believe that a critical part of this will be our continued thought leadership in areas where our values and brands go hand in hand — like equality, sustainability and civic engagement — to drive brand equity. Similarly, we will apply the same ambitions to Dockers®, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.TM, Denizen® and Beyond Yoga®.
•DTC First: Our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") business has grown from 20% of our net revenues in 2011 to nearly 40% of our net revenues in fiscal year 2021, and our ambition is to drive this toward 60% of our annual net revenues by 2030. Our DTC channels allow us to connect directly with our consumers and deliver the best experience for them because we control their brand experience. As a result, we plan to accelerate investing in our stores and online platforms to elevate consumer experiences in store and online, and expand our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, with a focus on mainline expansion as a step to continue elevating the brand in key markets, to create the kind of memorable connections that make loyal fans for life, ultimately benefiting our business across all channels. One of our “DTC First” strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers 
Table of Contents

through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. We believe growth of our DTC business will be accretive to our company gross margins and improve the overall profitability of the company. Over time, we plan to operate more like a retailer and less like a wholesaler, and pivot everything we do to drive success in our stores and online. 
•Further Diversify our Portfolio: We plan to further capitalize on our substantial opportunity to amplify our reach and grow share across geographies, categories, genders and channels, increasing our flexibility and resilience. We plan to continue to drive growth in our international business, with a specific focus on China. By 2030, we plan to achieve gender parity by driving outsized growth in women’s, as well as in our product categories beyond jeans—tops, accessories, outerwear, footwear, non-denim bottoms and activewear—which collectively we intend to comprise more than half our annual net revenues. In the wholesale channel, we plan to grow our business with partners that are growing, allowing us to unlock the opportunity to elevate the Levi’s® brand as well as increase the penetration of our value brands. We expect continued growth of the online business of our pure-play and traditional wholesale customers, leading to a total global digital footprint—inclusive of our own e-commerce business—comprising more than a third of our annual net revenues by 2030. Finally, we will also evaluate opportunities to diversify our portfolio of brands through accretive organic and inorganic acquisitions that make strategic and financial sense, and that are consistent with our company culture, such as the acquisition of activewear brand Beyond Yoga® that we completed during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our success will be driven not just by what we do, but how we do it. Our three strategic choices are supported by a foundation of the following three “how to win” choices: 
•Digital Transformation: Our vision for enterprise-wide digital transformation is to create a superior consumer experience and drive profitability through digital technology, data and artificial intelligence ("AI"), and new ways of working. We plan to continue to build out key omni-channel capabilities on a global basis, upgrading and improving our digital shopping platforms globally. We also plan to adopt digital tools across the business to harness the competitive advantage our data provides — allowing us to make data and AI-informed decisions, respond more quickly to market trends and focus our time on the most strategic work. We will continue to upgrade our enterprise resource planning system in the coming years, automating and digitizing processes, while linking our enterprise systems in a seamless manner, creating a more simplified work environment. We believe all these efforts will contribute towards growing our digital footprint and higher operating margins. 
•Operational Excellence: To stay one step ahead of the competition, we must continue to embrace agility, reduce complexity and execute consistently, always striving to find more streamlined ways of working. For example, we have taken and will continue to take steps to improve our speed to market calendar and agility with a focus on servicing consumer demand globally, such as creating fewer touch points as merchandise goes to market and leveraging our F.L.X. technology, which uses lasers to digitize denim finish design, to improve operational agility and improved inventory management. We expect that by simplifying the way we work and driving more efficiency and agility in responding to changes in consumer demand, we will see improved inventory turns, reduced lead times and improvements in working capital and our cash conversion cycle.
•Financial Discipline: We plan to continue to manage our costs aggressively so that we can invest in the areas that will drive growth and help us deliver Adjusted EBIT margins in excess of 12%. For the fiscal year ended November 28, 2021, our Adjusted EBIT margin grew to 12.4% and our intent is to see modest Adjusted EBIT margin improvement annually. As we grow net revenues and gross margins, we plan to drive leverage on our investments, improve our structural economics across channels, and deliver returns on invested capital in the mid-to-high twenties. For more information on our calculation of Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBIT and return on invested capital, see “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Across all of our brands, pants – including jeans, casual pants, dress pants and activewear – represented 67%, 65% and 65% of our total units sold in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Men's products generated 65%, 64% and 67% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We also offer premium products around the world under the Levi's® brand, including a range of premium pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear, and related accessories. 
Our Levi's® brand products accounted for 87% of our net revenues in each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, approximately half of which were generated in our Americas segment.
Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® Brands 
In addition to our Levi's® brand, we offer the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brands, which are focused on value-conscious consumers who seek quality craftsmanship and great fit and style at affordable prices. We offer denim jeans, casual pants, tops and jackets in a variety of fits, fabrics and finishes for men, women and children under the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ brand through the mass retail channel in the United States and Canada. The Denizen® brand was introduced in the United States starting in 2011, and includes a variety of jeans to complement active lifestyles and to empower consumers to express their aspirations, individuality and attitudes. The Denizen® brand is sold through wholesale accounts in the United States.
Our Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brand products collectively accounted for 8%, 8% and 7% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Dockers® Brand 
Founded in 1986, the Dockers® brand sparked a revolution in the way millions of men dressed around the world, shifting from the standard issue suit to a more casual look. More than 30 years later, the Dockers® brand now embodies California style, bringing a full range of casual, versatile styles for men and women.
Our Dockers® brand products accounted for 5%, 5% and 6% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are sold in more than 50 countries.
Beyond Yoga® Brand
Our Beyond Yoga® brand is a body positive, premium athleisure apparel brand focused on quality, fit and comfort for all shapes and sizes. Beyond Yoga® was founded in 2005 to promote body positivity, honoring and celebrating every body from XXS-4X. We completed the acquisition of the Beyond Yoga® brand in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Licensing 
The appeal of our brands across consumer groups and our global reach enable us to license our Levi's® and Dockers® trademarks for a variety of product categories in multiple markets globally, including footwear, belts, wallets and bags, outerwear, sweaters, dress shirts, kidswear, sleepwear and hosiery. Licensing accounted for 2% of our total net revenues in each of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Table of Contents

We enter into licensing agreements with our licensees covering royalty payments, product design and manufacturing standards, marketing and sale of licensed products, and protection of our trademarks. We require our licensees to follow our sustainability strategy, policies and guidelines, including being compliant with our code of conduct for contract manufacturing and engage independent monitors to perform regular on-site inspections and assessments of production facilities.
Sales, Distribution and Customers
We recognize wholesale revenue from sales of our products through third-party retailers such as department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchise locations dedicated to our brands. We also sell our products directly to consumers through a variety of formats, including our own company-operated mainline and outlet stores, company-operated e-commerce sites and select shop-in-shops located in department stores and other third-party retail locations. 
We seek to make our products available where consumers shop, providing both in-store and online shopping experiences, as well as offering products that are appropriately tailored for our wholesale customers and their retail consumers. We take care to select wholesale customers and distributors that we believe will represent our brands in a manner consistent with our values and growth strategies. Sales to our top ten wholesale customers for fiscal year 2021, fiscal year 2020, and fiscal year 2019, totaled 32%, 29% and 26% of our net revenues in those fiscal years, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues in any of these years. 
We also sell our products directly to consumers through shop-in-shops located in certain of our wholesale customers’ and other third-party retail locations. Typically, this format is conducted on a concession basis, whereby the inventory continues to be owned by us (not the retailer) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in these transactions are generally our employees and not those of the retailer. We recognize revenue in the amount of the sale to the end consumer, while paying our partners a commission. We operated approximately 500 of these shop-in-shops as of November 28, 2021.
Dedicated Stores and E-commerce Sites
We believe retail stores dedicated to our brands are important for the growth, visibility, availability and commercial success of our brands, and they are an increasingly important part of our "DTC First" strategy. Our brand-dedicated stores are either operated by us or by independent third parties such as franchisees. In addition to the dedicated stores, we maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites that sell products directly to consumers.
Company-operated brick-and-mortar retail stores.  Our company-operated retail stores, comprising both mainline and outlet stores, generated 25%, 26% and 27% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of November 28, 2021, we had 1,083 company-operated stores located in 37 countries. The majority of the stores are dedicated to the Levi's® brand, with 360 stores in the Americas, 344 stores in Europe, and 328 stores in Asia. We had 51 Dockers® brand-dedicated stores globally. During 2021, we added 92 company-operated stores and closed 51 stores.
Franchised and other stores.  Franchised, licensed, or other forms of brand-dedicated stores operated by independent third parties sell Levi's® and Dockers® products in markets outside the United States. There were approximately 1,300 of these stores as of November 28, 2021, and they are a key element of our international distribution. In addition to these stores, we consider our network of brand-dedicated shop-in-shops, which are located within department stores and may be either operated directly by us or third parties, to be an important component of our retail distribution in international markets. Outside the United States, approximately 200 of these shop-in-shops were operated by third parties as of November 28, 2021.
E-commerce sites. We maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites, including www.levi.com, www.dockers.com and www.beyondyoga.com, that sell products directly to consumers across multiple markets around the world. These sites represented 8%, 8% and 5% of overall net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019; and 21%, 21% and 14% of DTC channel net revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Seasonality of Sales
We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter. In fiscal year 2021, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 23%, 22%, 26% and 29%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. In fiscal year 2020, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 34%, 11%, 24% and 31%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year.
We typically achieve a significant amount of revenues from our DTC channel on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, which is commonly referred to as Black Friday. Due to the timing of our fiscal year end, a particular fiscal year might include one, two or no Black Fridays, which could impact our net revenues for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2019 did not have a Black Friday, while fiscal year 2020 had two Black Fridays. Fiscal year 2021 included one Black Friday.
Table of Contents

We use a 52- or 53- week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have fiscal years ending November 30. Each fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week quarters, with each quarter ending on the Sunday that is closest to the last day of the month of that quarter. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year, ending on November 28, 2021, and fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were 52-week years, ending on November 29, 2020 and November 24, 2019, respectively. Each quarter of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2020, which consisted of 14 weeks. 
The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season, but they could also be impacted by other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, including pandemics such as COVID-19. 
Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019; however, our business could be affected by inflation in the future, which we plan to mitigate through a combination of pricing actions and operating efficiencies, although these actions could have an adverse impact on demand.
Marketing and Promotion
Our marketing is rooted in globally consistent brand messages that reflect the unique attributes of our brands, including the Levi's® brand as the authentic and original jeanswear brand and Dockers® brand as the definitive khaki. We continually strengthen our portfolio of brands and our positioning at the center of popular culture with a diverse mix of marketing initiatives to drive consumer demand, such as through social media and digital and mobile outlets, sponsorships, product placement in leading fashion magazines and with celebrities, television and radio advertisements, personal sponsorships and endorsements, and selective collaborations with key influencers, integrating ourselves with significant cultural events, and on-the-ground efforts such as street-level events and similar targeted "viral" marketing activities. We also connect with sport and music fans across the world, including through the naming rights to the stadium for the San Francisco 49ers, which we secured in 2013. 
We are focused on strengthening our brands globally. Through product and communications, our plan is to drive impact and engage the hearts and minds of our consumers while connecting directly and delivering the best experience possible through our DTC channel. In 2021, we launched our Global TikTok channel and began holding shoppable livestream events on levi.com. To celebrate the birthday of the Levi’s® 501® jean, which has provided effortless cool style to working men and women, rock stars and everyone in between for decades, the Levi’s® brand threw a global virtual festival. Broadcast around the world from our official @Levis Instagram account, the festival featured musical performances, meaningful conversations and DIY denim personalization and repair sessions with in-house tailors. We also continued to bring energy to the market through a number of exciting, high profile collaborations with Valentino, Miu Miu and Denim Tears, yielding strong sell-throughs and elevating the brand with distribution in premium doors and features across leading publications. We also introduced Tailor Shop Virtual Workshops, began piloting self check-out, and launched a Shop the Store function on our app in the Americas. 
Our marketing organization includes both global and commercial marketing teams. Our global marketing team is responsible for developing a toolkit of marketing assets and brand guidelines to be applied across all marketing activities, including media, engagement, brand environment and in-store activation. Our commercial marketing teams adapt global tools for local relevance and execute marketing strategies within the markets where we operate.
We also use our websites, including www.levi.com, www.dockers.com, and www.beyondyoga.com in relevant markets to enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, these websites is not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and references to our website addressed in this Annual Report are inactive textual references only.
Sourcing and Logistics
Organization.  Our global sourcing and logistics organizations are responsible for taking a product from the design concept stage through production to delivery to our customers. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve product development and sourcing efficiencies and reduce total product and distribution costs while maintaining our focus on product quality, local service levels and working capital management. Our presence in more than 110 countries enables us to leverage our global scale for product development and sourcing while using our local expertise to tailor products and retail experiences to individual markets. Our integrated production development and distribution platform enables us to achieve operating efficiencies and deliver superior quality products.
Product procurement.  We source nearly all of our products through independent contract manufacturers. We may have minimum inventory purchase commitments, including fabric commitments, with suppliers that secure a portion of material 
Table of Contents

needs for future seasons. The remainder is sourced from our company-operated manufacturing and finishing plants. See "Item 2 – Properties" for more information about these manufacturing facilities.
Sources and availability of raw materials.  The principal fibers used in the majority of our products include cotton, synthetics and man-made cellulosics that are used to produce fabrics of 100% composition or blends. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors. The price fluctuations impact the cost of our products in future seasons due to the lead time of our product development cycle. Fluctuations in product costs can cause a decrease in our profitability if product pricing actions taken in response are insufficient or if those actions cause our wholesale customers or retail consumers to reduce the volumes they purchase.
Sourcing locations.  We use numerous independent contract manufacturers located throughout the world for the production and finishing of our garments. We conduct assessments of political, social, environmental, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products before placing production in those countries and on an ongoing basis. We also monitor ongoing global trade regulations to optimize our supply chain networks in response to changes in tariffs or other trade policies around the world.
Due to COVID-19 related lockdowns in certain countries, in fiscal year 2021, we sourced products from independent contract manufacturers located in approximately 22 countries around the world, with no more than 25% sourced from any single country, an increase from our standard practice of sourcing less than 20% from any single country. We expect to return to our historical practice in 2023, assuming product costs, including inflationary impacts, return to pre-pandemic levels. We sourced products in North and South Asia, the Americas, including the United States, Europe and Africa.
Sourcing practices.  Our sourcing practices include these elements: 
•We require all third-party vendors, including licensees and their authorized subcontractors, who manufacture or finish products for us to contribute to our sustainability goals and to follow all established policies and guidelines. They must comply with our code of conduct relating to supplier working conditions as well as environmental, employment and sourcing practices. 
•Our supplier code of conduct covers employment practices such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age and discriminatory practices, environmental matters such as wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal, and ethical and legal conduct. We regularly evaluate and refine our code of conduct processes.
•We regularly assess manufacturing and finishing facilities against our supplier code of conduct through periodic on-site facility inspections and improvement activities, including use of independent monitors to supplement our internal staff. We integrate review and performance results into our sourcing decisions. We encourage collaboration among apparel companies in factory monitoring and improvement.
•We regularly disclose the names and locations of our vendors to provide transparency into our supply chain. We regularly evaluate and refine our supplier code of conduct processes.
Logistics.  We use company-operated and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce customers. For more information, see "Item 2 – Properties." Distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our contract manufacturers and plants, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail presentation, and shipping them to our customers and to our own stores. Our distribution centers maintain a combination of replenishment and seasonal inventory. In certain locations around the globe, we have consolidated our distribution centers to service multiple countries.
Competition
The global apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented. It is characterized by low barriers to entry, brands targeted at specific consumer segments, many regional and local competitors, and an increasing number of global competitors. Principal competitive factors include: 
•anticipating and responding to changing consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner, and ensuring product availability at wholesale and DTC channels;
•developing high-quality, innovative products with relevant designs, fits, finishes, fabrics, style and performance features that meet consumer desires and trends;
•maintaining favorable and strong brand name recognition and appeal through strong and effective marketing support and consumer intelligence in diverse market segments;
Table of Contents

•identifying and securing desirable new retail locations and presenting products effectively at company-operated retail and franchised and other brand-dedicated stores;
•ensuring high-profile product placement at retailers;
•anticipating and responding to consumer expectations regarding e-commerce shopping and shipping;
•optimizing supply chain cost efficiencies and product development cycle lead times;
•creating products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our geographic regions; and
•generating competitive economics for wholesale customers, including retailers, franchisees, and licensees.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
We face competition from a broad range of competitors at the global and local levels in diverse channels across a wide range of retail price points, and some of our competitors are larger and have more resources in the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors include vertically integrated specialty stores, jeanswear brands, khakiwear brands, athletic and activewear companies, retailers' private or exclusive labels, and certain e-commerce sites. 
Government Regulations
 Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see "Item 1A - Risk Factors".
Intellectual Property
We have more than 5,700 trademark registrations and pending applications in approximately 180 jurisdictions worldwide, and we acquire rights in new trademarks according to business needs. Substantially all of our global trademarks are owned by Levi Strauss & Co. We regard our trademarks as one of our most valuable assets and believe they have substantial value in the marketing of our products. The Levi's®, Dockers®, Beyond Yoga® and 501® trademarks, the Arcuate Stitching Design, the Tab Device, the Two Horse® Design, the Housemark and the Wings and Anchor Design are among our core trademarks.
We protect these trademarks by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with governmental agencies in other countries, particularly where our products are manufactured or sold. We work vigorously to enforce and protect our trademark rights by engaging in regular market reviews, helping local law enforcement authorities detect and prosecute counterfeiters, issuing cease-and-desist letters against third parties infringing or denigrating our trademarks, opposing registration of infringing trademarks, and initiating litigation as necessary. We are currently pursuing over 290 infringement matters around the world. We also work with trade groups and industry participants seeking to strengthen laws relating to the protection of intellectual property rights in markets around the world. 
As of November 28, 2021, we had 27 issued U.S. patents and 48 U.S. patent applications pending. Our patents expire between 2025 and 2040. We also have 41 international and foreign patent applications pending. We will continually assess the ability to patent new intellectual property as we develop technologies that we believe are innovative, such as our F.L.X. technology. 
History and Corporate Citizenship
Our story began in San Francisco, California in 1853 as a wholesale dry goods business. We invented the blue jean 20 years later. In 1873, we received a U.S. patent for “waist overalls” with metal rivets at points of strain. The first product line designated by the lot number "501" was created in 1890.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, our work pants were worn primarily by cowboys, miners and other working men in the western United States. Then, in 1934, we introduced our first jeans for women, and after World War II, our jeans began to appeal to a wider market. By the 1960s, they had become a symbol of American culture, representing a unique blend of history

and youth. We opened our export and international businesses in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. The Dockers® brand helped drive "Casual Friday" in the 1990s and has been a cornerstone of casual menswear for more than 30 years.
Today, descendants of the family of Levi Strauss continue to be actively involved in our company. Our Class B common stock is primarily owned by these descendants and their relatives and trusts established for their behalf. In order to facilitate a forum for frequent, open and constructive dialogue between us and these stockholders, the family members have organized a family council, which engages with us on topics of mutual interest, such as our industry, governance, ownership and philanthropy. Management shares information and interacts with the family members, including the family council, in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
Throughout this long history, we have upheld our strong belief that we can help shape society through civic engagement and community involvement, responsible labor and workplace practices, philanthropy, ethical conduct, environmental stewardship and transparency. We engage in a "profits through principles" business approach and constantly strive to set higher standards for ourselves and the industry. Our milestone initiatives over the years include: integrating our factories prior to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; developing a comprehensive supplier code of conduct that requires safe and healthy working conditions before such codes of conduct became commonplace among multinational apparel companies; offering benefits to same-sex partners in the 1990s, long before most other companies; and in early 2020, offering up to eight weeks of paid family leave to help ease the strain on U.S.-based employees caring for an immediate family member with a serious medical condition. 
Environmental, Social and Governance and Human Capital
Environmental, Social and Governance
We continue to deliver industry-leading sustainability approaches and product innovations that support our vision of a circular economy, an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources, in the apparel industry. In 2021, we achieved a number of important milestones and received welcome recognition, including the release of our first annual sustainability report informed by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainable Accounting Standard Board (SASB) standards. In 2021, we also launched Buy Better, Wear Longer, a global marketing campaign that urges customers to be more intentional about purchasing decisions and launched Levi’s® Secondhand a buy back and resale platform that extends our products’ useful lives.
Our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") strategy centers on three main pillars — climate, consumption, and community — that encompass where we are putting our energy and how we see our obligations in and beyond this moment. Our climate pillar encompasses environmental impacts, including climate action, water stewardship and biodiversity; our consumption pillar encompasses the circular economy, sustainable fibers, use of safer chemicals and waste reduction; and our community pillar encompasses social and societal impacts, including diversity, equity and inclusion, employee support and development, supply chain transparency, standards and improvements, using our voice, and philanthropy and volunteering. To achieve our goals, we plan to continue fortifying each pillar, to deliver meaningful progress while evolving our efforts to ensure our business becomes more sustainable, day by day.
While we take great pride in being a leader in these efforts, we know continued action is necessary to meet our future targets and drive the change we need to see in our industry. We’re proud to report that our owned-and-operated facilities now source approximately 70% of electricity from renewable sources, with the goal of 100% by 2025, in line with our science-based targets on climate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This effort was buoyed by the installation of a solar array in 2020 at our LEED Platinum certified distribution center in Henderson, Nevada, which will help offset approximately 20% of that facility's electricity use.
Human Capital Management 
As of November 28, 2021, we employed approximately 16,600 people, approximately 7,700 of whom were located in the Americas, 4,600 of whom were located in Europe, and 4,300 of whom were located in Asia. As of such date, approximately 1,600 of our employees were associated with the manufacturing and procurement of our products, 8,700 worked in retail, including seasonal employees, 1,500 worked in distribution and 4,800 were other non-production employees. As of November 28, 2021, approximately 4,150 of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We believe in living our values: originality, empathy, integrity and courage. This means we strive to create a workplace where everyone feels valued, empowered and welcomed to be their authentic selves. 
Since 2018, our workforce diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") efforts have been focused on empowering women, measuring and ensuring pay equity and recruiting diverse talent. Some of our key achievements include establishing a DE&I function, launching employee resource groups and career development programs for underrepresented populations and fostering inclusion and allyship globally.
In 2020, we made a series of new commitments to hire, support, promote and elevate diversity at the company, with a goal to ensure our workforce is as diverse as the communities we serve. This includes our specific commitments to improve our representation in our corporate and leadership ranks, ensure an inclusive culture and advocate externally in support of racial justice. We published our U.S. demographic representation data for the first time ever, with a commitment to share annually. 
In fiscal year 2021, we hired a Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, welcomed our first Black board of directors member and hired an executive to lead University & Diversity Talent Acquisition, roles that we believe will help guide and enable our global commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Also beginning in 2021, we began tying a portion of our senior executive compensation to the achievement of certain multi-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
Pay Equity. In fiscal year 2020, we conducted a pay equity study for our U.S. non-union population. The study considered job level, performance, experience, and other factors such as promotion recency to examine our relative pay practices across gender and ethnicity in each population. We did not find any significant pay differences across gender and ethnicity. We have committed to conduct this study in the U.S. every other year and are working on a global approach that is appropriate for countries with smaller employee counts. In fiscal year 2021, we conducted pay transparency insights sessions with people managers to ensure pay equity practices were sustained. 
Total Rewards. Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them balance their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, product discounts, and a culture of recognition.
