ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (the Company, Holdings, we, us, and our) is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company's primary asset is sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian). Hawaiian was originally incorporated in January 1929 under the laws of the Territory of Hawai'i and became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to a corporate restructuring that was consummated in August 2002. Hawaiian became a Delaware corporation and the Company's direct wholly-owned subsidiary concurrent with its reorganization and reacquisition by the Company in June 2005.
Our Business
We are engaged in the scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo amongst the Hawaiian Islands (the Neighbor Island routes), between the Hawaiian Islands and certain cities in the United States (the North America routes, and together with the Neighbor Island routes, the Domestic routes), and between the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (the International routes), collectively referred to as our Scheduled Operations. We offer non-stop service to Hawai'i from 16 cities, which is more U.S. gateway cities than any other airline, and also provide approximately 144 daily flights between the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, we operate various charter flights.
We are the longest serving airline, as well as the largest airline headquartered, in the state of Hawai'i, and the 12th largest domestic airline in the United States based on revenue passenger miles (RPMs) reported by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration Bureau of Transportation Services as of October 2021, the latest data available.
At December 31, 2021, our fleet consisted of 19 Boeing 717-200 aircraft for the Neighbor Island routes and 24 Airbus A330-200 aircraft and 18 Airbus A321neo aircraft utilized primarily on our North America and International routes. Additionally, we own three ATR42 and four ATR72 aircraft, which were previously utilized in our "'Ohana by Hawaiian" operations that we terminated during 2021. Following termination of operations, we committed to a plan of sale and reclassified the ATR aircraft and related asset group as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to complete our disposition of the asset group in the first half of 2022. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Our goal is to be the number one destination carrier serving Hawai'i. We are devoted to the travel needs of the residents of and visitors to Hawai'i and we offer a unique travel experience. We are strongly rooted in the culture and people of Hawai'i and we seek to provide high quality service to our customers that exemplifies the spirit of Aloha.
Purpose and Values
Our purpose is to connect people with Aloha. It captures how we bring people closer together, and how we share the Aloha spirit with the people and places we serve. It is core to who we are, how we see the world and how we engage with the people and places around us. Aloha is a way of life, but also a choice each of our employees makes every day, constantly striving to be the very best we can be. With Aloha in everything we do, we share moments and our spirit with guests and each other. 
Our values, reflected below, guide how we act, lead, and make decisions:
•Mālama (Care): We care about the people and places we serve, and personally commit to their well-being 
•Ho‘okipa (Hospitality): We are genuine hosts, welcoming people into our home with warmth, gratitude and full hearts 
•Lōkahi (Collaboration): We come together in harmony, always seeking better ways to succeed as a team 
•Po‘okela (Excellence): We strive for excellence, competing to thrive
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
The widespread and unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the resulting restrictions on travel and every day activities by local, state, federal, and international governments, significantly reduced air travel demand beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and through 2021. 
In June 2021, the State of Hawai'i Safe Travels Program was updated to remove restrictions on travel within the state of Hawai'i, and to permit travelers who were fully vaccinated in the state of Hawai'i to bypass testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when traveling into the state. In July 2021, all U.S. domestic travelers who were fully vaccinated in the United States also were permitted to bypass pre-travel testing or quarantine requirements with proof of vaccination when entering the state starting the 15th day following completion of their vaccination. In September 2021, both the City and County 
of Honolulu and the County of Maui enacted programs that impose certain vaccination and testing requirements on employees and customers of restaurants, bars, gyms and other similar establishments, with limited exceptions.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, along with the easing of restrictions in various locations, led to improved travel demand during 2021; however, our passenger revenue was down approximately 47.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2019. Restrictions on travel to and from various international locations (including those within our network) remain in effect, continuing to suppress international travel demand, with revenue down 89.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2019. We have continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, building back our network where demand allowed, predominantly within our domestic network, while preparing for the return of other markets as restrictions ease. During 2021, we increased capacity (as measured in available seat miles, or ASMs) by approximately 91.5% as compared to 2020; however, capacity in 2021 was down approximately 57.6% as compared to 2019. 
During 2021, our domestic network accounted for approximately 94% of total passenger revenue. We continue to monitor developments relating to restrictions on international travel by both the U.S. and international governments, including by the government of Japan, which represents a large percentage of our international revenue. The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, continues to impact the rules and regulations governing international travel. In December 2021, President Biden announced that all international travelers aged two and older, regardless of nationality or vaccination status, are required to show documentation of a negative viral test result taken within one day of the flight's departure to the United States.
Despite the easing of restrictions on travel to and within Hawai'i, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of vaccination-related travel requirements and increased vaccination availability and uptake on the demand for air travel, including the availability, reliability and effectiveness of vaccines domestically and worldwide, particularly as new variants of the COVID-19 virus have emerged and spread. There can be no assurance whether, at some point, the State of Hawai'i or counties within the state may limit or suspend the ability for travelers to bypass quarantine requirements should the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic worsen. The U.S. government and international governments could also impose, extend or otherwise modify existing travel restrictions on international travel. Additionally, ongoing restrictions or shortages in other sectors of the travel industry, such as hotel or transportation availability, including as a result of vaccination requirements and any associated labor shortages, could negatively impact our operations and affect our ability to satisfy any increased demand we experience. As a result of the above factors and our results to date, we expect bookings, revenue and results of operations in 2022 to continue to be below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Unpredictability in the demand for air travel as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in decreases to existing or anticipated levels of demand, and such decreases could be material to our business. We will continue to assess our routes and schedule in response to changes in demand, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Flight Operations
Our flight operations are based in Honolulu, Hawai'i. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced system capacity in early 2020 to a level that maintained essential services to align capacity with expected demand. As we have evolved through the pandemic, we have increased domestic capacity to match improved demand, predominantly within our North America network. During this time, and primarily as a result of continued restrictions on international travel, we operated a minimal International network well below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 216 scheduled flights with:
•Daily service on our North America routes between the state of Hawai'i and Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Ontario, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; and New York City, New York; and scheduled service between the state of Hawai'i and Austin, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; Orlando, Florida; and Pago Pago, American Samoa.
•Daily service on our Neighbor Island routes among the four major islands of the state of Hawai'i.
•Scheduled service on our International routes between the state of Hawai'i and Tokyo (Narita), Japan and Osaka, Japan, Sydney, Australia; Papeete, Tahiti; and Seoul, South Korea.
•In addition, we operate various ad hoc charters.
As of December 31, 2021, the following international destinations remain suspended and have not resumed service:
•Service between the state of Hawai'i and Sapporo, Japan, Fukuoka, Japan, Tokyo (Haneda), Japan; and Auckland, New Zealand.
In January 2022, we announced the indefinite suspension of our service to Brisbane, Australia. However, we continue to operate our five-times-weekly service to Sydney, Australia and maintain our code-share partnership with Virgin Australia. 
Fuel
Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs:
Year | Gallonsconsumed | Total cost,including taxes | | Average costper gallon | Percent ofoperating expenses
 | (in thousands) | | | 
2021 | 179,494 | | $ | 363,003 | | $ | 2.02 | 21.6 | %
2020 | 106,225 | | $ | 161,363 | | $ | 1.52 | 10.8 | %
2019 | 270,001 | | $ | 542,573 | | $ | 2.01 | 21.7 | %

As illustrated by the table above, fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our operating expenses. We purchase aircraft fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices by entering into various derivative financial instruments.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our aircraft maintenance programs consist of a series of phased or continuous checks for each aircraft type. These checks are performed at specified intervals measured by calendar months, time flown, and by the number of takeoffs and landings, or cycles operated. In addition, we perform inspections, repairs, and modifications of our aircraft in response to FAA directives. We perform checks ranging from "walk around" inspections by our pilots before each flight's departure to major overhauls of the airframes which can take several weeks to complete. Aircraft engines are subject to phased maintenance programs designed to detect and remedy potential problems before they occur. Certain airframe and engine parts and components, whose service lives are time or cycle controlled, are replaced or refurbished prior to the expiration of their time or cycle limits. We have contracts with third parties to provide certain maintenance on our aircraft and aircraft engines.
Marketing and Ticket Distribution
We utilize various distribution channels for marketing and ticket distribution including our website www.hawaiianairlines.com, (primarily for our North America and Neighbor Island routes) and travel agencies and wholesale distributors (primarily for our International routes).
Our website is available in English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese and offers our customers information on our flight schedules and status, information on our HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program, the ability to book reservations on our flights or connecting flights with any of our code-share partners, and the ability to purchase hotel, car and vacation packages. We also distribute our fares through online travel agencies. 
Frequent Flyer Program
The HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program was founded in 1983 predominantly serving the intra-Hawai'i markets. The HawaiianMiles program has continued to grow over the years, with approximately 10 million total members across Hawai'i, North America and the Pacific Rim as of December 2021. Approximately 62% of frequent flyer program members reside in the U.S. mainland, approximately 24% of loyalty members reside in Hawai'i, and the remainder reside within our international markets. 
The HawaiianMiles program awards miles based on customer flight miles, providing more generous earning potential on competitive longer haul routes between the U.S. mainland and international cities and Hawai'i. Our members generate approximately 42% of all passenger revenue. Our Pualani Gold and Platinum status levels recognize our top fliers with additional benefits such as priority airport experiences, Premier Club access, seat upgrades and enhanced baggage allowances. Our Platinum members both fly more frequently and generate a revenue premium of approximately 55% as compared to non-members on our North American and International routes. 
With a large Hawai'i-based route network, our program has developed an extensive network of partnerships with leading local companies that allow members to earn miles beyond their flight activity. Partnerships in key spend categories such as grocery, retail, dining, banking and home improvement provide opportunities for member engagement and third-party revenues.
Hawaiian's partnerships with Barclays, Bank of Hawaii and Mastercard to deliver key products are drivers of engagement and revenues. The HawaiianMiles program has over a half-million cardholders between the Barclays' issued World Elite Mastercard and the Bank of Hawaii VISA debit card. These products allow members to accumulate more miles between their trips on Hawaiian and are critical engagement tools for not only the loyalty program, but also the airline.
The number of free travel awards used for travel on Hawaiian was approximately 496,000 in 2021. The number of free travel awards as a percentage of total revenue passengers was approximately 8% and 5% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe displacement of revenue passengers by passengers using free travel awards is minimal due to our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total revenue passengers.
Enhancing our loyalty offering, for HawaiianMiles members who do not reach Pualani elite status, we offer our Premier Club subscription program. Launched over 30 years ago, our subscription service allows members to enjoy free baggage, access to airport clubs, priority check-in and other value adds. With an annual rate currently between $249 to $299, Hawaiian is able to generate ancillary revenues while helping to keep future customer purchases on Hawaiian flights. 
In April 2021, the Company announced the termination of its HawaiianMiles expiration policy, effective April 1, 2021. Prior to April 1, 2021, accounts with no activity (miles earned or redeemed) for 18 months automatically expired.
Code-Share and Other Alliances
We have marketing alliances with other airlines to offer connecting services, as well as frequent flier program relationships that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges, and code-shares on certain flights. These programs enhance our revenue opportunities by:
•increasing value to our customers by providing easier access to more travel destinations and better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities;
•giving customers access to more connecting flights from other airlines; and
•providing our members and members of our alliance partners' frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on our system while earning mileage credit in the alliance partners' programs.
Our marketing alliances with other airlines as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:

Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are:
•Fares;
•Flight frequency and schedule;
•Customer service;
•On-time performance and reliability;
•Name recognition;
•Marketing affiliations;
•Frequent flyer benefits;
•Aircraft type;
•Change fee waivers;
•Safety record; and
•In-flight services.
Domestic—We face multiple competitors on our North America routes including major network carriers such as Alaska (AS), American Airlines (AA), United Airlines (UA), Delta Airlines (DL), and Southwest Airlines (WN). Various charter companies 
also provide non-scheduled service to Hawai'i, mostly under public charter arrangements. Our Neighbor Island competitors consist of interisland carriers, which include Mokulele Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and a number of other "air taxi" companies.
International—Although certain of these routes were temporarily suspended as of December 31, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are the only provider of direct service between Honolulu and each of Sapporo, Japan; Fukuoka, Japan; Pago Pago, American Samoa; and Papeete, Tahiti. However, we face multiple competitors from both domestic and foreign carriers on our other international routes.
Employees and Human Capital Management
Our workforce drives our success. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 6,674 active employees, of whom approximately 82.3% were covered by labor agreements with the following organized labor groups:
Employee Group | Represented by | Number of Employees | Agreement amendable on (*)
Flight deck crew members | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 841 | | July 1, 2022 
Cabin crew members | Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) | 2,070 | | April 2, 2025 
Maintenance and engineering personnel | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM-M) | 965 | | January 1, 2021
Clerical | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - Clerical Division (IAM-C) | 1,563 | | January 1, 2021
Flight dispatch personnel | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 56 | | July 22, 2021 

* Our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees are governed by the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (the Railway Labor Act). Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between us and the labor unions does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
In January 2022, we reached a tentative agreement on terms of a new collective bargaining agreement with representatives of our IAM-M and IAM-C employees, which will be submitted for a ratification vote in February 2022. Additionally, we are in discussions with representatives of our TWU employees regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreement.
Engagement, Community and Culture 
We recognize the importance of having an engaged workforce and seek to retain our employees through competitive compensation and benefits packages and by investing in training, mentoring, and career development.
We engage with our employees through various channels and initiatives, including via our Nā Leo (Our Voice) survey, a regular confidential employee survey that helps measure employee engagement. We review survey feedback with our management, Board of Directors, and company-wide, and we use our findings to help inform decision-making and drive improvements within the company. 
We also understand that our commitment to our workforce extends to the communities of which both we and they are a part. We have several internship programs in which we train and recruit local candidates who are interested in pursuing a career with us. For those interested in working as an aviation mechanic, we partner with Honolulu Community College and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union. For those interested in working in information technology or another of our corporate workgroups, we offer paid summer internships at our Honolulu headquarters and Phoenix, AZ office.
Health, Wellness and COVID-19 Support
We offer our employees a variety of comprehensive medical plans and options, including dental, vision, long-term disability and life insurance, and healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted a comprehensive COVID-19 Safety Policy for our workplaces and employees that includes a vaccination requirement for U.S. employees. We have adopted flexible work options for our management employees, such as the ability to work remotely from anywhere for up to two weeks per year to help them better manage their work and personal lives. To help our employees 
manage personal and financial challenges that may have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered counseling services and special loan and 401(k) programs.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our diversity efforts include participation in career events and conferences for veterans, people with disabilities, women, and underrepresented groups. In 2021, we were proud to lead the U.S. industry with the highest percentage of women pilots at more than 9%; well above the 2020 global average of 5.1%. We have implemented and maintain an affirmative action program and employ evidence-based processes that inform our effort to minimize gender, ethnic/racial, and other bias in hiring and promotional practices. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where our applicants and employees feel comfortable self-identifying their gender, race, and veteran and disability status. More than 75% of our active workforce identify as diverse based on ethnicity and more than 45% based on gender. We have policies that support inclusion of everyone in our workforce, including all sexual orientations and gender identities or expressions, and we provide inclusive benefits for same- and different-sex spouses. We also support the diversity and interests of our workforce through the following employee resource groups: ASCEND (A Support Community for Employees Nurturing Diverse Abilities), LGBTQA, Network for Black Employees and Allies, Sustainability, Wahine (Women) in Aviation and Veterans. 
We take pride in and value the traditional culture of Hawai'i. In 2019, we expanded our 'ōlelo Hawai'i (Hawaiian language) certification program for crewmembers and made it available for all employees. The certification, which is offered at no cost to our employees, demonstrates our commitment to honor and perpetuate Hawai'i’s rich culture by incentivizing our team members to share Hawai'i’s native language with our guests and each other. The 'ōlelo Hawai'i program complements our Ke Kumu project, which consists of employee-led hula and Hawaiian language classes.
Seasonality
Hawai'i is a popular vacation destination for travelers. For that reason, our operations and financial results are subject to substantial seasonal and cyclical volatility, primarily due to leisure and holiday travel patterns. Demand levels are typically weaker in the first quarter of the year with stronger demand periods occurring during the months of June, July, August, and December. We may adjust our pricing or the availability of particular fares to obtain an optimal passenger load factor depending on seasonal demand differences.
Customers
Our business is not dependent upon any single type of customer or groups of customers and the loss of any one type of customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
We have entered into agreements with our co-brand, payment, and loyalty partners that may contain exclusivity aspects which restrict us and our subsidiaries from entering into certain arrangements with other payment and loyalty partners. These arrangements generally extend for the terms of the agreements. We believe the financial benefits generated by the exclusivity aspects of these arrangements outweigh the limitations imposed under such agreements.
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive and evolving international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Many governmental agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Governmental authorities can enforce compliance with applicable laws and regulations and obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties or modify, suspend, or revoke our operating certificates in case of violations.
Industry Regulations
We are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT and the FAA. The DOT has jurisdiction over international routes and fares for some countries (based upon treaty relations with those countries), consumer protection policies including baggage liability, denied boarding compensation, and unfair competitive practices as set forth in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight operations, including equipment, ground facilities, security systems, maintenance, and other safety matters. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of our aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls.
Maintenance Directives
The FAA approves all airline maintenance programs and modifications to such programs. In addition, the FAA certifies and licenses the air carrier, mechanics, inspectors, and repair stations that perform inspections, repairs and overhauls.
The FAA frequently issues airworthiness directives in response to specific incidents or reports by operators or manufacturers, mandating operators of specified equipment types to perform prescribed inspections, repairs or modifications within stated time periods and/or aircraft hours and cycles. 
Airport Security
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandates that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provide screening of all passengers and property, including mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. Under the ATSA, substantially all security screeners at airports are federal employees and airline and airport security is overseen and performed by federal employees, including security managers, law enforcement officers, and Federal Air Marshals. The ATSA also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft (and requires Federal Air Marshals to be present on certain flights), improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and enhanced background checks.
The TSA also has the authority to impose additional fees on air carriers, if necessary, to cover additional federal aviation security costs. 
Environmental and Employee Safety and Health
We are subject to various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business. Many aspects of airlines' operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign laws protecting the environment. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Certain of our operations are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that affect our operations. In addition to these federal activities, states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements, such as California.
The EPA is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Our aircraft comply with the existing EPA standards, as applicable, by engine design date.
We seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts. We have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain aircraft in our fleet with newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. We are also supporting initiatives to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S. as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment.
Noise Abatement
Under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, the DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate and foreign commerce, or the national transportation system. Certain airports, including the major airports at Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations. Local authorities at other airports could consider adopting similar noise restrictions. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increases in operating costs, and such restrictions could limit our ability to expand our operations and reduce our profitability.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
The U.S. Department of Defense regulates the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and government charters. We have elected to participate in the CRAF program by agreeing to make aircraft available to the federal government for use by the U.S. military under certain stages of readiness related to national emergencies. The program is a standby arrangement that allows the U.S. Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command to call on as many as 12 contractually committed Hawaiian aircraft and crews to supplement military airlift capabilities. In August 2021, we were called upon and activated two aircraft under the 
CRAF program for Stage 1 activation as defined under the program, which was completed in September 2021. As of December 31, 2021, none of our aircraft are presently mobilized under this program. 
Other Regulations
The state of Hawai'i is uniquely dependent upon air transportation. The Hawai'i state legislature has enacted legislation that addresses this concern. 
Other aspects of airline operations are subject to regulation or oversight by federal agencies other than the FAA and the DOT. Federal antitrust laws are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services provided by our cargo services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act. We and other airlines certificated prior to October 24, 1978 are also subject to preferential hiring rights granted by the Airline Deregulation Act to certain airline employees who have been furloughed or terminated (other than for cause). The Federal Communications Commission issues licenses and regulates the use of all communications frequencies assigned to us and other airlines. There is increased focus on consumer protection both on the federal and state level. We cannot always accurately predict the cost of such requirements on our operations.
Additional laws and regulations are proposed from time to time, which could significantly increase the cost of airline operations by imposing additional requirements or restrictions. U.S. law restricts the ownership of U.S. airlines to corporations where no more than 25% of the voting stock may be held by non-U.S. citizens and the airline must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. The President and two thirds of the Board of Directors and other managing officers must also be U.S. citizens. Regulations also have been considered from time to time that would prohibit or restrict the ownership and/or transfer of airline routes or takeoff and landing slots and authorizations. Also, the award of international routes to U.S. carriers (and their retention) is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, which are amended from time to time. We cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or what changes to international air transportation treaties will be adopted, if any, or how we will be affected by those changes.
