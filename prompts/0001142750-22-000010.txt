Overview of Our Company and Business Strategy
AMN Healthcare empowers the future of care through the nation’s largest network of quality healthcare professionals. As the leader and innovator in total talent solutions for the healthcare sector in the United States, we tailor our solutions to our clients’ challenges and goals, and provide staffing, talent optimization strategies, and technology solutions aimed to support caregivers and improve patient outcomes. We are passionate about all aspects of our mission to:
•Deliver the right talent and insights to help healthcare organizations optimize their workforce.
•Provide healthcare professionals opportunities to do their best work toward high-quality patient care.
•Create a values-based culture of innovation in which our team members can achieve their goals. 
Our solutions enable our clients to optimize their workforce, simplify staffing complexity, increase efficiency and elevate the patient experience. Our comprehensive suite of talent solutions provides management, staffing, recruitment, language services, technology, telehealth and virtual care management, analytics, and related services to build and manage all or part of our clients’ healthcare workforce needs. We offer temporary, project, and permanent career opportunities to our healthcare professionals, from nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals to healthcare leaders and executives in a variety of settings across the nation to help them achieve their personal and professional goals.
Our strategy is designed to support growth in the number and size of customer relationships and expansion of the markets we serve. Driving increased adoption of our existing talent solutions through cross-selling will deepen and broaden our customer relationships. We will continue to innovate, develop and invest in new, complementary service and technology solutions that optimize and manage our clients’ workforce, enhance the patient experience, better engage our talent network and expand into different healthcare delivery settings. We expect this will enable us expand our strategic customer relationships, while driving more recurring revenue, with an improved margin mix that will be less sensitive to economic cycles.

Over the past decade, our business has evolved beyond traditional healthcare staffing and recruitment services; we have become a strategic total talent solutions partner with our clients. We expanded our portfolio to serve a diverse and growing set of healthcare talent-related needs. In addition to our healthcare professional staffing and recruitment services, our suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes managed services programs (“MSP”), vendor management systems (“VMS”), medical language interpretation services, predictive labor analytics, workforce optimization technology and consulting, clinical labor scheduling, recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”), revenue cycle solutions, credentialing software services, and virtual care management services. We enable clients to build, manage and optimize their healthcare talent to deliver great patient outcomes and experience. Our talent network includes thousands of highly skilled, experienced professionals who trust us to place them in environments that expand and leverage their qualifications and expertise.
When developing and acquiring talent solutions, both services and technology, we consider many important criteria: (1) identifying and addressing the most pressing current and future needs of our clients and talent network; (2) alignment with our core operations, expertise, and access to healthcare professionals; (3) ways to deepen and broaden our client and healthcare professional relationships; (4) talent and technology solutions that expand the markets we serve; (5) businesses that reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles and enhance our profitability; and (6) offerings that differentiate us from competitors. 
Continuous improvement of our operations and business technology is a core component of our growth strategy and profitability goals. We have accelerated the integration of technology-based solutions in our core recruitment processes through investment in digital capabilities, mobile applications and data analytics. These innovations provide a more seamless and efficient workflow for our team members, our healthcare professionals and our clients. For example, we implemented a new platform for our websites that significantly enhanced navigation and ease for our healthcare professionals to submit applications to work for us which is important in this high demand/tight supply environment. We also launched the AMN Passport mobile application and throughout 2021 we continued to add functionality. AMN Passport provides a centralized experience for nurses and allied professionals to find, book and manage assignments, access time and pay details, and receive instantaneous alerts and updates, while also creating operational efficiencies through the ability to customize job preferences, store and manage credentials, electronically sign important documents and contact our dedicated recruiters. Our investments in technology systems will help us realize greater scale, agility, and cost efficiencies.
Human Capital Management

Providing total talent solutions to our clients is our primary source of revenue generation, so development of a broad base of healthcare professionals and corporate team members who feel valued, respected and supported is essential to drive shareholder value and achieve our long-term growth objectives. To support these objectives, our human capital management strategy generally focuses on talent recruitment, engagement and retention, diversity, equity, equality and inclusion, and employee health and safety. The central components of our human capital management strategy and infrastructure are described in more detail in this section below. 
The strength of our human capital management infrastructure and strategy was also instrumental to our COVID-19 response in 2020 and 2021. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the Company and its teams worked quickly to assess the impact of the pandemic on our team members, healthcare professionals, communities, clients and their patients and took immediate action to mitigate the risks to all stakeholders. Throughout the pandemic, caring for the well-being of our team members and healthcare professionals has been a primary focus. We are working hard every day to ensure that all of our team members and healthcare professionals have the resources available to help them navigate the continued challenges and stresses associated with the pandemic.
The care, support and safety of our frontline healthcare professionals was and remains at the forefront for us. We have provided our healthcare professionals with additional support from our corporate clinical staff, access to employee assistance programs, on demand mental health resources through non-profit partners and third-party vendors, sick pay while quarantined and other numerous other outreach efforts, wellness products and services to care for them while they are caring for our communities. In 2021, our roughly 60 clinician team members placed over 10,000 care calls to our healthcare professionals. As the country dealt with the Omicron variant, we exceeded 5,000 care calls during January 2022.
To provide this support to our healthcare professionals, we quickly and effectively moved our corporate team members to a fully remote work environment in March 2020, and the vast majority of our corporate team members continue to work remotely. Our team members have continued to support our clients and healthcare professionals with the highest level of service from their home offices without a disruption in our business operations. We provided our team members with stipends and other resources in 2020 and 2021 to establish their new working environments.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,800 corporate team members, which includes both full-time and part-time. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we had an average of (1) 14,827 nurses, allied and other healthcare professionals, (2) 459 executive and clinical leadership interim staff, and (3) 1,469 medically qualified interpreters working for us. This does not include independent contractors, such as our locum tenens and contract interpreters, who were not our employees in 2021.
Health and Safety


Aware of the toll that the pandemic has taken on our team members, we expanded our employee assistance program to provide additional mental health resources. The health and safety of our team members has and remains paramount as we formulate our plans to return to an office environment. When we do return to our offices, the future of work will look different than it did prior to the pandemic and most of our team members will work in a virtual environment most of the time. We believe it is important to bring our teams together to instill and reinforce our values-based culture, provide an opportunity to build meaningful connections with each other and our communities and provide professional development and training opportunities. Our team members are dispersed across the country, and we have offices in Dallas, TX, San Diego, CA, Omaha, NE, Boca Raton and Clearwater, FL, Savannah, GA and Hickory, NC.
Learning and Professional Development

Although operating in a virtual environment, we have continued to make significant investments in our professional development programs that allow team members to grow their careers at AMN. Throughout 2021, more than 1,100 team members were promoted or transferred internally into new positions, representing greater than 30% of the opportunities available. We offer leadership development curriculums led by our team of learning and talent development professionals for new leaders, called LEAD at AMN, as well as a leadership curriculum for our individual contributors who are seeking leadership positions, which we call our emerging leaders program. These programs are supplemented with professional development resources from third-party vendors and our corporate memberships in large industry associations, to which every team member has access. Additionally, our training and development programs include curriculum that promotes and nurtures our values-based culture and commitment to ethics, compliance and diversity, and equity and inclusion (as detailed more specifically below). To that end, substantially all of our people leaders completed our inclusive leaders curriculum and, in 2021, we had a 95% completion rate for our ethics and compliance training program, which includes, but is not limited to, training on our Code of Conduct, harassment prevention and cybersecurity. We also offer tuition assistance to team members pursuing education to further their development in their present position or for future possible positions.
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion

At AMN, our diversity, equality and inclusion philosophy is grounded in the belief that we should respect all voices, seek diverse perspectives, and succeed when we act together as a positive force for all of humanity. We have the opportunity to make an impact on each other, our industry, and other communities by fostering a diverse team with a passion for social justice and equity. We are committed to actively engaging in building an organization and society where equality is the norm, equity is achieved, and inclusion is universal so that we may all thrive. This extends to our compensation philosophy which reflects our commitment to equal pay principles and our leadership development strategy, which values diversity in identifying high potential talent within the Company.
We believe that our diverse workforce, and inclusive environment drives the innovation and better outcomes that have made us the leader in total talent solutions. While the diverse backgrounds and experiences we seek are broad, here is a snapshot of some of the diversity of our corporate team members as of January 2022: 67% of our team members are women; 60% of our supervisor through senior manager roles are held by women; 56% of our board of directors are women; 36% of our team members are people of color; 25% of our leadership roles are held by people of color; our team is 57% Millennials, 33% Generation X, 7% Baby Boomers, and 3% Generation Z; and team members self-identified as veterans, disabled, and LGBTQ+, each representing approximately 2% to 3% of our team. Each of the last five years, AMN has been named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. AMN also received a top ranking – 95 out of 100 – in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index in each of the last four years. We believe that human capital management infrastructure, including our diversity, equality and inclusion program and commitment to equal pay principles, is fundamental to our continued recognition as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies in each of the last three years.
Team Member Communication and Engagement

Team member engagement and wellness is of critical importance to our success. In 2021, we prioritized engaging with our team members through live virtual question and answers sessions on a monthly basis, through AMN Live and “Ask Susan” as well as other town halls throughout the year with our chief executive officer and other senior executives. We modified our time off policy to provide more flexibility for team members to take the holidays that they wish to celebrate through floating holidays.
In addition, in 2021, we continued focusing our attention and efforts on increasing engagement through our growing number of employee resource groups. Best practice research indicates that team member engagement and retention is positively impacted if team members are connected to like-minded peers and leaders. We believe we have invested into and dedicated appropriate resources to build an inclusive infrastructure of employee resource groups that closely aligns with the diverse interests and backgrounds of our team members. As of December 31, 2021, we increased the number of employee resource groups to eight and approximately 25% of our corporate team members are now members of at least one resource group. Each of our employee resource groups is sponsored by members of our executive team.

To assess the engagement of our team members and take action to mitigate risks associated with workforce engagement, development and retention, we historically conducted an annual survey to assess the engagement of our team members. While the format of our annual survey varies from year to year to best capture different measures of employee engagement, the results of each assessment are discussed with our board of directors, and are incorporated into our annual human capital management strategic planning process. After a pandemic-induced pause, we are relaunching this survey in February 2022. We continue to monitor employee turnover as part of our human capital strategy.
Our Services

In 2021, we conducted our business through three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) physician and leadership solutions, and (3) technology and workforce solutions. We describe each segment’s revenue and operating results under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” Our go-to-market strategy blends solutions from all three reportable segments, combining staffing, talent planning and acquisition, and technology-enabled solutions.
Workforce Staffing

(1) Nurse Staffing. We offer a range of specialty recruitment and temporary assignment lengths for nursing. A rigorous quality process ensures that each nursing candidate possesses the necessary training, licensure, and clinical competencies needed for a client facility.
•Travel Nurses – Covering all nurse specialties and settings, our nurses typically travel for a 13-week assignment but can support a range of 8 to 26 weeks. Other travel nurse staffing solutions that we offer include (a) international nursing for which we recruit registered nurses from outside of the United States, typically on long-term contracts ranging from 24 to 36 months, (b) crisis nursing (commonly referred to as critical staffing and rapid response nursing) for which we quickly coordinate and deploy registered nurses to provide temporary assistance during critical periods such as unexpected specialty gaps and urgent needs, including pandemic surges, natural disasters and other emergency situations, and (c) labor disruption staffing for which we provide crucial support for clients involved in strikes of nurses and allied professional staff.
•Local, or Per Diem, Staffing – Often in support of our MSP clients, we provide our clients local staffing of all nursing specialties, covering short-term assignments with same-day shifts that potentially last for several weeks. Local staffing includes digital staffing technology to quickly fill our client’s needs with healthcare professionals that are local to the community.
(2) Allied Staffing. We provide allied health professionals to acute-care hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation clinics, schools, and pharmacies. Allied health professionals include such disciplines as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, medical and radiology technologists, lab technicians, speech pathologists, rehabilitation assistants and pharmacists. Our solutions for schools feature an advanced teletherapy platform, Televate, and the nations’ top school speech-language pathologists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and other care providers who provide customized care and interactive learning plans to engage students.
(3) Revenue Cycle Solutions. As the leading national provider of mid-revenue cycle solutions, we understand the need for hospitals, health systems, acute care facilities and large physician practices to generate and preserve revenue. We provide skilled labor solutions for remote medical coding, clinical documentation improvement, case management, and clinical data registry, and also provide auditing and advisory services.
(4) Physician and Advanced Practice Staffing. We provide locum tenens physician staffing services, offering clients thousands of physicians of all specialties, advanced practice and other clinicians. Typically on an independent contractor basis, locum tenens professionals are placed on temporary assignments with all types of healthcare organizations throughout the United States, including hospitals, health systems, medical groups, occupational medical clinics, psychiatric facilities, government institutions and insurance companies. We also offer full-service, permanent physician search across many specialties and modalities, specializing in recruiting and placing top physicians and advanced practitioner talent in jobs across the country.
(5) Interim Leadership Staffing. We provide executive and clinical leadership interim staffing. Practice areas include senior healthcare executives, physician executives, chief nursing officers and other clinical and operational leaders. Interim leaders provide strategic guidance and assist in setting short and long-term goals to offer immediate support, maintain momentum, and contribute leading practices and perspectives. Our interim leaders enjoy the flexibility of a consulting role with the stability of full-time employment.
(6)  Executive Search and Academic Leadership. We provide executive leadership search services across the healthcare industry with areas of focus including academic medical centers and children’s hospitals nationwide. This business 

line provides us greater access to the “C-suite” of our clients and prospective clients, which we believe helps improve our visibility as a strategic partner to them and helps provide us with cross-selling opportunities.
Talent Planning & Acquisition

(7)  Managed Services Programs. Many of our clients and prospective clients use a number of healthcare staffing agencies to fulfill their healthcare professional needs. We offer a comprehensive managed services program, in which we manage all or a portion of a client’s contingent staffing needs. This service includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the client’s contingent staffing needs. We believe an MSP optimizes our clients’ staffing models, increasing efficiencies and often providing cost savings while enhancing the patient experience. We often use our own VMS technology as part of our MSP, which we believe further enhances the value of our service offering. In 2021, we had approximately $3.4 billion in gross billings under management under our MSPs and approximately 56% of our consolidated revenue flowed through MSP relationships, which has steadily increased over the past decade.
(8)  Recruitment Solutions. We partner with clients to streamline their permanent workforce planning and recruitment process through one efficient, agile solution. Our recruitment solutions, which many refer to as RPO, are customized to the client’s particular needs, in which we recruit, hire and/or onboard permanent clinical and nonclinical positions on their behalf. We provide technology and data intelligence that enable sustainable, long-term improvement and offer flexible solution options, agile, scalable processes in our pay-for-performance model.
Technology

(9)  Language Interpretation. Through our acquisition of Stratus Video, our AMN Language Services division provides healthcare interpretation services via proprietary platforms that enable video remote interpretation, over the phone interpretation, onsite interpretation, and telehealth interoperability, with more than 200 health systems, more than 2,000 hospitals, and thousands of clinics using our solutions. These services are all supported by proprietary technology platforms, which enable real-time routing of video and audio calls, drive client efficiency with an in-person scheduling mobile application, and power interoperability with multiple telehealth platforms.
(10) Vendor Management Systems. Some clients and prospective clients prefer a vendor-neutral VMS technology that allows them to self-manage procurement of contingent clinical labor and their internal float pool. If clients use other staffing companies (associate vendors), our software as a service (“SaaS”)-based VMS technologies help them track and efficiently organize their staffing process. Our current VMS products are ShiftWise, Medefis and b4health. Our VMS technologies provide, among other things, control over a wide variety of tasks via a single system and consolidated reporting. In 2021, we had approximately $4.0 billion in gross billings flow through our VMS programs, for which we typically earn a 4-5% fee.
(11) Scheduling and Staff Planning. We offer Smart Square, healthcare scheduling software that combines demand forecasting (predictive analytics) with robust scheduling functionality, enterprise transparency, patented open shift management, and business intelligence tools all-in-one application. The SaaS platform provides fast implementations and is utilized in acute care, clinics, ancillary, long-term care and senior care settings.
(12) Credentialing. We provide an all-in-one credentialing solution, Silversheet, to help our clients maintain a healthy and compliant facility. This software solution is designed to help facilities credential smarter and faster through automating tedious tasks, preventing errors, and centralized credentialing.
(13) Post Acute and Home Health. Through our acquisition of Synzi, we provide the only comprehensive end-to-end solution that enables regional and community hospitals, multi-practice physician groups, retail and urgent care clinics, and behavioral health practices to deliver virtual care via a single platform. The easy-to-use HIPAA-compliant platform expands our capabilities with a “platform-plus-providers” experience that helps healthcare organizations provide 24/7 patient care (including after hours and weekend support) and remote patient monitoring virtually. The white-labeling feature enables an organization’s brand to be showcased on the virtual care platform, boosting patient awareness and engagement.
We typically experience modest seasonal fluctuations during our fiscal year, and they tend to vary among our business segments. These fluctuations can vary slightly in intensity from year to year.
Our Healthcare Professionals

The recruitment of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work on temporary assignments and for placement at healthcare organizations is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position.
We recruit our healthcare professionals, depending on the particular service line, under the following brands: American Mobile, Nursefinders, NurseChoice, HealthSource Global Staffing, Onward Healthcare, O’Grady Peyton International, Med Travelers, Club Staffing, Staff Care, B.E. Smith, Merritt Hawkins, AMN Revenue Cycle Solutions and AMN Language Services. Our multi-brand recruiting strategy is supported by innovative and effective marketing programs that focus on lead management, including our digital presence on websites, social media, and mobile applications. Word-of-mouth referrals from the thousands of current and former healthcare professionals we have placed enhance our effectiveness at reaching healthcare professionals.
Our process to attract and retain healthcare professionals for temporary assignments and permanent placement depends on (1) offering a large selection of assignments and placements in a variety of geographies and settings with opportunities for career development, (2) creating competitive compensation packages, (3) developing passionate, knowledgeable recruiters and service professionals who understand the needs of our healthcare professionals and provide a personalized approach, and (4) maintaining a reputation for service excellence. The attractive compensation package that we provide our temporary healthcare professionals includes a competitive wage, professional development opportunities, professional liability insurance, 401(k) plan and health insurance.
Our Geographic Markets and Client Base

During each of the past three years, (1) we generated substantially all of our revenue in the United States and (2) substantially all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. We typically generate revenue in all 50 states. During 2021, the largest percentages of our revenue were concentrated in California, New York and Texas. 
More than half of our temporary and contract healthcare professional assignments occur at acute-care hospitals. In addition to acute-care hospitals, we provide services to sub-acute healthcare facilities, physician groups, rehabilitation centers, schools, home health service providers and ambulatory surgery centers. Our clients include many of the largest and most prestigious and progressive health care systems in the country. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (and its affiliates), to whom we provide clinical managed services, comprised approximately 17% of our consolidated revenue and 20% of our nurse and allied solutions segment revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. No other client healthcare system or single client facility comprised more than 5% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Our Industry

The primary markets in which we compete are U.S. temporary and contract healthcare staffing, workforce solutions and executive search. Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) estimates the size of the healthcare staffing market in 2021 at $24.7 billion, including travel nurse ($11.8 billion), per diem nurse ($4.6 billion), locum tenens ($4.0 billion) and allied healthcare ($4.4 billion). We also operate within the interim leadership, executive search, physician permanent placement, RPO, VMS, revenue cycle solutions, telehealth technology, and workforce optimization and consulting services markets. We estimate the size of these additional markets to be at least $6.0 billion in 2021.
Industry Demand Drivers

Many factors affect the demand for contingent and permanent healthcare talent, which, accordingly, affects the size of the markets in which we primarily operate. Of these many factors, we believe the following serve as some of the most significant drivers of demand.

•Economic Environment and Employment Rate. Demand for our services is affected by growth of the U.S. economy, which influences the employment rate. Growth in real U.S. gross domestic product generally drives rising employment rates. Favorable macro drivers typically result in increased demand for our services. Generally, we believe a positive economic environment and growing employment lead to increasing demand for healthcare services. As employment levels rise, healthcare facilities, like employers in many industries, experience higher levels of employee attrition and find it increasingly difficult to obtain and retain permanent staff.

•Supply of Healthcare Professionals. While reports differ on the existence and extent of current and future healthcare professional shortages, many regions of the United States are experiencing a shortage of physicians and nurses that we believe will persist in the future. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the physician shortage is expected to be approximately 139,000 physicians by 2033. In nursing, regional and specialty-based shortages are also expected by 2032, and we believe have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic through nurse burnout, attrition, retirements, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of mandatory vaccination requirements. Demand for our services is positively correlated with activity in the permanent labor market. When nurse vacancy rates increase, temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase as well.
•General Demand for Healthcare Services. Changes in demand for healthcare services, particularly at acute healthcare hospitals and other inpatient facilities, like skilled nursing facilities, affect the demand for our services. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured population declined by more than 18 million people between 2010 and 2018. Growth of the insured population contributed to a relatively sharp increase in national healthcare expenditures beginning in 2014. Additionally, the U.S. population continues to age, and medical technology advances are contributing to longer life expectancy. A pronounced shift in U.S. age demographics is expected to boost growth of health expenditures, projected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at a 5.6% annual rate from 2021-2028. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of adults age 65 or older is on pace to grow an estimated 30% between 2020 and 2030. People over 65 are three times more likely to have a hospital stay and twice as likely to visit a physician office compared with the rest of the population. These dynamics could place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide in the coming years. Not only does the age-demographic shift affect healthcare services demand, it also complicates the supply of skilled labor, as an increasing number of clinicians are aging out of the workforce. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in hospitalizations, vaccinations and testing across the country. This additional demand for healthcare services has resulted in an increased demand for our services, especially in our nurse and allied solutions segment. When the pandemic subsides, we expect demand for these services to remain at higher than pre-pandemic levels due to the tight labor market.
•Adoption of Workforce Solutions. We believe healthcare organizations increasingly seek sophisticated, innovative and economically beneficial total talent solutions that improve patient experience and outcomes. We believe the prevalence of workforce solutions, such as MSP, VMS, RPO and workforce optimization tools, in the healthcare industry is still underpenetrated in comparison with non-healthcare sectors. During 2021, approximately 56% of our consolidated revenues were generated through MSP relationships, which we estimate is higher than our competitors.

Industry Competition
The healthcare staffing and workforce solutions industry is highly competitive. We compete in national, regional and local markets for healthcare organization clients and healthcare professionals. We believe that our comprehensive suite of total talent solutions, our commitment to quality and service excellence, our execution capabilities, and our national footprint create a compelling value proposition for our existing and prospective clients that give us distinct, scalable advantages over smaller, local and regional competitors and companies whose solution offerings, sales and execution capabilities are not as robust. The breadth of our talent solutions allows us to provide even greater value through a more strategic and consultative approach to our clients. In addition, we believe that our size, scale and sophisticated candidate acquisition processes give us access to a larger pool of available, high quality candidates than most of our competitors, while substantial word-of-mouth referral networks and recognizable brand names enable us to attract, engage, and grow a diverse, high-quality network of healthcare professionals.
Larger firms, such as us, also generally have a deeper, more comprehensive infrastructure with a more established operating model and processes that provide the long-term stability and foundation for quality standards recognition, such as the Joint Commission staffing agency certification and National Committee for Quality Assurance Credentials Verification Organization certification. HRO Today named AMN Healthcare to the number one position among all MSP providers based on size of deals, and we also were honored in the Baker’s Dozen for quality of services, breadth of services and overall MSP capabilities. Once again, in 2021, Staffing Industry Analysts recognized AMN’s U.S. industry leadership naming us as the largest temporary healthcare staffing firm.
We are the largest provider of nurse and allied healthcare staffing in the United States. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, we compete with a few national competitors together with numerous smaller, regional and local companies. We believe we are the third largest provider of locum tenens staffing services in the United States. The locum tenens staffing market consists of many small- to mid-sized companies with only a relatively small number of national competitors of which we are one. The healthcare interim leadership staffing, healthcare executive search services, and physician permanent placement services markets, where we believe we hold leading positions, are also highly fragmented and consist of many small- to mid-sized companies that do not have a national footprint. We also believe we have a market-leading share in managed services solutions, including VMS and MSP, and healthcare language interpretation services, which is the fastest growing market segment, after our acquisition of Stratus Video. Our leading competitors vary by segment and include CHG Healthcare 

Services, Aya Healthcare, Jackson Healthcare, Medical Solutions, Maxim Healthcare Services, RightSourcing, Cross Country Healthcare, Favorite Healthcare Staffing, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, and WittKieffer. When recruiting for healthcare professionals, in addition to other executive search and staffing firms, we also compete with hospital systems that have developed their own recruitment departments.
Licensure For Our Business

Some states require state licensure for businesses that employ, assign and/or place healthcare professionals. We believe we are currently licensed in all states that require such licenses and take measures to ensure compliance with all state licensure requirements. In addition, the healthcare professionals who we employ or independently contract with are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state laws. We believe we take appropriate and reasonable steps to validate that our healthcare professionals possess all necessary licenses and certifications. We design our internal processes to ensure that the healthcare professionals that we directly place with clients have the appropriate experience, credentials and skills. Our nurse, allied healthcare and locum tenens staffing divisions have received Joint Commission certification. We have also obtained our Credentials Verification Organization certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance.
Government Regulation

We are subject to the laws of the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
