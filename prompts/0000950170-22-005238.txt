ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Stryve is an emerging healthy snacking company which manufactures, markets and sells highly differentiated healthy snacking products that Stryve believes can disrupt traditional snacking categories. Stryve’s mission is “to help Americans snack better and live happier, better lives.” Stryve offers convenient snacks that are lower in sugar and carbohydrates and higher in protein than other snacks. Stryve offers all-natural, delicious snacks which it believes are nutritious and offer consumers a convenient healthy snacking option for their on-the-go lives.
    Stryve’s current product portfolio consists primarily of air-dried meat snack products marketed under the Stryve®, Kalahari®, Braaitime®, and Vacadillos® brand names. Unlike beef jerky, Stryve’s all-natural air-dried meat snack products are made of beef and spices, are never cooked, generally contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of monosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. As a result, Stryve’s products are Keto and Paelo diet friendly. Further, based on protein density and sugar content, Stryve believes that its air-dried meat snack products are some of the healthiest shelf-stable snacks available today.
    Stryve distributes its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club stores and other retail outlets, as well as directly to consumers through its e-commerce websites which officially launched in 2020, as well as direct to consumer through the Amazon platform.
    Stryve believes increased consumer focus in the U.S. on health and wellness will continue to drive growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase demand for Stryve’s products. Stryve has shown strong sales growth since its inception in 2017. Stryve has made substantial investments since its inception in product development, establishing its manufacturing facility, and building its marketing, sales and operations infrastructure to grow its business. Stryve intends to continue to invest in product innovation and acquisition, improving its supply chain, increasing its manufacturing capacity, and expanding its marketing and sales initiatives to continue its growth.
    Stryve’s Strengths
    Aligned with consumer trends. Stryve believes that a number of consumer trends in the U.S. will continue to drive the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase the demand for Stryve’s products. These trends include:
 •greater consumer focus on health and wellness;
 •nutrition guidance which recommends increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day;
 •preference for convenient, “better-for-you” snacks;
 •desire to reduce carbohydrate and sugar consumption; and
 •preference for snacks and other foods without additives or preservatives.



Stryve’s products are aligned with these trends, offering high protein content with limited ingredients, and generally contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of monosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. Stryve believes its products appeal to consumers interested in an active lifestyle who are seeking protein rich, low-carbohydrate snacking options, many of whom do not currently purchase meat snacks. Based on prior studies reviewed by Stryve's management, the Company believes that less than a third of its target consumers, the healthy snack seekers in the United States, had purchased a meat snack in the prior 12 months. Stryve believes that with increased marketing and consumer education, Stryve’s meat products will appeal to healthy snack seekers.
 
Scalable platform with an attractive market opportunity. Stryve has grown its revenues since inception through product and brand development, as well as acquisitions of complementary products. According to Statista, the U.S. healthy snacking market in 2022 is estimated to be approximately $110 billion. Stryve believes that it can leverage its relationships with its retail customers and distributors to launch new products, brands and brand extensions, increase consumer recognition, and continue to expand its healthy snacking platform.
 
Manufacturing capacity to support growth. By manufacturing its products, Stryve believes it can maintain pricing advantages against its competitors, achieve margins that support marketing spend, streamline innovation and new product development, and capitalize on potential private label opportunities. Stryve believes that its recently-constructed, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility can support revenues of up to $100 million with limited additional capital expenditures and is the only facility of scale with a full grant of inspection from the USDA to produce air-dried, never-cooked, shelf-stable meat snack products.
 
Experienced management team. Stryve has built an experienced team of industry veterans with collectively over 50 years of experience across multiple branded consumer product, food and nutrition categories. Stryve’s co-founder and CEO, Joe Oblas, founded ProSupps USA, a sports nutrition brand, and co-founded Juice Stop, a smoothie company. Stryve’s co-founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Stryve, Ted Casey, was the founder and CEO of Dymatize Nutrition, a nutrition supplement company. Alex Hawkins, Stryve’s Chief Financial Officer, has experience acquiring, growing, and exiting businesses as a Principal at Rosewood Private Investments, a private equity firm. Bruce Boettner, Stryve’s Chief Customer Officer, previously served as the head of sales at Kashi, Evolution Fresh, and Humm Kombucha.
 
Data-driven direct-to-consumer business. Stryve has developed a substantial direct-to-consumer business for its brands using an in-house web fulfillment operation. By utilizing a data-driven approach to digital marketing, Stryve believes that it can more accurately target its ideal consumers.
 
Stryve’s Strategy
 
Focus on growing e-commerce. Stryve officially launched its Stryve.com direct-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2020, and has sold its products directly to consumers through Amazon since 2018. Stryve has prioritized e-commerce as a key channel for growth, including international growth. Stryve uses focused targeted digital media to acquire, engage and retain consumers, including newsletters and discounts for initial and repeat consumer orders. E-commerce sales provide Stryve with higher margins, prompt payment, and the ability to test new product innovations. Total e-commerce sales grew from approximately $6.3 million in 2020 to approximately $10.9 million in 2021.
 
Pursue growth in retail stores, private label opportunities and international distribution. Stryve has a strong relationship with leading retailers and distributors, including Costco, Wal-Mart, Aldi, UNFI, KeHe, 7-Eleven and others. Stryve is working to expand its retail customer base store penetration across the food, multi-outlet and convenience segments, as well as expanding the number of products available for sale at retail locations by adding additional product flavors. Stryve is also working to grow its private label business with retail customers, which can support Stryve’s efforts to place its branded products in those customers’ locations. In addition, Stryve may seek to develop relationships with international partners to expand its product sales outside the U.S. beyond its current limited distribution in Canada and Mexico.
 
Leverage manufacturing capacity and existing platform to expand and strengthen product offerings. Stryve believes that its manufacturing facility located in Madill, Oklahoma is the largest air-drying meat facility operating in the U.S., and one of only a limited number of such facilities approved by the USDA. The limited number of other USDA-approved facilities currently provides a barrier to entry for potential competitors to enter the air-dried meat snack category. Stryve plans to strengthen and expand its existing product offerings with new and innovative flavors and


formats, simple ingredients, and packaging alternatives, to complement its current products and take advantage of its manufacturing capabilities. In addition, Stryve will continue to enhance, strengthen and expand its existing product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms, simple ingredients and packaging alternatives.
    Continue to introduce healthy snackers to meat snacks. Stryve’s target consumers are healthy snack seekers, including consumers seeking to stay fit or diet, as well as runners, cyclists, and on-the-go families, many of whom are non-participants to the meat snack category. Stryve believes it can use social media as a cost-effective way to educate, attract and retain these consumers, utilizing targeted digital marketing, directed advertising and promotions, and informational videos. Through these efforts, Stryve is working to create a loyal group of healthy snack seeking consumers.
 
Stryve’s Brands and Products
    Stryve’s flagship product is air-dried beef, which is marketed and sold under the Stryve®, Kalahari®, Braaitime® and Vacadillos® brand names. Stryve currently produces two forms of air-dried meat: biltong and carne seca, which were developed hundreds of years ago in South Africa and Latin America, respectively. Stryve’s biltong generally consists of high-quality beef that is primarily sourced, purchased, seasoned, dried and packaged in the United States. Stryve’s air-dried process is intended to ensure that its beef retains full flavor and tenderness. Stryve’s products are not injected with any sugar-laden marinades or preservatives and are never cooked or dehydrated over high heat like beef jerky products. Substantially all of Stryve’s air-dried meat products are manufactured in the United States at its manufacturing facility in Madill, Oklahoma, with the exception of the use of a U.S. co-manufacturer who manufactured Kalahari products prior to Stryve’s acquisition of Kalahari in December 2020.
   Stryve also markets and sells meat sticks, chili bites, meat crisps, and nutrition products. Additionally, Stryve markets and sells carne seca products, which is Latin America’s version of air-dried meat, under the Vacadillos® brand name. Inspired by the cultural roots of the 62 million Hispanics living in the US today, Stryve expects its Vacadillos branded products to have mass appeal across consumer segments.

    Marketing, Advertising and Consumer Outreach
    Stryve’s marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness, driving product trials, and supporting repeat purchases using a disciplined approach to marketing spend. Stryve utilizes a combination of paid and earned media, intelligent e-mail and text campaigns, and shopper marketing programs to reach consumers.
Target Demographics
    Stryve’s target consumers are “healthy snack seekers,” many of whom eat meat, but are not current participants in the meat snacks industry. Stryve believes that through their differentiated and innovative air-dried meat products and marketing efforts it will be able to bring healthy snack seekers to Stryve’s products. Stryve has segmented healthy snack seekers group into five different sub-groups; fit and focused, disciplined and dieters, runners, cyclists, and the largest category, families in motion. Stryve believes that these groups have above average household income, read nutritional labels and are seeking healthy snacks for themselves and their families. Stryve believes there is significant opportunity to expand its marketing, education and product sales to healthy snack seekers who are not necessarily looking for a biltong meat snack, but are looking for health snacks that are high in protein with minimal sugar, protein


rich, low in carbohydrates, are free of monosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives, are Keto and Paelo diet-friendly and are all natural.
    Building Brand Awareness and Driving Product Trials
    Stryve seeks to expand its consumer base and grow its business by educating consumers about its product benefits and taste in order to encourage product trials and support repeat purchases resulting in customer loyalty and value. Stryve uses a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers, including paid digital media, paid influencers, organic social media efforts and, following the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, in-person product displays and sampling.
    Stryve dedicates a substantial portion of its marketing and advertising spending to digital marketing channels. Stryve’s website, www.stryve.com, and each of its brand’s websites, contain information about biltong and how it is made, and nutritional information regarding the benefits of Stryve’s products. Stryve utilizes a data-driven approach in its e-commerce strategy, with specific consumer segmentation and messaging tailored for different audiences.
    Stryve extensively uses social media and online platforms including Google, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. These platforms allow Stryve to directly reach desirable target audiences, offering product discounts and promotions, and educating consumers about the health benefits of its products. In addition, Stryve uses social media influencers and celebrities to amplify Stryve’s online marketing.
    Stryve also maintains a blog on its website in order to educate consumers about its products, product recipes and health benefits. Consumers can sign up for newsletter emails on its website for access to information about its products and recipes. Stryve also seeks to build repeat purchases by using targeted discounts and promotions as well as information on product innovation through intelligent email flows, text messages and subscribe and save offerings.
    Manufacturing
    Substantially all of Stryve’s products are manufactured in the United States at its manufacturing facility in Madill, Oklahoma. Stryve believes that manufacturing its products supports higher margins and speed to market, and facilitates its ability to take advantage of private label opportunities.
    Suppliers. Stryve relies on a limited number of vendors to supply it with beef and other raw materials. Stryve does not have any formal contracts or agreements in place with any meat providers, and generally secures meat two months in advance of production in order to meet delivery requirements for its products. Stryve purchases the majority of its beef through beef brokers from suppliers located in the United States. Given the minimally processed nature of biltong production, the quality of the beef used in Stryve’s products is important. Currently, Stryve believes it can replace its current suppliers of beef without significant impact to its business. The availability of grass-fed beef in the United States can be scarce at times, and may require Stryve to seek such beef internationally to produce its grass-fed products. However, any disruption in the supply of beef could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
    The other principal ingredients used to manufacture Stryve products include vinegar, flavoring and spices, packaging, and lamb casings. These ingredients are generally readily available in the market from many suppliers, Stryve believes that it can within a reasonable period of time make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply.
    Production Process.  Stryve believes that its manufacturing facility is the largest USDA approved air-dried meat manufacturing facility in the United States and that its extensive food safety procedures are proprietary. The manufacturing process for Stryve’s biltong products generally consists of spraying beef with vinegar, cutting it into slabs, mixing the slabs with spices, air-drying the meat, slicing and packaging finished products.
    Food Safety and Quality. Stryve dedicates substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe, high quality food products, including, but not limited to, third-party testing programs. Stryve’s manufacturing facility has a SQF Level II Food Safety Certification by the Safe Quality Food Institute. Stryve’s facility is inspected daily by the USDA and other regulators such as state and local inspectors and is required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. Stryve believes that the combination of USDA requirements for approving air-drying meat facilities and USDA restrictions


on importing air-dried or uncooked meats into the United States creates a barrier to entry for companies seeking to compete with Stryve’s products.
    Quality Control. Stryve developed quality protocols and procedures with its products and unique manufacturing processes in mind. Stryve performs testing on every lot of production intended to ensure that its products match Stryve’s standards, including by conducting sampling at various times throughout the production process.
    Storage & fulfillment. Stryve leases real property in Carrollton, Texas, where it stores some finished product and conducts its direct-to-consumer web fulfillment operations. Stryve leases approximately 8,400 square feet of floor space within the Carrollton, Texas property to serve as a distribution center. Stryve fulfills the majority of its orders other than direct-to-consumer sales from its manufacturing facility in Madill, Oklahoma, using commercial freight carriers. Stryve fulfills certain orders by key customers through a retail consolidator. Stryve also partners with Amazon to fulfill its direct-to-consumer sales through the Amazon platform.
    Distribution
    Stryve distributes its products through a number of channels:
    Retailers. Stryve distributes, either directly or through a distributor, its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club stores and other retail outlets. Sales to Stryve’s largest retailers, Aldi, Inc. and Walmart Inc. represented 11.5% and 10.5%, respectively of its sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. Sales to Aldi, Inc and Walmart Inc. represented 26.6% and 13.1%, respectively of its sales during the year ended December 31, 2020. Stryve has added new retailers throughout 2021, including Costco whose contribution to Stryve's revenue would have been material on an annualized basis.
    Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce. Stryve launched its stryve.com direct-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2020, and has sold its products on Amazon since 2018. Stryve has prioritized e-commerce as a key channel for growth. Stryve utilizes a data-driven approach to grow the e-commerce space with specific customer segmentation and messaging tailored for each audience. Stryve sells products directly to consumers through its websites, including Stryve.com, Eatbiltong.com, Vacadillos.com and Braaitime.com.
    Private Label. Stryve also manufactures and sells its products under private labels for certain retailers, including Aldi, Inc.
    International. Stryve currently distributes its products to a limited extent in Canada and Mexico through distribution partners. International sales represent an area for potential expansion.
    Product Innovation
    Stryve seeks to capitalize on the capacity of its manufacturing facility by expanding its product line to include additional dried meat snack products and flavors and form varieties, and expanding into additional meat snack products. Stryve’s innovation strategy is based on its ongoing research into consumers’ healthy lifestyle, nutritional needs and preferences.
Intellectual Property
    Stryve currently owns domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to its business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Stryve believes the protection of its trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to its success. Stryve protects its intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws. Stryve also owns all of the recipes and specifications to its products.
Competition
    Stryve competes in both retail and e-commerce channels with companies which make beef jerky and meat snacking products, as well companies in the healthy snacking industry which sell meal replacement bars and other healthy snacks.
    The snack industry is large and intensely competitive. In the meat snack market, Stryve’s competitors include Jack Links, Slim Jim, Tillamook, Country Archer, Chef’s Cut, Krave, Old Trapper, Chomps, Epic and others. In addition, the healthy snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive, and includes makers of protein bars, protein shakes and other specialty healthy snacks. Competitive factors include product quality, taste, brand awareness among consumers, nutritional content, simpler and less processed ingredients, innovation, variety of snacks offered, grocery aisle placement, access to retailer shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, product packaging and package design.
    Stryve’s current and potential competitors may offer products similar to its products, and a wider range of products than it offers, and may offer such products at more competitive prices than Stryve. Many of Stryve’s competitors have resources substantially greater than it has and sells brands that are more widely recognized than Stryve’s brands.
    Regulation and Compliance
    Stryve, along with its brokers, distributors, ingredients and packaging suppliers, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States promulgated by federal, state and local government authorities.
