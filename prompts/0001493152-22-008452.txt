Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a revenue stage medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of a suite of innovative diagnostic and treatment modalities for patients with dentofacial abnormalities and/or patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring in adults. We believe our proprietary oral appliances and associated protocols represent a significant improvement in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA versus other treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure (or CPAP) or palliative oral appliance therapies. We call our OSA treatment protocol The Vivos Method.
 
The Vivos Method is an advanced therapeutic protocol, which often combines the use of customized oral appliance specifications and proprietary clinical protocols developed by our company and prescribed by specially trained dentists in cooperation with their medical colleagues. The Vivos Method features our proprietary clinical protocols combined with the following oral appliances:



● | Mandibular Repositioning Nighttime Appliance (or mRNA appliance®) has 510(k) clearance from the FDA as a Class II medical device for the treatment of snoring and mild to moderate OSA in adults. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Modified Mandibular Repositioning Nighttime Appliance (or mmRNA appliance), for which we were granted FDA Class II market clearance in August 2021 for treating mild to moderate OSA, jaw reposition and snoring in adults. 
● | Daytime Nighttime Appliance (or DNA appliance®) is an FDA-registered product and is currently used by Vivos-trained clinicians accordingly. We instruct all dentists prescribing the DNA appliance about the device’s approved indications of use and of the fact that the DNA appliance is a Class I FDA registered oral appliance for expansion. 
● | Vivos Guides are pre-formed, flexible, BPA-free, base polymer intraoral guide and rescue appliances. The Guides are an FDA-registered product for orthodontic tooth positioning. 

 
We believe The Vivos Method appliance technology and associated protocols represents the first non-surgical, non-invasive and cost-effective treatment for people with dentofacial abnormalities and/or patients diagnosed with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring in adults. Combining technologies and protocols that alter the size, shape and position of the tissues of a patient’s upper airway, The Vivos Method opens oral and airway space and may significantly reduce symptoms and conditions associated with mild to moderate OSA.
 
Published studies have shown that using our customized appliances and clinical protocols led to significantly lower Apnea Hypopnea Index scores and improved other conditions associated with OSA, and The Vivos Method is estimated to be effective (within the scope of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) cleared uses) in approximately 80% of cases of OSA where patients are compliant with clinical protocols. Our patented oral appliances have been utilized in approximately 25,000 patients treated worldwide by more than 1,450 trained dentists.
 
The House of Delegates of the American Dental Association in 2017 adopted a policy statement describing the important role dentists can play in helping identify patients at greater risk of sleep related breathing disorders. By focusing our business model around dentists, we fulfil this role by training dentists and providing the support to use The Vivos Method with their patients that suffer from dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring. Our program to train dentists and offer them other value-added services is called the Vivos Integrated Practice (VIP) program. The VIP program provides dentists with a strong economic incentive to provide this treatment and prescribe The Vivos Method, together with practice support services.
 
Sleep apnea is a serious and chronic disease that negatively impacts a patient’s sleep, health, and quality of life. According to a 2019 article published in Chest Physician, it is estimated that OSA afflicts 54 million adults in the U.S. alone, and according to a 2016 report by Frost & Sullivan, OSA has an annual societal cost of over $149.6 billion. According to the study “Global Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)” conducted by an international panel of leading researchers, nearly 1 billion people worldwide have sleep apnea, and as many as 80% remain undiagnosed. Research has shown that when left untreated, OSA can increase the risk of comorbidities, such as high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, dementia, chronic pain and other debilitating, life-threatening diseases.

In February 2021, we launched our screening and home sleep test (“HST”) program (which we call our VivoScore Program) featuring SleepImage® technology, a 510(k) cleared ring-based recorder and diagnostic platform for home sleep apnea testing. We market and distribute our SleepImage HST in the U.S. and Canada pursuant to a licensing agreement with MyCardio LLC. We believe our SleepImage HST offers significant commercial advantages over existing home sleep apnea products and technologies in the market and may enable healthcare providers to more efficiently screen, diagnose and initiate treatment for OSA in their patients, which could result in more patients being treated through The Vivos Method. Initially, we anticipated increased revenue from our HST based on an expected increase in total patients tested for OSA and a corresponding increase in patient enrolment in Vivos Method treatment. Throughout 2021, we successfully conducted 15 training sessions conducted by our personnel on the VivoScore Program and screening and home sleep testing using the SleepImage® HST, which were attended by approximately 800 dentists and their staff.
 
In January 2022, we announced significant increases across several key metrics for our SleepImage HST, including in particular, for the three-months ended December 31, 2021, versus the three-months ended December 31, 2020: (i) an 18 times increase in the total number of HSTs given across our VIP network, (ii) a 5.7 times increase in the number of VIPs administering HSTs via the VivoScore Program and (iii) a 3 times increase in the average number of HSTs being administered per VIP. We believe this performance gain in home sleep testing allowed us to renegotiate our commercial agreement with MyCardio LLC to lower costs and convert the entire diagnostic program from a loss leader aimed primarily at stimulating new case starts with sleep apnea treatment using The Vivos Method to a potential recurring revenue center. Under the revised agreement, we will lease out the SleepImage ring recorders to VIPs at a fixed price that includes a full month’s worth of diagnostic sleep test reports. This potential new revenue center is as yet unproven, but we believe we will see positive results during 2022.
 
Our Mission
 
Our mission is to rid the world of OSA. We believe we are well-positioned with what we consider to be a disruptive technology in The Vivos Method aimed at treating dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring, with a clear first-mover strategy in penetrating the dental market as a means of treating dental conditions and OSA, compelling economics at each level of the delivery chain, and a talented team of experienced professionals who are passionate about what we do and driven to deliver results.
Our Market Opportunity
 
According to an August 2019 article published in the Lancet, an estimated 936 million adults globally aged 30-69 years (men and women) have mild to severe obstructive sleep apnea, which includes 425 million adults aged 30-69 years who have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The number of affected individuals with OSA was highest in China, followed by the U.S., Brazil, and India. The article indicated that 1 billion people (inclusive of children) are affected with OSA, with prevalence exceeding 50% in some countries. We therefore believe that effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are needed to minimize the negative health impacts of OSA and to maximize cost-effectiveness.
 
Estimates from publicly available information vary as to the extent of obstructive sleep apnea in the United States, but we believe the market is significant. According to a 2010 publicly available analysis from researchers at the Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine, mild obstructive sleep apnea is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (or AHI) of between 5 and 15 and has a prevalence of 8-11% of the adult population in the United States. A 2004 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association stated the prevalence of mild obstructive sleep apnea is one in five adults. Based on our analysis of the available public information, we estimate that approximately 15% of the adult population in the United States and Canada suffers from OSA. Based on the estimated total adult population of 284 million in the United States and Canada, we believe the total addressable United States and Canadian market is approximately 43 million adults. Our estimates set forth below relating to the intended uses of The Vivos Method are also based in part upon data found in the study Oral Appliance Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: An Update, published publicly by the National Institutes of Health in 2014. Targeted treatment projections identified by this method of sleep titration were found to result in effective treatment in 87% of patients predicted to be successfully treated of OSA in an initial study. To be conservative and based on available data and our internal market analysis, we estimate that over 80% of individuals diagnosed with OSA in the North American addressable market may be candidates for The Vivos Method, leaving us with a total addressable consumer market of over 43.2 million adults.
 
We currently charge clinicians an average sales price of approximately $1,600 per adult case for The Vivos Method. There are approximately 200,000 general dentists and dental specialists in the United States and another 30,000 in Canada who could potentially offer the Vivos Method to their patients. Based on the addressable U.S. and Canadian consumer market described above and average sales price, we believe the addressable consumer market for adults in the United States and Canada is approximately $69 billion.
 
According to a March 2021 Sleep Apnea Devices Market Size & Share Report, “Sleep Apnea Devices Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Product Type (Diagnostic Devices, Therapeutic Devices, Sleep Apnea Masks), By Region (North America, Europe, APAC, Latin America, MEA), And Segment Forecasts, 2021 – 2028”, the global sleep apnea devices market size was valued at $3.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028. According to an American Sleep Association study published in 2020, an estimated 50 million to 70 million people in the U.S. are suffering from some form of sleep disorders. Moreover, according to Canadian Respiratory Journal in 2014, around 5.4 million adults in Canada were diagnosed with sleep apnea or were at higher risk of developing OSA. According to a study conducted by ResMed in 2018, around 175 million people in Europe were suffering from sleep apnea.”

Our Treatment Alternative for OSA – The Vivos Method
 
The Vivos Method is a non-invasive, non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical, multi-disciplinary treatment modality for the treatment of dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring. Proprietary and virtually painless, The Vivos Method may enhance and increase the upper airway and offers patients what we believe to be an effective treatment alternative based on clinical retrospective data showing that some patients diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA and snoring symptoms. are improving. Based on feedback from independent VIP and their patient we have received, we believe initial therapeutic benefits from using the protocols and devices are often achieved relatively quickly (in days or weeks) and final clinical results are typically achieved in 12 to 24 months), all at a relatively low cost to consumers ranging between $7,000 and $10,000 for adults and $3,500 to $6,000 for children (costs vary by provider) when compared to other options such as surgery.
 
We believe that The Vivos Method alters the size, shape and position of the tissues that surround and comprise the functional space known as the upper airway. This belief is based on retrospective raw data with validated before and after sleep studies and Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) scans from treating clinicians and patient testimony. As The Vivos Method treatment process progresses, the airway expands, with many patients reporting a significant reduction of their mild to moderate OSA and snoring symptoms. Our primary products used in The Vivos Method is our mRNA appliance®, and our mmRNA appliance® which are specifically designed, custom oral appliance that are worn primarily in the evening hours and overnight and are available for adults. The treatment time may range from 12 to 24 months. Our appliances may require periodic adjustments some of which can be performed by the patient and others that are typically rendered at the dental office where treatment was initiated. Through the course of treatment with The Vivos Method, patients have reported a variety of outcomes, including:
 

● | Reduction of snoring; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduction in AHI level and/or other indicators of mild to moderate OSA; 
● | Relief of mild to moderate OSA symptoms; 
● | Restoration and improvement of normal (nasal) breathing; 
● | Improvement in overall sleep quality; 
● | Reduction in the need for other lifetime treatment options such as CPAP; 
● | Restoration and maintenance of proper facial symmetry and alignment; 
● | Dentofacial and orthodontic improvement and/or correction; 
● | Resolution of TMJ pain, clicking, and locking; and 
● | Facial aesthetic improvement, including a broader smile and reduced ‘gummy smile’. 

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to be the global leader in providing a clinically effective non-surgical, non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical, and low-cost alternative for patients with dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring in adults. We believe the following strategies will play a critical role in achieve this goal and our future growth:

● | Expand our North American (U.S. and Canada) sales and marketing organization to drive adoption of The Vivos Method. We intend to continue the growth our sales and marketing organization and related strategic programs in order to target and expand our network of Vivos Integrated Practices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Drive medical and dental community awareness of The Vivos Method. We intend to continue to promote awareness of the value proposition of The Vivos Method through training and educating dentists, physicians, and other healthcare providers, including at our Vivos Institute in Denver, Colorado.

---


● | Continue to establish indirect marketing channels. We have entered, and plan to expand, strategic alliances within the medical and dental communities to increase awareness of our products. For example, in August 2021, we announced a new cooperative relationship with Empower Sleep, a San Bernardino, California-based company empowering patients with affordable, accessible and personalized telemedicine sleep care, to provide critical diagnostic and medical consultation services to people across North America who suffer from OSA. We plan to leverage Empower Sleep’s core technologies to provide a user-friendly platform with personalized insights for our products for patients who are being screened for OSA by North American dentists and other healthcare providers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Build consumer awareness of The Vivos Method. We also plan to continue building consumer awareness through our direct-to-patient marketing initiatives which we anticipate will include celebrity endorsements, paid search, radio, television, social media, influencers, company sponsored events, corporate wellness programs, and online video. 
● | Invest in research and development to drive innovation and expand indications. We are committed to ongoing research and development, and we intend to invest in our business to further improve our products and validate our value proposition. 
● | Pursue strategically adjacent markets and international opportunities. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our products outside the United States. We have begun an initial assessment of the development and commercialization of The Vivos Method for markets outside of North America, and we plan to conduct further strategic evaluation of such markets as we expand our market penetration throughout the United States and Canada. 

Our Revenue Model
 
Our revenue is currently derived from the following primary sources:
 

● | VIP office training and enrollment fees. These fees are comprised of one-time, up-front fees, as well as optional renewal fees after 12 months. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recurring Vivos appliance sales. Once we train the VIP on how dentists can help treat OSA, the goal is to have them initiate “new case starts” with patients, which leads to sales of our appliances and guides. 
● | Recurring VIP subscription fees. These are recurring fees that a portion of our VIPs pay us to receive additional value-added services and training. 
● | SleepImage HST revenue. As described above, we recently modified our agreement with MyCardio LLC relating to our SleepImage HST for sleep apnea, which creates the potential for revenue from our leasing of SleepImage HST ring recorders to our VIPs as part of the VivoScore Program. 
● | The Vivos Institute. Opened in August 2021, our 15,000 square foot Vivos Institute provides advanced post-graduate education and certification to dentists, dental teams, and other healthcare professionals in a live and hands-on setting in the emerging science of what we call Vivos Care (Complete Airway Repositioning and Expansion) and product-specific training for the use of our products and services. Revenue from such courses is not material at the present time, but our expectation is that increased training awareness of OSA and the promotion of our products and services will be enhanced by the Vivos Institute. 
● | The Airway Intelligence Service (AIS). This service provides a complete resource for VIPs to help simplify the diagnostic and appliance design matrix and expedite the treatment planning process. AIS is provided as part of the price of each appliance and is not a separate revenue stream. 
● | Billing Intelligence Services (BIS). This complete third-party billing solution includes a comprehensive integrated revenue cycle management software system that allows dentists to focus on running their practice and delivering the best care for their patients. This medical billing service generates recurring subscription fees from participating VIPs and independent dentists in the United States.

● | AireO2 Patient Management Software. This management software enables healthcare professionals to diagnose, treat and monitor patients with OSA and its related conditions more effectively. Developed in collaboration with Lyon Dental, AireO2 contains features that enhance a VIP’s billing services and practice management systems. AireO2 is a complement to our BIS software system. In April 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lyon Management and Consulting, LLC and its affiliates to acquire certain medical billing and practice management software, licenses and contracts, including the software underlying AireO2. The asset acquisition allows us to expand and enhance our current medical billing practice through our BIS division. The terms of the purchase include $0.2 million of cash and the issuance of a warrant to purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $8.90 per share for three years. The vesting of the warrant is as follows: 5,000 shares vested immediately upon issuance of the warrant, 10,000 shares vest and become exercisable on April 14, 2022 and 10,000 shares vest and become exercisable on April 14, 2023. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medical Integration Division (MID). In late 2020, we launched our MID to assist VIP practices to establish clinical collaboration ties to local primary care physicians, sleep specialists, ear, nose a throat doctors (ENTs), cardiologists, pediatricians, pulmonologists and other healthcare providers who routinely see or treat patients with sleep and breathing disorders. The primary objective of our MID is to promote The Vivos Method to medical providers and thus facilitate the potential for more mild to moderate OSA patients gaining access to The Vivos Method while offering continuum of care. The MID seeks to fulfill that objective by meeting with VIP dentists and medical providers in their local areas to establish physician practices using the trademarked name “Pneusomnia Sleep Reimagined Center” (which we refer to as Pneusomnia Centers that are part of the Vivos MID). These independent medical practices will be managed by our company under a management and development agreement which pays us six (6%) percent of all net revenue from sleep-related services. We also collect a development fee for each clinic prior to opening establishing all operational protocols. We have built into our core MID business model a great degree of flexibility, such that elements of each Pneusomnia Center as described above may change and be adapted to local state laws and regulations, and entity formation laws as any such alterations do not violate any state or federal statutes or regulations. We believe our early market response from MID activities has been promising, and in March 2021 we announced the opening of the first Pneusomnia Center in Del Mar, California, and in May 2021, the second in Modesto, California, with plans to open additional Pneusomnia Centers in several other cities in the U.S. However, it remains too early to predict the eventual impact on our overall revenue. If successful, the MID is expected to enhance the overall practice level economics for independent VIP offices and generate additional lines of recurring revenue for us. 
● | MyoCorrect (Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy) Program. In March 2021, we introduced orofacial myofunctional therapy (or OMT) as a service that is part of The Vivos Method, under the name MyoCorrect. Through MyoCorrect, dentists enrolled in the VIP program will have access to trained therapists who provide OMT via telemedicine technology. This OMT therapy can be a component of obstructive sleep apnea treatment in conjunction with The Vivos Method which includes our Class II oral appliances and protocols. OMT, which is given by a certified OMT therapist, involves exercises and other techniques aimed at strengthening the tongue and orofacial muscles by teaching individuals how to engage the muscles to the appropriate position. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that The Vivos Method has numerous advantages that, taken together, set us apart from the competition and position us for success in the marketplace:

● | Significant barriers to entry: We believe that third parties seeking to compete directly with us have significant barriers to entry for the following reasons: competitors must offer a treatment modality with similar features, capabilities, research support, FDA regulatory clearances, and successful clinical outcomes in the market; then establish a comprehensive educational training program featuring other clinical professionals with actual experience and success using that particular treatment modality to properly educate dentists on all clinical aspects of use with patients; then develop and promulgate the systems and best practices required to successfully integrate the treatment of dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring using this novel treatment modality in a dental practice; then establish and provide, by recruitment and otherwise, ongoing clinical mentoring and support to independent dentists engaged in treating their patients for dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring and related conditions (clinical mentors are limited and may be hard to find); and finally, assisting the dentists with case selection, case acceptance, patient financing, and medical insurance reimbursement. We believe we have strategically and effectively addressed each and every one of the aforementioned barriers to entry, and thus have created a novel and compelling single-source value proposition for dentists seeking to deliver OSA treatment to their patients.

● | Vivos Method insurance reimbursement: Most major commercial insurance (and also Medicare for the mmRNA appliance, which we achieved during 2021), reimburse for our adult treatment in the United States. The average level of commercial payer reimbursement is approximately 50% (with coverage ranging from 5% to 70%), although medical insurance is never a guarantee of payment, and patient deductibles and policy restrictions will vary. Medicare reimbursement for the mmRNA appliance will vary by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) jurisdiction in the U.S. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Body of published research and strong patient outcomes: Together with our network of trained dentists, we have developed a body of clinical and patient data over approximately ten years and an estimated 25,000 patients treated with our proprietary clinical protocols that demonstrates the safety, effectiveness, therapy adherence (patient compliance), and benefits of The Vivos Method for its registered and 510(k) cleared uses. The documented and reported benefits of treatment with The Vivos Method have been consistent across reports from independent dentists and have been highlighted in approximately 55 published studies, case reports, and articles, many of which have been peer reviewed. We believe this favorable data provides us with a significant competitive advantage and will continue to support increased adoption. 
● | First mover advantage: Our business model is the first to focus on dentists screening patients for mild to moderate OSA, referring patients to physicians for diagnosis, with the dentists then serving as the primary source of treatment using The Vivos Method for such patients. 
● | Differentiated products: To our knowledge, we believe only The Vivos Method offers a truly differentiated, non-invasive treatment option that actually works on a common root cause of OSA. We also believe that older oral appliances are typically less expensive, but do not reshape the upper airway like our appliances, and therefore require nightly use over a lifetime, and have a number of other disadvantages. 
● | Intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities We have a comprehensive patent portfolio to protect our intellectual property and technology, five design patents that expire between 2023 through 2029 and two utility patents expiring in 2029 and 2030. We own two Canadian patents and one European patent that has been validated in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Hungary, Italy and the Netherlands, all of which expire in 2029. We also have three pending utility patents. Our U.S. trademark portfolio consists of 10 registered marks and one pending trademark applications. Extensive online and in-person training, multiple touch point support systems, specific fabrication materials, customized appliance designs, and multi-disciplinary treatment protocols are all considered proprietary trade secrets and competitive advantages with no known counterparts. 


● | Extensive Training and Support Systems: We believe our extensive online and in-person clinical and business systems training program offered through The Vivos Institute is unmatched anywhere in dentistry and is a clear competitive strength that would be difficult to replicate. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Targeted approach to market development: We have established a systematic and scalable approach to actively and consistently engage with our primary target audience of U.S. and Canadian dentists. In addition, our MID is actively targeting physicians and other relevant healthcare providers in order to build awareness and collaborative patient options for independent VIP practices. 
● | Marketplace acceptance: Patient access to The Vivos Method at a VIP practice is becoming more readily available, and active VIP providers can now be found in almost all major U.S. cities and in many cities in Canada.

Sales and Marketing
 
We have established a methodical approach to market development which centers on active engagement directly with members of the medical community, including general dentists and medical doctors who treat dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring, to educate them on The Vivos Method and its benefits. The goals of our sales and marketing efforts are (i) to secure new VIP dentists and provide them with the tools to treat patients with our products and (ii) more broadly educate the medical community regarding our products with a view towards expanding our number of VIPs as well as medical professionals who could refer patients to our VIPs for treatment.
 
We sell the VIP Program to dentists through a direct sales force that primarily targets general dentists in the United States and Canada. Our sales effort is developed through social media initiatives, and our new website with over 150 videos, and the production of over 350 new content creation projects. Our VIP program was developed to train independent dentists to identify and treat dental conditions that may be associated with mild to moderate sleep apnea. Our sales program to target medical doctors is our MID program, which was developed to assist VIP practices to establish clinical collaboration ties to local primary care physicians, sleep specialists, ENTs, pediatricians, pulmonologists and other healthcare professionals who routinely see or treat patients with sleep and breathing disorders.
 
In countries outside of North America we typically offer a modified training and support program at a lower cost. We currently have approximately 25 direct sales representatives in the United States and Canada. Our direct sales force engages in sales efforts and promotional activities focused on referring physicians, as well as directly to the over 200,000 professionally active general dentists in the United States and 20,000 general dentists in Canada.
 
Our current VIP sales organization is comprised of three teams consisting of:
 

● | one Enrollment Specialist, who is the primary salesperson responsible for enrolling new VIPs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | two Enrollment Support Staff members, who are responsible for organizing potential VIP appointments for the Enrollment Specialist; 
● | three Business Development Associates, who are responsible for cultivating new business leads which are referred to the Enrollment Support Staff; 
● | one Outreach and Engagement Associate, who is responsible for engaging with potential VIPs in our sales process with surveys and offers of online courses with the purpose of leads to be referred to the Enrollment Support Staff members; and 
● | one Practice Advisory Onboarding Specialist, who is responsible for onboarding new VIPs to our training programs. 

 
Our MID sales organization is comprised of a Senior Vice President that leads the MID sales efforts and one Senior Director of Business Development. We plan on growing our MID sales organization by recruiting candidates that have extensive healthcare backgrounds, strong business development experience setting up physician owned medical facilities/practices and significant healthcare regulatory knowledge.

We utilize indirect and direct marketing channels to inform and educate dentists, medical doctors and healthcare professionals about The Vivos Method. Our indirect marketing channels include strategic partners, industry key opinion leaders, trade shows and our own clinical advisor network. In 2021, we made strides by establishing the following strategic partnerships aimed and broadening awareness of and selling efforts for The Vivos Method:
 

● | In October 2021, we announced a new collaboration with Candid Care Co., a digital platform for oral healthcare, which that will seek to provide patients with a comprehensive, whole-mouth solution to diagnose and treat OSA in adult patients and provide orthodontic treatment from the same provider network. At the core of this collaboration, Vivos and Candid will market each company’s products and areas of expertise to deliver a comprehensive sleep and oral health solution to patients in the United States and Canada. The focus of the collaboration will be Candid’s CandidPro clear aligner for straightening teeth and the Vivos Method for treating OSA. The two companies will also share educational resources, training, and key opinion leaders to bridge the gap between airway health and orthodontic therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our ongoing collaboration with Candid is still in the early and formative stages, primarily due to a major strategy change by Candid where they completely shut down their direct-to-consumer initiatives in order to focus entirely on their CandidPro model emphasizing active dentist participation and patient interaction. Now that Candid has made that transition, we fully expect to see an increase in alignment and close collaboration between our two companies. The emphasis will be on sharing provider lists, dentist prospects, DSO affiliations, and jointly developing future clinical products. We currently have bi-weekly conference calls between respective company senior management and expect that to continue. 
● | In August 2021, we announced a cooperative relationship with Empower Sleep, a San Bernardino, California-based company empowering patients with affordable, accessible and personalized telemedicine sleep care, to provide critical diagnostic and medical consultation services to people across North America who suffer from OSA. Together, Vivos and Empower Sleep plan to leverage each company’s core technologies to provide a user-friendly platform with personalized insights for patients who are being screened for OSA by North American dentists and other healthcare providers. 
 | Empower Sleep spent most of 2021 organizing and obtaining medical licensure throughout the U.S. Currently, Empower Sleep is fully licensed to practice medicine in approximately 40 states and expect to be in all 50 states by the end of the second quarter of 2022. Dr. Sahil Chopra is the primary sleep specialist and owner of Empower Sleep. He regularly speaks at Vivos events and has largely organized his company in a manner that best serves our VIPs and their patients. While much progress has been made to fully operationalize the Vivos/Empower Sleep dentist and patient interactions, we believe some work remains to smooth out the inefficiencies and normal start-up risks. We believe our two companies work very well together and share a mutual purpose and mission. 

 
Our direct marketing channels include outreach to prospective VIPs using digital advertising platforms including Facebook and Google ad placements. The objective of our indirect and direct marketing efforts are to bring dentists, medical doctors and healthcare professionals to our educational and training websites to learn about OSA and its treatment alternatives.
 
We further believe our dentist and medical doctor marketing efforts have been effective in facilitating contact via our Vivos introduction and online training webinars, despite significant headwinds throughout our core customer base, mostly driven by COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variant resurgences in the middle and latter part of the year.
 
Potential Economics for Trained VIP Clinicians
 
Dentists that enroll in our VIP program have the potential for compelling economics. The actual incidence of dental patients with OSA will vary, but our conservative estimate would suggest that the average dental practice sees 400-500 adult patients a year with a high risk of suffering from obstructive sleep apnea. Using these demographic figures, the economic potential per dentist may be calculated, based on a retail adult case fee of approximately $9,000, fully burdened VIP provider costs of approximately $3,000, and net profit of approximately $6,000, to be over $3.3 million in annual gross revenue potential annually with over $2.4 million in potential net profit. We believe, based on our experience, that dentists have seen accretive economic additions to their practices by utilizing The Vivos Method, and thus participation in the VIP program can likely add to the dentist’s take-home income.
 
In terms of continuing training, our sales and clinical advisory dentists conduct training primarily in a highly personalized, deep immersion workshop format at our Vivos Institute. The key topics covered in training include case selection, clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, appliance design, adjunctive therapies, information on our productions and services, guidance on pricing, case acceptance, instruction on insurance reimbursement protocols and interacting with our proprietary software system and the many other features of our website. We present our training material in a manner we believe to be superior to most other dental training and experience, including preparatory online courses, didactic lectures, hands-on training, specialized small group breakout sessions, and post training technical support from assigned mentors. As a result, we are able to complete the initial training workshops, both online and in person, typically within just 15 days spread out over several weeks. Our success in training approximately 1,450 dentists confirms our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dentists.

Below is an illustrative model depicting the total additional revenue a dentist might receive by treating patients with The Vivos Method. The potential patients with dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA is determined by using a calculation that results in a conservative estimate that 30% of patients of a dental practice patient may suffer from OSA (according to a 2019 article published in Chest Physician). The revenue treatment fee is estimated at $9,000 per patient. This illustration helps to explain why a dentist might want to become a trained VIP and use The Vivos Method.
 

Number of Active Patients in Typical Dental Practice | | Potential Patients with OSA | | Potential Additional Revenue for Dentist 
-------------------------------------------------------+-------+-------------------------------+-----+--------------------------------------------
 | 1,250 | | 375 | | $ | 3,375,000
 | 1,500 | | 450 | | | 4,050,000
 | 1,750 | | 525 | | | 4,725,000
 | 2,000 | | 600 | | | 5,400,000
 | 2,250 | | 675 | | | 6,075,000

 
To facilitate the adoption of The Vivos Method, we market the VIP Program, and as part of that offering, we often partner with equipment manufacturers to bundle training and equipment into a turn-key program financed by third party lenders for those dental practices who need to purchase additional equipment. The VIP Program fees are also often financed by third party lenders separate from any equipment purchases. Loan terms and payments will vary depending on the doctor’s credit, the interest rate, the amount financed, and the term of the loan. Generally, payments on such financing range from about $600 to $2,500 per month.
 
Insurance Reimbursement
 
Our mRNA appliance® and mmRNA appliance® are custom fabricated appliances to treat mild to moderate OSA and snoring in adults. The mRNA and mmRNA can be billed in and out of network to most commercial payers under the E0486 CPT code. The E0486 is reimbursable by many major commercial medical payers following a medical diagnosis of OSA. Level of reimbursement is approximately 50% (ranging from 5% to 70%), although medical insurance is never a guarantee of payment, and patient deductibles and policy limitations may vary. A verification of benefits is required for all medical policies to check for validity of CPT code E0486 and oral appliance therapy (OAT). Pre-authorization may be required for reimbursement. Pre-Authorization requirements may vary based on the payer policies and patient’s insurance coverage. Although many patients pay for treatment out of pocket on a fee for service basis, the availability of health insurance coverage is an important consideration for many patients who desire treatment in The Vivos Method. All medical policies have different reimbursement policies which may affect availability of reimbursement.
 
VIPs typically remain out of network with commercial health insurance payers, but this depends on the individual practice and the commercial payer guidelines in each state. As out of network providers, dentists can set their own fees and balance bill the patient for the cost of care not covered by the patient’s health insurance. The American Medical Association will provide fee ranges for all billable CPT codes. A dentist must set their own fees for the CPT codes billed in their office that are within their scope of practice.
 
Our mRNA appliance® and our DNA appliance are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid as they do not meet the approved design criteria by CMS. We made modifications to the mRNA appliance®  to meet CMS criteria for the billing code E0486 to Medicare. These slight modifications of the mRNA appliance® led to the creation of a new FDA cleared device, the mmRNA appliance® (Modified Mandibular Repositioning Nighttime Appliance). In February 2021, we submitted a 510(k) for Class II clearance to the FDA for the mmRNA appliance with indications to treat mild to moderate OSA and snoring in adults, which was approved by FDA in August 2021. In December 2021, we received acceptance from a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding (“PDAC”) contractor for our mmRNA applicable for treating mild to moderate OSA and snoring in adults. This acceptance places the mmRNA device on the PDAC list of oral appliances covered by and billable to Medicare, making the benefits of the mmRNA device available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. Notwithstanding this important achievement, in general we have not found the lack of inclusion on the current CMS Medicare list of approved sleep appliances to hinder market distribution or acceptance due to the fact that most dentists who work with The Vivos Method are out of network with commercial payers and do not typically file for reimbursement under Medicare.

We have seen an increase in the ability for reimbursement for our other FDA registered oral appliances such as the DNA appliance and the Vivos Guides. These oral appliances are being pre-authorized and billed under an undefined CPT code only when medical necessity is present and documented properly. Pre-authorization with medical director review is required with a “letter of medical necessity” (LMN) to gain possible medical reimbursement. A dentist billing an undefined CPT code for a Class I or Class II oral appliance must proceed with caution. Billing an undefined CPT code for OAT must be supported with documented medical necessity and is reviewed by the medical director at the payor before being submitted for possible reimbursement. Typically, the dentist writes an LMN to explain the medical necessity and the patient’s request for oral appliance therapy and submits the LMN for review to the medical directors at the payor. The plan medical directors will then review the LMN, including any dentofacial abnormalities, CT images, comorbidities, and any medical conditions the patient has be diagnosed with by a medical doctor. This documentation is how the dentist establishes medical necessity. Once pre-authorization is gained, then OAT can be billed for a possible reimbursement from the medical payor. A dentist typically can gain reimbursement for OAT by the medical insurance if the undefined code is valid and billable under their policy and there is medical necessity present, supported, and documented.
 
Published Research
 
There are several studies in the medical literature on upper airway remodeling in pathologic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar conditions. In contrast, there is a dearth of studies that have documented pneumatization and physiologic upper airway remodeling. Advances in 3D digital technology, as well as an increased understanding of the human genome and epigenetics, has allowed us to make further advances in the understanding of dentofacial phenomena. For example, while it was believed that sutures undergo closure in early adulthood, according to published research, it is now thought that populations of stem cells may persist to permit continued growth and development. Using this premise, the midfacial bone volume can be increased surgically or non-surgically. Since the roof of the mouth is the floor of the nose, the volume of the nasal airway can also be increased surgically or non-surgically. Therefore, using our patented, non-surgical protocols we targeted oral conditions and upper airways to address dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring. Using various assessment techniques, we found surface area, volumetric and functional changes of the upper airway.
 
Since 2009, our technology has been the subject of approximately 55 peer-reviewed articles in the medical, dental and orthodontic literature. Of the 55 articles, 27 of these are journal papers, with Dr. G. Dave Singh, our founder and former Chief Medical Officer, as first author on 22 of these papers. Of the 27 journal papers, 17 of these articles describe the studies that examine the impact of our technology and protocols on the AHI scores of patients with varying degrees of OSA as described in “Overview” above. In addition, over 25 conference papers have been published as abstracts, with Dr. Singh as first author on 20 of these conference papers. Additionally, there were 19 independent dentists and five different sleep physicians are co-authors on these publications as well. The results published in these case reports and articles, together with patient-reported outcomes, have illustrated that The Vivos Method therapy can provide a significant change in the severity of patients’ with dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring (as measured by industry standard indices such as the AHI, among others), improvement in oral conditions, sleep-related quality of life, reduction in snoring, high patient compliance rates and a strong safety profile.


Intellectual Property
 
To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. Our intellectual property is important in achieving and maintaining our position in the market. We currently own five design patents that expire between 2023 through 2029 and two utility patents expiring in 2029 and 2030. We also own two Canadian patents and a European patent that has been validated in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Hungary, Italy and the Netherlands, all of which expire in 2029. Our U.S. trademark portfolio consists of ten registered marks and one pending trademark application. Extensive online and in-person training, multiple touch point support systems, specific fabrication materials, customized appliance designs, and multi-disciplinary treatment protocols are all considered proprietary trade secrets and competitive advantages with no known counterparts.

FDA Regulatory Status
 
The Vivos Method offers treatment protocol that uses nonsurgical, noninvasive, and cost-effective oral appliance technology prescribed by trained dentists and medical professionals to treat dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to moderate OSA and snoring. The Vivos Method includes a customized treatment plan that may begin with a simple and easy at-home sleep apnea screening using proprietary HST technology from SleepImage. We offer two Class II devices cleared by the FDA (mRNA and mmRNA) and one Class I device registered with the FDA (DNA). We offer our own pre-formed Vivos Guides. The regulatory status of our products is as follows:

● | Our mmRNA (Pat.Pend.) appliance has a 510(k) clearance from the FDA as a Class II medical device for the treatment of jaw repositioning, snoring and mild to moderate OSA in adults. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our mRNA appliance® has 510(k) clearance from the FDA as a Class II medical device for the treatment of snoring and mild to moderate OSA in adults. 
● | The DNA appliance® is an FDA-registered product for expansion and is currently used by Vivos-trained clinicians. We instruct all dentists prescribing the DNA appliance about the device’s approved indications of use and of the fact that the DNA appliance is a Class I FDA registered oral appliance. Dentists, as licensed clinicians within the scope of their practice, are free to diagnose, treat and prescribe the appropriate oral appliance therapy as they see fit, including uses which might be “off label”, based on their professional judgement. Given the fact that our dentists regularly prescribe the DNA appliance to treat conditions closely associated with OSA, we do not believe a failure to receive FDA Class II clearance would materially impact our results or financial condition. Any potential consequences of off-label use of the DNA appliance are the responsibility of the treating dentist; however, we may face consequences related to such off-label use. See “Risk Factors— The misuse or off-label use of The Vivos Method may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.” 
● | The Vivos Guides are an FDA-registered product for orthodontic tooth positioning. In October 2021, we announced that results from a peer-reviewed, published study by an independent dentist found a significant reduction of tooth decay in pediatric patients after undergoing treatment using our Vivos Guides. 

 
We are conducting two separate Western Copernicus Group Institutional Review Board (WCG IRB) approved pediatric clinical trials with eight private dental sites around the country. The purpose of the first study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intraoral device (the DNA) to reduce sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children, including: snoring, mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS). The child subjects enrolled in this study will be using the DNA appliance to correct orthodontic issues. They will also present with midfacial hypoplasia suitable for palatal expansion. During orthodontic treatment and palatal expansion, the device will be studied to determine whether it can also reduce symptoms of sleep disordered breathing in children. The study will recruit pediatric subjects who have already elected to utilize the study device for their orthodontic treatment. If they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, then they will be included in the study. The purpose of the second study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intraoral device (the Vivos Grow and/or Vivos Way appliances) to reduce sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children, including: snoring, mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS). The child subjects enrolled in this study will be using the Vivos Grow/Vivos Way appliance to correct orthodontic issues. They will also present with midfacial hypoplasia suitable for palatal expansion. During orthodontic treatment and palatal expansion, the devices will be studied to determine whether they can also reduce symptoms of sleep disordered breathing in children. The study will recruit pediatric subjects who have already elected to utilize the study device for their orthodontic treatment. If they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria they can be included in the study. Upon completion of these WIRB pediatric clinical trials (expected to be completed in the next 6 to 12 months), we plan to submit two separate 510(k) applications to the FDA requesting pediatric clearances and indications of use for the DNA appliance® as well as the Vivos Guides.
 
Our mRNA appliance® and mmRNA appliance® are cleared by the FDA as Class II sleep appliances to treat mild to moderate OSA and snoring in adults. Patients undergoing treatment are seeing improvement in the said cleared indications of use, but clinicians have also reported that they are seeing other comorbidities and medical conditions improve due to treatment. These appliances (which are central to The Vivos Method) and other Vivos appliances are made available to trained clinicians who exercise their independent clinical judgment with respect to their use and suitability as a part of an overall treatment protocol created for each individual patient.

In September 2017 our subsidiary, BMS, was the subject of its first routine FDA audit. That audit resulted in findings that required BMS to remediate certain deficiencies such as: (i) inadequate documentation of certain FDA-required procedures (i) not keeping certain records and materials in paper format and in triplicate, and (iii) the use of certain descriptive words and phrases on its website and in marketing materials that were not approved in advance by FDA. We immediately hired a highly qualified FDA consultant and legal counsel with FDA expertise to assist BMS in preparing both a written response and a plan for regaining and maintaining compliance with FDA regulations and guidelines. In good faith, and based on documents provided by BMS, we believed BMS had filed its response to the original audit in a timely manner with FDA which was due on [ ]. However, in January 2018 BMS received a request for a response to an FDA Warning Letter (the “Warning Letter”) that had been posted online at the FDA website. The Warning Letter stated that BMS failed to reply in a timely manner and address the findings of the September audit. We believed that we had filed out response to the FDA on September 27, 2017. The local BMS office in Portland, Oregon was closed down as of September 30, 2017 pursuant to a share exchange agreement which made BMS a subsidiary of our company (and which transaction was accounted for as a merger as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements). This transaction was disclosed to the FDA, and neither we nor BMS ever received any further notices from FDA after September 2017.
 
Immediately upon becoming aware of the miscommunication and deficiency, we notified the FDA of the error and provided the FDA with full documentation of our substantial efforts to fully comply with FDA rules and regulations. The FDA completed a second audit in April 2018, which examined our responses to the initial deficiencies and our compliance plan. We believe that this matter has been satisfactorily resolved, although no definitive statement to that effect has been made by FDA, nor has the Warning Letter been taken down from the FDA website. The FDA also audited our company (then known as Vivos BioTechnologies, Inc.) and issued one minor observation, to which we have responded and addressed.
 
In August of 2020, we underwent our 2-year FDA regulatory inspection. This inspection resulted in our receipt of an FDA Form 483 with two observations. These observations were corrected and responded to according the Code of Federal Regulations. Upon the review of the 483 responses, the FDA delivered a letter to us requesting additional information. We responded to the letter, and thereafter learned that the FDA was satisfied with our responses.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers on a per order, or per item basis. Outsourcing manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expenses. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our appliances. We select our manufacturing labs so we can ensure that our appliances are safe and effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. We also rely on third-party carriers and freight forwarders for product shipments, including shipments to and from our manufactures’ distribution facilities and customer distribution facilities.

Our Ongoing Clinical Research
 
We are committed to ongoing research and development, and we intend to invest in our business to further improve our products and clinical outcomes, increase patient acceptance and comfort and broaden the patient population that can benefit from The Vivos Method.

● | Protocol approved February 2021 – Biomimetic oral appliance therapy (BOAT) for the treatment of mild to moderate OSA in adults (March 2022 renamed “Daytime Nighttime Appliance (DNA) therapy for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)”). The aim of this study is to investigate structural and functional effects of the treatment protocol using the DNA appliance® in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA in adults. This study will test the hypothesis that treatment of the upper airway associated with functional improvements of sleep parameters in adults with mild to moderate OSA.

● | Commenced January 2019 – Treatment of SDB with an intraoral device in a pediatric population. Approved by WCG IRB as non-significant controlled clinical trials, we are conducting 2 separate clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DNA appliance® and the Vivos Guides (which we call the Vivos Grow and Vivos Way appliances) to reduce SDB in children, including snoring, mild to moderate OSA, and UARS. The WCG IRB is an independent Institutional Review Board located in Olympia, Washington that provides services for academic and non-academic institutions. WCG IRB is accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs. (AAHRPP) Clinical outcomes: Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire, reduction in sleep apnea and UARS using the AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents, and changes in upper airway volume. 

Government Regulation
 
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
 
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
 
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or pre-market approval (PMA). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed (for which the FDA has not required a PMA submission) prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available device that was cleared to through the 510(k) process. The FDA has 90 days from the date of the pre-market equivalence acceptance to authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device. However, similar to the PMA process, clearance may take longer than this three-month window, as the FDA can request additional data. If the FDA resolves that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, then the device acquires a Class III designation, and a PMA must be approved before the device can be commercialized.

The Vivos Guides are registered with the FDA as Class I devices for orthodontic tooth positioning. The DNA appliance® is registered with the FDA as a Class I device for expansion and is currently used by Vivos-trained clinicians accordingly.
 
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. We do not have any Class III devices.
 
PMA Pathway
 
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA application, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA application, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers.
 
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported a PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition a PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA application, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA application are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies us that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may require a response on such deficiencies or permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 
Post-market Regulation
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
● | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not have to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; 
● | the federal False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that claim includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statute; 
● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices; 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
● | complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); 
● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

 
We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the quality system regulation (“QSR”), which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation, and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls or a public warning letter that could harm both our reputation and sales. Any potential consequences of off-label use of the DNA appliance are the responsibility of the treating independent dentist; however, we may face consequences related to such off-label use. See “Risk Factors— The misuse or off-label use of The Vivos Method may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.”

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
● | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMAs that have already been granted; 
● | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or 
● | criminal prosecution. 

 
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA
 
There is currently no premarket government review of medical devices in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive. There is also a directive specifically addressing Active Implantable Medical Devices (Directive 90/385/EEC). The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
 
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a “Notified Body”. Notified Bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.

In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive, Annex 7 of the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
 
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
 

● | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
● | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
● | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and 
● | strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. 

 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
 

● | design, development, manufacturing and testing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | product standards; 
● | product safety; 
● | product safety reporting; 
● | marketing, sales and distribution; 
● | packaging and storage requirements; 
● | labeling requirements; 
● | content and language of instructions for use; 
● | clinical trials; 
● | record keeping procedures; 
● | advertising and promotion; 
● | recalls and field corrective actions; 
● | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; 
● | import and export restrictions; 
● | tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements; 
● | registration for reimbursement; 
● | necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees; and 
● | the time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.

The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective in May 2020. The revised regulation includes further controls and requirements on the following activities:
 

● | high level of request for premarket clinical evidence for high-risk devices; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increased scrutiny of technical files for implantable devices; 
● | monitoring of notified bodies, by independent auditors; 
● | increased requirements regarding vigilance and product traceability (specifically related to labeling requirements); and 
● | increased regulation for non-traditional roles such as importer and distributor. 

Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
 
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the United State Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) issued regulations in July 1991, which DHHS has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fall within an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
 
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
 
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, the FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
 
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
 
HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many U.S. states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”), for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members), certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that Is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1,150,000). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statement in such reports. With some exceptions, the information that manufacturers report is made publicly available.

Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, in the United States.
 
HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requires certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA also requires business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to PHI in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity, of covered entities to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
 
The HIPAA privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of a business associate. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose protected health information is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than protected health information as defined under HIPAA.
 
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information, or PHI. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to DHHS, Office of Civil Rights, which would post the violation on its website, and to the media. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $59,522 per violation, not to exceed $1,785,651 per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.
 
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of DHHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities, such as us, and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks DHHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.

In the European Union, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of both our employees and our customers, including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws implementing each of them. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the Data Protection Directive and E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
 
The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on legal grounds set out in the local laws and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected, be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use sensitive data relating to living individuals (for example, patients’ health or medical information), more stringent rules apply, limiting the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates).
 
The new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the current data protection laws issued by each EU member state based on the Directive 95/46/EC. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at national level), the GDPR text is directly applicable in each EU member state, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR are significant—the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business.
 
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
 
We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation.

Healthcare Reform
 
Economic, political and regulatory influences are continuously causing fundamental changes in the healthcare industry in the United States. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system. These reforms, contained primarily in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) and its companion act, the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), significantly altered the U.S. healthcare system by authorizing, among many other things: (i) increased access to health insurance benefits for the uninsured and underinsured populations; (ii) new facilitators and providers of health insurance, as well as new health insurance purchasing access points (i.e., exchanges); (iii) incentives for certain employer groups to purchase health insurance for their employees; (iv) opportunities for subsidies to certain qualifying individuals to help defray the cost of premiums and other out-of-pocket costs associated with the purchase of health insurance, and over the longer term; and (v) mechanisms to foster alternative payment and reimbursement methodologies focused on outcomes, quality and care coordination. In addition, certain states in which we operate are periodically considering various healthcare reform proposals.
 
Since their passage in 2010, the Health Reform Laws have triggered many changes to the U.S. healthcare system, some of which took effect (e.g., the subsequently eliminated individual mandate penalty) while others have continued to be delayed and subsequently repealed (e.g., the medical device tax). The Health Reform Laws also have faced several challenges and remain subject to ongoing efforts to repeal or modify the laws. For example, President Trump issued an Executive Order 13765 (Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal) on January 20, 2017 granting authority to certain executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic burden of the PPACA. However, President Biden revoked this Executive Order on January 28, 2021 (as part of President Biden’s Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act) and directed heads of departments to “consider whether to suspend, revise, or rescind — and, as applicable, publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding” actions taken by the Trump Administration which may hinder the operation of the Health Reform Laws.
 
Nevertheless, the core tenets of the Health Reform Laws remain in effect with several exceptions. The individual mandate penalty was eliminated beginning in 2019 through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was signed into law which repealed several provisions that were included in the Health Reform Laws to pay for the increased federal spending associated with the Health Reform Laws. Specifically, Congress: (i) repealed the Medical Device Excise Tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on manufacturers, producers and importers of certain medical devices; (ii) repealed the health insurance tax, which applies to most fully insured plans, beginning in 2021; and (iii) repealed the so-called Cadillac Tax, which imposed an excise tax of 40% on premiums for employer-sponsored individuals and families that exceeded a certain minimum threshold. Prior to these changes Congress had passed a short-term spending bill as part of the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2018 that delayed the implementation of these provisions and eliminated the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was a 15- member panel of healthcare experts created by the Health Reform Laws and tasked with making annual cost-cutting recommendations for Medicare if Medicare spending exceeded a specified growth rate.
 
The Health Reform Laws have also been the subject of litigation. In particular, in 2019, a collection of 20 state governors and state attorneys general (subsequently two states have dropped out) filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the Northern District of Texas seeking to enjoin the entire Health Reform Laws following the elimination of the individual mandate penalty. The District Court ruled that without the penalty the individual mandate was unconstitutional and further held that all other provisions of the Health Reform Laws should be overturned as well. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the trial court’s decision; however, instead of deciding whether the rest of the PPACA must be struck down, the 5th Circuit sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis. In March of 2020 the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the case and heard oral arguments on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing and reversed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment in respect to standing, vacated the Fifth Circuit’s judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the case. Subsequently the Fifth Circuit vacated the judgement of the District Court in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss. The District Court finally dismissed the case on July 27, 2021.

The Trump Administration made a number of changes that have affected the individual and small group exchange markets, including modifications to the open enrollment periods, funding cuts to patient support resources, including the patient navigator program, and failing to issue cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers participating in the exchanges. In June 2018, the Trump Administration published a final rule that allows small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together to create associations that are considered “employers” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) such that these associations are eligible to access large group health plans, which are typically less expensive and are not subject to as many of the consumer protections imposed by the PPACA on small group and individual health plans. In addition, the Trump Administration published a final rule which makes short term, limited duration plans more accessible, providing individuals with another product offering that is generally less expensive but has fewer protections than under the PPACA plans. This final rule combined with the association health plan final rule, may increase instability in the healthcare exchanges by siphoning off potentially healthier people from the risk pool. However, in 2021 President Biden issued an Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, directing heads of departments to review and potentially revoke or revise these Trump-era actions. In light of the ongoing efforts to alter the Health Reform Laws, we are unable at this time to predict the full impact that potential changes will have on our business, including provisions in the Health Reform Laws related to Medicare payments, mechanisms to foster alternative payment and reimbursement methodologies focused on outcomes, quality and care coordination, Medicare enrollment and claims submission requirements and revisions to other federal healthcare laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the federal False Claims Act.
 
We anticipate, however, that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies, and that public debate regarding these issues will continue in the future. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws can have a substantial effect on permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business in the healthcare industry, and the amount of reimbursement available from government and other payors. Any repeal or modification of the Health Reform Laws may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. In addition, the potential proposals for alternative legislation to replace the Health Reform Laws may have an adverse impact on our business
 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
 
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 158 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good but we do have a Whistleblower Hotline setup for employees to confidentially report concerns. Of our current employees, approximately, nine are part of finance and accounting, 11 are involved in senior management, 19 in sales and marketing, one in research, development and regulatory and 118 in operations.
 
We value the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees and we believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages. We traditionally will benchmark compensation with external sources to verify positions are paid in-line with the market. Our corporate culture is built on passion – we believe in the company’s vision of ridding the world of sleep apnea and hire employees who want to share that same passion. We hold annual company-wide trainings and host regularly scheduled management meetings where management communicates notable corporate developments to be disseminated to employees, as well as a periodic corporate all hands meetings. We are always looking for additional ways to diversify our workforce. We will continue to promote a work environment that is based on the fundamental principles of human dignity, equality and mutual respect. In addition, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have required personal protective equipment for patient-facing employees in addition to requiring daily health questionnaires and temperature checks. Many employees work remotely and we have limited travel as a result of the pandemic. We will continue to support our workforce during these unprecedented circumstances to ensure their safety and well-being.

Corporate History 
 
Formation
 
We were originally organized on July 7, 2016 in Wyoming as Corrective BioTechnologies, Inc. On September 6, 2016, we changed our name from Corrective BioTechnologies, Inc. to Vivos BioTechnologies, Inc. On March 2, 2018, we changed our name from Vivos BioTechnologies, Inc. to Vivos Therapeutics, Inc. During our formation in 2016, we issued an aggregate of 933,334 shares of common stock to a group of our founders, including Summit Capital USA (now Upeva, Inc., 666,667 shares), Regal Capital Venture Partners LLC (166,667 shares) and Thomas P. Madden (100,000 shares) at a purchase price of $0.0003 per share (for an aggregate of $280 of proceeds).
Acquisition of BioModeling Solutions, Inc. and First Vivos, Inc.
 
In August and September 2016, we completed, by way of a share exchange, an agreement to acquire the business and operations of (1) BMS (now a wholly-owned subsidiary), which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of our patented DNA appliance® and FDA cleared mRNA appliance® (collectively with special proprietary treatment protocols comprises The Vivos Method), and (2) First Vivos, Inc., a Texas corporation (“First Vivos”), which proposed to develop and operate a retail chain of Vivos Centers with specially trained dentists that offer The Vivos Method and corroborating physicians. In connection with the share exchange with BMS, we issued 3,333,334 shares of common stock to the shareholders of BMS (including, but not limited to, Dr. G. Dave Singh, our founder and former Chief Medical Officer and director, who received 3,219,705 shares) in exchange for 12,423,500 shares of BMS, which constitutes 100% ownership interest in BMS. In connection with the share exchange with First Vivos, we issued 3,333,334 shares of common stock to the shareholders of First Vivos (including, but not limited to, R. Kirk Huntsman, our co-founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who received 1,833,334 shares) in exchange for 5,000 shares of First Vivos, which constitutes 100% ownership interest in First Vivos.
 
The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, with BMS as the acquirer for financial reporting and accounting purposes. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the historical financial statements of BMS became our historical financial statements and continued to be recorded at their historical carrying amounts.
 
Adoption of Stock and Option Award Plan
 
On April 18, 2019, our stockholders approved the adoption of a stock and option award plan (the “2019 Plan”), under which 333,334 shares were reserved for future issuance for options, restricted stock awards and other equity awards. On June 18, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan to increase the number shares or our common stock available for issuance thereunder by 833,333 share of common stock such that, after amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan, 1,166,667 shares of common stock will be available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan permits grants of equity awards to employees, directors, consultants and other independent contractors.
Approval of Transfer of Corporate Domicile and Reverse Stock Split
 
On April 18, 2019, our stockholders voted to authorize our board of directors to recapitalize our common stock by way of reverse stock split at a ratio of up to one for three. In addition, on such date, our shareholders also authorized our board of directors to transfer our corporate domicile from Wyoming to another U.S. state. Our board of directors elected not to implement the reverse stock split transfer of corporate domicile at that time.
 
Effective August 12, 2020, we transferred our corporate domicile and became a Delaware corporation pursuant to Section 17-16-1720 of the Wyoming Business Corporation Act and Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As a result of the transfer of corporate domicile, each share of capital stock of Vivos Wyoming became a share of capital stock of Vivos Delaware on a one-to-one basis, and such shares shall carry the same terms in all material respects as the shares of Vivos Wyoming. The transfer of corporate domicile has heretofore been approved by the board of directors and majority shareholders of Vivos Wyoming.
 
On July 30, 2020, prior to the transfer of our corporate domicile from Wyoming to Delaware, Vivos Wyoming we implemented a one-for-three reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock pursuant to which holders of Vivos Wyoming’s outstanding common stock received one share of common stock for every three shares of common stock held. Unless the context expressly dictates otherwise, all references to share and per share amounts referred to in this Annual Report reflect the reverse stock split.
