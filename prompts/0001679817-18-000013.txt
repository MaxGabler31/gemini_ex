We are a start-up company, which is in the business of renting out bicycles, Segways and related equipment. To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum funding of $40,000 for the next twelve months. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any additional revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for SEC filing requirements.

The Companys registration address is located at P.O. Box 1408, 5348 Vegas drive 89108 Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include:  (i)      Formation of the Company;  (ii)   Development of our 12 moth business plan;  (iii)  Leasing a place to offer, store and service our equipment; (iv)  Purchasing our operating equipment; (v)   Website creation; (vi)  Signing service agreements with our first customers.    INITIAL FOCUS OF OUR BUSINESS
    Newmarkt Corp. represents itself as bicycle and Segway renting out company. We are offering such service to touristic companies at the moment where tourists, friends, families can organize, plan, develop their own unique vacation on bikes and Segway for a long time, just for a day or for a couple of hours.     We are in the early stages of developing our growing plan to offer a rent bicycle service in Lithuania. We believe that the fact that the city of Vilnius, where we are starting our business, is popular among tourists gives the Company more opportunities to succeed.     We currently have some revenues and some operating history. The Company currently has two major customers to work with. We expect to get other customers and expand our service sales and our operations by the end of the fiscal year. Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our offering is to develop and establish our bicycles renting business by establishing our second and third office, developing our website, attempting to enter into more supply agreements with prospective distributors and manufacturers of bicycles and Segways, engage in advertising and marketing activities and hire personal and sales service specialist.     4  
         Newmarkt Corp. is currently in negotiations with two potential customers Trav Lt and Around Lithuania travel agencies, which are interested in our service and we are planning to sing service agreements with them in the very near future.       EQUIPMENT
    We believe that rental bicycle has never been more in demand these days now that gas prices are rising, and tourists would rather rent bicycles rather than cars on a short distance of traveling. Our most obvious startup requirements for a renting business are bicycles, Segways and safety equipment. We consider the fact that cycling can be dangerous and in this case we will provide our customers with helmets and safety equipment. The Company does not maintain any liability insurance with customer injuries while renting your equipment.     The Company is planning to expand the range of offered equipment. There will be dual wheels self-balancing electric scooter, balancing electronic skateboards; additional safety equipment is accordance to purchased units of equipment and initial spare parts.
