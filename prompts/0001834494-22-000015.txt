BUSINESS
Our Vision and Mission 
At MeridianLink, our vision is to transform financial services technology for the better and our mission is to democratize financial services technology and data so our customers can focus on what’s truly important: their employees, clients, and communities.
Who We Are
We are an industry-trusted software and services company, having earned our market-leading position by serving financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, specialty lending providers, and consumer reporting agencies (“CRAs”), for more than 23 years. With MeridianLink, our customers can accelerate their digital transformation and better serve their clients. We support our customers’ digital transformations by helping them create a superior client experience with our mission-critical lending, account opening, and data verification software solutions. Our solutions allow our customers to meet their clients’ needs across the institution, which enables improved client acquisition and retention. Additionally, our solutions allow our customers to operate more efficiently.
Our lending software solutions provide a fully digital workflow for our customers, extending from their clients’ initial account opening applications to our customers’ final extension of credit and, where necessary, collections activity. We enable our customers to offer a wide array of products and services to new and existing clients, replacing traditional manual processing and less nimble in-house solutions. Our solutions address nearly all categories of consumer lending, including mortgage, credit card, personal, auto, home equity, and small business loans, and provide the software tools and data necessary to deliver automated decisioning.
Our data verification software solutions enable our customers to service their clients and make smarter business decisions by retrieving verification data for credit, income, employment, property, and fraud prevention. Mortgage Credit Link is a versatile, stable, and powerful web-based fulfillment hub for consumer data verification. To capitalize on the credit bureaus and other available sources, financial institutions of all sizes turn to MeridianLink to optimize scoring attribute and data management. Instead of investing in wasted development time, customers connect to a single API to access credit and verification data from dozens of resellers and service providers. 
When it comes to background screening, MeridianLink customers can leverage their TazWorks software as a comprehensive screening software solution with productivity and mobile engagement tools. The TazCloud platform provides a comprehensive technology solution for the background screening industry with a powerful suite of background screening applications, integrations, and advanced business intelligence tools to help customers make better decisions about their business. 
We offer our software solutions using a software-as-a service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions and typically have multi-year contracts with an initial term of three years. Our customer contracts are typically not cancellable without penalty. Our subscription fee revenues include annual base fees, platform partner fees, and, depending on the solution, fees per search, per loan application, or per closed loan (with some contractual minimums based on volume) that are charged on a monthly basis, which we refer to as volume-based fees. We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementations and customer support services which we believe drive higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. We plan to continue investing in migrating our non-legacy lending and data verification software solutions onto a single platform resident in a public cloud and driving product development to further increase customer cross-selling and retention. We believe that our increased focus on our go-to-market strategy and partnerships will drive incremental opportunities for revenue and accelerate customer cross-sell growth.

Who We Serve
We have had the privilege of helping our customers to revamp their lending and account opening processes, reduce operational costs, and increase revenue. Our diverse client base includes banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, specialty lending providers, and CRAs. As of December 31, 2021, our customer mix includes over 70 of the leading 100 credit unions per Credit Unions Online, and a majority of the financial institutions on Forbes’ 2021 lists of America’s Best Credit Unions and Banks. Our broad reach provides connections to over 600,000 active system users, who are individuals who have accessed one of our solutions in the 90 days prior to our measurement period of January 10, 2022.
We focus our efforts on financial institutions, but our addressable market also includes specialty lending customers that target consumer credit opportunities. Specialty lending companies drive higher per customer application volume and help diversify our end-markets. Our technology enables our customers to bridge the functional silos of their institutions and thereby increase their ability to serve more of their clients’ needs and achieve incremental revenue.
History
We have expanded our offerings and customer base through a combination of in-house initiatives and acquisitions to support continuous innovation for our customers’ benefit. For approximately our first two decades, our expansion was driven by internal product initiatives and market development. Immediately after the investment by Thoma Bravo UGP, LLC and its affiliated entities, or Thoma Bravo, into MeridianLink in May 2018, we acquired CRIF Corporation, or CRIF, in June 2018. 
In November 2020, we acquired Teledata Communications, Inc., or TCI. TCI is the creator of DecisionLender, a SaaS loan origination solution that was first released in 1998. DecisionLender is an industry-trusted LOS that primarily serves the indirect lending needs of banks, credit unions, and financial companies nationwide. 
In December 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets of TazWorks, LLC, or TazWorks. TazWorks is the creator of TazCloud, an end-to-end technology solution for the background screening industry. TazWorks provides us with capabilities that are highly complementary to our Mortgage Credit Link offering, enabling us to provide our CRA customers with a more complete solution.
In April of 2021, we acquired Saylent Technologies, Inc., or Saylent. Saylent is a data analytics and marketing solution that offers insights to financial institutions that help drive account and credit and debit card usage. They determine the ideal target audiences, craft customized marketing campaigns and put them in action with fully automated, multi-channel outreach.

Growth Strategy
We believe there are significant growth opportunities driven by end-market expansion and geographic extension. We seek to capture additional growth driven by new logo acquisition, organic cross-sell and upsell opportunities with our customers, and potential acquisitions. We intend to continue growing our business by executing on the following strategies:
•Continue adding customers in our target market. We believe there is untapped market potential in the loan origination and digital banking markets. Significant runway exists as financial institutions begin to adopt online lending and account opening practices and require more efficient technologies. We provide these services to institutions of all sizes and complexities. By focusing on better sales execution, providing and allocating resources where needed, and improving marketing efforts, we are confident in our ability to expand our customer base within our target market.
•Expanding our target market. Our current focus is on the middle-market, catering predominantly to financial institutions such as community banks and credit unions with assets under management between $100 million and $10 billion. We believe a large opportunity exists in expanding our target market to new customers with less than $100 million or greater than $10 billion in assets under management. In our down market, smaller institutions commonly use spreadsheets or other inexpensive alternatives. These companies have a smaller volume of loans per month, but we have developed targeted solution packages with lower implementation fees to address their primary needs.
•Pursue unrealized upsell and cross-sell into client base. Our go-to-market strategy and partnerships drive incremental revenue and client cross-sell growth. We have demonstrated our ability to retain customers with strong annual customer retention and to expand existing customers’ solution adoption through upselling and cross-selling. We believe there is further opportunity to expand within and across our existing customer base by cross-selling all consumer loan types, upselling modules of existing products, and promoting the adoption of new products. Further, our transaction-based pricing structure means that our revenue opportunity grows along with our customers’ volumes.
•Launch new products. We are focused on introducing new solutions and enhancing services and capabilities in areas including digital lending, data insights, collections, data verification, and marketing automation to further expand our reach into the consumer and commercial lending and background screening markets. We are enhancing our offerings to create additional value for new and existing customers in order to increase our share-of-wallet and further distance ourselves from our competition. In 2021, we continued to develop our end-to-end platform, MeridianLink One. The platform connects our trusted products into one powerful platform to turn lending automation, cross-selling, and loan optimization into a transformational experience. For more information on this unified, cloud-native SaaS platform, please see the section titled “—Technology and Solutions.”
•Expand monetization of Partner Marketplace. We have designed our solutions to act as the gateway for third parties to access our financial institution and CRA customers, accelerating the loan application and decisioning processes and reducing expenses. We are able to capitalize on one-time service fees, recurring integration fees and ongoing revenue share in platform partner fees. As we grow our business, we expect to bring on board additional vendor partners driving further monetization opportunities. We also intend to cultivate and leverage network partners to grow our market presence and drive greater sales efficiency.
•Selectively pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. In addition to developing our solutions organically, we may selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions that provide additional capabilities or customers, or both. We expect these transactions to focus on innovation to strengthen and expand the functionality and features of our customer solutions suite, gain market share, and/or expand our presence into new markets and geographies. For example, in 2020, we added the indirect lending capabilities of TCI and also acquired the powerful screening platform and API infrastructure from TazWorks, and, in 2021, we acquired Saylent which provides technology we are leveraging in our marketing automation product offering.
Table of Contents

•Full public cloud migration to drive enhanced capacity, flexibility, and security. As we migrate fully to the public cloud, we seek to expand on our successes and deliver an even better experience for our customers, driven by the highly scalable and configurable nature of our platform, regardless of the size and complexity of the financial institution. Customers will have the ability to digitally serve clients, while automation and digitization capabilities reduce duplicative work and increase efficiency. We believe that the full migration of our solutions to a public cloud, from our current private-public cloud hybrid approach, will further enhance the ability of financial institution employees to work from their office or remotely and serve their clients 24/7/365. We believe this migration will help customers further reduce costs through the added upsell and cross-sell capabilities we intend to introduce, as well as allow customers to benefit from public cloud functionality which includes automatic push of new updates from public cloud partners.
•Substantial runway for increasing penetration domestically and enhancing solutions for international expansion. Today, our revenues are all domestic, and the U.S. market provides substantial runway for continued growth. In addition, we believe that enhancing our capabilities to serve customers in international markets represents an opportunity to deliver our solutions and expand our customer base to financial institutions of all sizes and complexities around the world.
Technology and Solutions
Our software provides our customers with an end-to-end solution that improves workflow within a financial institution. Our solutions are not only focused on driving increased loan origination and partner interactions at each digital touch point, but also help our customers simplify how loans are processed and decisioned, so that increased client volume does not materially increase costs incurred by our customers. This enhanced efficiency enabled by the improved workflow we facilitate allows our customer to improve their financial performance. Our actively marketed solutions and services include both Lending Software Solutions and Data Verification Software Solutions. Our Software Solutions include:
•Point of Sale Systems;
•Account Opening Software;

Table of Contents

Our technologies directly connect our financial institution customers and the clients they serve, creating an omni-channel experience by integrating all potential client touch points onto a single platform. We provide software solutions that simplify loan decisioning, deposit and loan origination, and workflow by providing accurate information within a streamlined user-friendly platform. Our solutions were designed by bankers who understand how financial institutions work and have been built to consistently drive value through increased profitability and efficiency while facilitating regulatory compliance. With a broad set of integrated third-party capabilities and a robust underwriting and pricing engine, our solutions can be configured to fit the needs of a wide variety of financial institutions. In connection with our ongoing development and launch of MeridianLink One, in February 2021, we introduced a product-wide rebranding of our offerings under the unified brand of MeridianLink. Our rebranded core offerings include our Lending Software Solutions and our Data Verification Software Solutions as follows:
Lending Software Solutions
MeridianLink One
We continue to expand our next generation platform, MeridianLink One – a unified, cloud-native SaaS platform. This all-in-one digital lending and deposit account opening platform is powered by a smart cross-sell optimization engine. The platform spans mortgage and consumer loan origination, offering enhanced transparency and efficiency to process loans. We are designing a proprietary smart debt optimization engine to deepen the integration of our data verification and LOS solutions to empower loan officers to maximize loan acceptance rates, boost cross-sell opportunities, and deepen their relationships with clients. Additionally, the platform provides access to our large network of third-party integrations and further accelerate the loan process and reduce expenses for our customers.
Point of Sale System
We offer a Point of Sale system that allows financial institutions, regardless of size, to easily expand existing lending and deposit account origination platforms to online consumers while ensuring control of the entire online application experience. From the ability to determine which loan and deposit account applications to make available online, to customizing the look and feel to match an existing web presence, our system has hundreds of configurations available to tailor the online application process to meet a financial institution’s business objectives. Our system is the consumer touch point and funnel for consumer loans by integrating seamlessly with the all-in-one platform consumer LOS and account opening software so that online applications route securely and reliably into the customer’s existing platform. We currently offer this through our MeridianLink Portal product.
Account Opening Software
We offer a comprehensive cloud-based online account opening and deposit software solution. The platform unifies deposit account opening and funding for all channels and product types. With robust functionality ranging from identity verification, OFAC checks, e-signature, switch kits, and core system connectivity, our platform saves operational costs and increases customer satisfaction from application initiation to account creation. We currently offer this through our MeridianLink Opening product.
Consumer LOS
We offer LOS software that provides a full loan solution suite to banks and credit unions. Our solution offers automated underwriting and pricing for indirect loans (auto and retail), consumer lending (direct auto, unsecured and secured personal loans), lines of credit, business loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and vehicle leases. As a single loan origination system, our software consolidates applications from all channels, applying the same rules and processes to ensure a streamlined process for institutional staff and a user-friendly consumer experience for customers. The solution provides a frictionless experience by consolidating data from all existing channels—mobile, online, branch, call center, indirect, retail, and kiosk—into a unified consumer experience. The modern, intuitive, and efficient UI makes everyday transaction processing easier. In addition, our cross-sell engine identifies potential cross-sell opportunities, such as credit card debt consolidation or auto loan refinancing, for our customers. Our consumer LOS is offered as MeridianLink Consumer.
Table of Contents

Mortgage LOS
We offer cloud-based software designed for financial professionals to optimize the end-to-end mortgage loan origination process. We use automation, technology, and a dedicated support staff to help lenders deliver fast and compliant loans. This includes a complete decision engine that provides deep credit analysis, automated condition generation, and automated fee calculations – all of which increase the efficiency of the origination. Our suite of tools (including Open API, PriceMyLoan, eDocs, and web portals) allows for individual customization while enabling regulatory compliance. We currently offer this through our MeridianLink Mortgage product.
Collection Software
We offer a web-based debt collection software that helps customers easily and efficiently manage delinquencies. The software provides benefits with a sleek UI that is simple to use, allowing users to be quickly trained to set up and to manage the product. It replaces tedious workflows with automation, sophisticated analytics, and easy-to-use functionality. The collection software is offered as MeridianLink Collect.
Analytics and Business Intelligence
We offer a range of solutions that deliver the quality and expertise of an internal team through agile tools. Our analytics tools are aimed at maximizing our customers’ credit portfolio performance through tailored services as well as allowing our customers to make better and faster business decisions. The solutions are designed with interactive visualizations and various filter dimensions to enable our customers to optimize their experience. We provide intuitive dashboards, easy-to-read reports, and a powerful exploratory sandbox, presenting a comprehensive solution for a multi-level audience while providing insights for omni-channel execution. Our analytics and business intelligence tools are currently offered through MeridianLink Engage, MeridianLink Consulting, and MeridianLink Insight.
Data Verification Software Solutions
We offer a plug-and-play, cloud-based order fulfillment hub for bankers and credit officers. Our software simplifies product ordering with an intuitive web interface and integrated tools for order fulfillment. The solution provides users access to a large network of consumer credit, data, and verification service providers and allows them to process credit, income verification, employment, criminal and rental history, and other related services. A comprehensive list of product and service APIs allows for integrations into a number of applications for a seamless experience to minimize human error and to reduce costs. Our Data Verification Software Solutions are currently offered through Mortgage Credit Link, TazCloud, and Credit API.
Additional Solutions
In addition to the solutions listed above, we support additional loan origination systems, other credit decisioning tools, and additional solution modules. Several of these additional solutions, including ACTion, LCC/Appro, BizMark/Mark4, Sail/Teres, and Synergy, came to us via acquisitions, and we are proud of the legacy of these solutions and committed to ensuring the best journey for these customers. Wherever possible, we seek to make available the capabilities and innovations of our new solutions to those customers on older versions of our solutions.
Financial Model and Key Metrics
Our revenues are broken out between three components: subscription fees, professional services, and other revenues. Our subscription fees consist of revenues from software solutions that typically are multi-year contracts with an initial term of three years. Our customer contracts are typically not cancellable without penalty. Our subscription fee revenues include annual base fees, platform partner fees, and, depending on the solution, fees per search or per loan application or per closed loan (with some contractual minimums based on volume) that are charged on a monthly basis, which we refer to as volume-based fees. Our professional service fees are driven by professional services for the setup and configuration of platform modules for customer needs as well as certain consulting engagements regarding best practices and analytics. Our other fees consist of one-time and recurring fees that include implementation fees, annual fees, and revenue sharing based on revenue generated, applications or loans, or some combination of the above.
Table of Contents

We have high customer and revenue retention due to the nature of the services we provide. Customer onboarding and loan origination workflows within financial institutions are complicated with significant compliance requirements and often require integration with legacy systems that are highly customized and fragmented.
Our pricing model provides us with several monetization opportunities to receive revenues in excess of what is contractually committed by our customers. Current pricing requires a contractual commitment for a minimum revenue amount, which correlates to an allowable amount of applications in that month. Customers can achieve lower per application pricing by contracting for a higher monthly revenue commitment. Customers pay on a per transaction basis if their volume surpasses their minimum commitment level. For non-mortgage consumer loans, including personal loans, auto loans, and credit cards, clients pay per-application, regardless of whether the application is accepted or denied. For our mortgage loan product, clients pay per-funded loans. Contract length with clients is usually three years, but can range from one to seven years.
An additional opportunity for generating revenues in excess of what is contractually committed is through our Partner Marketplace. Through reseller and referral relationships, we receive revenues based on our customers’ use of a partner’s services. In many instances, our partners have their own sales and marketing efforts targeted at our customers – and when those third-party sales efforts are successful for our partners, it also generates fees for us. We also market our partners’ solutions to our customers as a way to generate revenues, and also to ensure that our customers are leveraging the full benefit of our solution, which includes the capabilities offered through our partners.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales team primarily consists of our new logo sales team, which focus on selling into accounts that currently do not have a relationship with us, and our account manager sales team, which sell into existing customer accounts. Both sales teams are supported by our sales engineers, who demonstrate the functionality of our solutions to prospects, and our sales operations team which manages reporting, analytics, and sales enablement.
Our new logo team is responsible for expanding our customer base. This team is trained to nurture our customer prospects, including through discovery of such prospects’ currently implemented solutions, if any, and through demonstration of the capabilities our solutions offer and the potential benefits to the customer prospect if they implement our solutions from us.
Our account manager team maintains close relationships with existing customers and act as advisors to each customer, helping them identify and understand their specific needs, challenges, goals, and opportunities with the intention to expand the breadth of our solutions the customer currently uses. It is the role of this team to ensure that our existing customers get the maximum benefit from the breadth of the solutions we provide.
We also have a sales team supporting our channel partners to ensure they receive the sales support that is required to capitalize on prospects that are identified through the partner’s selling efforts. The channel sales team also seeks to identify new potential channel partners who can expand the breadth of our reach to potential prospects.
To build brand awareness and generate sales leads, we conduct digital marketing campaigns, webinars, public relations campaigns, lead development activities, and advertising through multiple avenues, including industry publications and conferences. We have also historically hosted an in-person annual user forum to foster a customer community, showcase our most recent solution enhancements, and engage in a discussion on the direction and roadmap of our solutions. The user forums in 2020 and 2021 were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our technology. We utilize agile software development methodologies and industry best practices, such as continuous integration/continuous deployment, automated testing, and distributed version control, to develop new functionality and enhance our existing solution.
Table of Contents

Competition
We face competition for our solutions from a wide range of offerings from manual in-house processes to similar functionality bundled with a core solution to separate point solutions to other competitors who have a similar solution approach as we do. While this competition impacts each of the markets we target, we do not believe there are any competitors that provide all of the solutions and connections that we provide. We compete in a variety of categories, particularly: Consumer Loan Origination and associated functionality, Mortgage Loan Origination, and Data Verification. We believe we have a strong and defensible position in our target market due to the breadth of our capabilities, the depth of our functionality (developed and enhanced throughout our multi-decade history), our integration across consumer loan types, our Partner Marketplace, and our ability to deliver value through workflow efficiency and the expertise available through our services and support teams.
Consumer Loan Origination
Our main source of competition in the consumer loan origination market are the similar capabilities offered by a customer’s core banking system provider, such as Fiserv, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS, Jack Henry & Associates, and Temenos. Other financial technology software companies, such as nCino and Q2, also have competitive functionality. Additionally, we compete with customers who have a narrower focus like CU Direct’s Lending 360 product and Sync1 Systems product offering. Financial institutions rely on streamlined consumer lending origination software in order to accurately and efficiently gather the data needed to open and process all types of accounts and loans. We believe our SaaS-based end-to-end origination solution for all new consumer loan and deposit applications allows us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
Mortgage Loan Origination
Our primary competitors in the mortgage loan origination market are Calyx, Intercontinental Exchange, OpenClose, Mortgage Cadence, and, to a lesser extent, Black Knight. The capabilities provided by a mortgage loan origination system is a point of focus for financial institutions as rising mortgage loan volume and origination costs continue to drive demand for systems that optimize lending decisions and loan composition in an automated, accurate manner. We believe we have a competitive advantage through our offering of a full cloud, SaaS-decision engine to support every aspect of the mortgage loan origination process.
Data Verification
We compete with both direct competitors and vendors who have developed proprietary in-house solutions that replicate the functionality of our Data Verification Software Solution. CRAs that have developed proprietary in-house credit reporting capabilities include CoreLogic and CBC Innovis and proprietary in-house background screening capabilities include HireRight and Checkr. We have a limited number of competitors that provide a platform solution similar to the capabilities of MeridianLink Mortgage Credit Link but there is more direct competition in background screening, including Accio and Deverus. The delivery of secure and accurate data from disparate sources to institutions has become increasingly important as they rely more on independent verification services. We believe we distinguish ourselves in this area by providing instant access to a rapidly growing network of consumer credit, data, and verification service providers, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product features, performance, and effectiveness;
•solution line breadth, depth, and continuity; 
•reliability and security;
•cloud-based technology platform and subscription pricing model;
•quality of implementation and customer support services;
•capability for configuration, integration, and scalability;
•ease of use and efficient workflows;
•level of customer satisfaction;
Table of Contents

•price, commercial model, and total cost of use;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•client experience;
•comprehensiveness of solutions; and
•delivery of process automation for financial institutions.
We believe we compete favorably against our competitors based on the factors above and that we distinguish ourselves through our functionality and user design, a culture and history of innovation and client excellence, a track record of developing innovative features, and differentiated, high customer satisfaction. Our success in growing our business will depend on our ability to continue demonstrating to financial institutions that our solution provides superior business outcomes to those of alternative vendors or internally developed systems.
Government Regulation
As a technology service provider to banks and credit unions, we are not required to be chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise our customers and other providers of financial services. The U.S. lending industry is heavily regulated. Originators, lenders, consumer reporting agencies, and service providers with which we do business are subject to federal, state, and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which they operate in the lending industry, including but not limited to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, as amended, the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, as amended, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, as amended, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, or FCRA. Other than our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Professional Credit Reporting Inc., which is a consumer reporting agency and is subject to the FCRA, and MeridianLink Wholesale Data, LLC, a wholesale data company, we are not directly subject to these laws and regulations; however, changes to these laws and regulations could broaden the scope of parties or activities subject to regulation and require us to comply with their restrictions, and new solutions and services developed by us may be subject to, or have to reflect, these laws or regulations. For more information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
Information Security
We have an established information security program aligned to the NIST SP 800-53 standard and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2. Our program is run by our Chief Information Security Officer and implemented by a dedicated information security team. Our solutions currently are hosted in data centers and public cloud providers located in the United States. We monitor our infrastructure for signs of failure and seek to take preemptive action in an effort to minimize and prevent downtime. Our data centers employ advanced measures designed to protect the integrity and security of our data. We have also implemented disaster recovery measures and continue to invest in our data center and other technical infrastructure.
Customer data processed by our servers is encrypted, password protected, and stored on secure servers. Customers transmit data to our servers though a TLS encryption channel, with AES 256-bit ciphers protecting the data against third party disclosure in transit. Data at rest is encrypted utilizing AES 256-bit Key Management Systems. We also employ anti-virus, anti-malware, and advanced threat protection. We engage a third-party auditor to conduct an annual SOC 2 Type 2 audit of our information security program and a PCI-DSS audit of our cardholder data environment.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
The demand for loan originations is affected by consumer demand for personal loans and the market for buying, selling, financing, and/or re-financing assets, which in turn, is affected by the national economy, regional trends, property valuations, interest rates, and socio-economic trends and by state and federal regulations and programs which may encourage or discourage certain purchasing trends. Our business is generally subject to seasonal trends with activity generally decreasing during the winter months, especially home purchase loans and related services. Our lowest revenue levels during the year have historically been in the fourth quarter, but this may not be indicative of future results. 
Table of Contents

Additionally, the timing and amount of any transaction revenues generated in excess of the contractually committed monthly minimum fee can be subject to fluctuations of consumer behavior tied to seasonality as well as macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer loan volumes. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers also are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our sales. Sales may tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in subsequent quarters, but any resulting impact on our results of operation has been difficult to measure due to the timing of our implementations and overall growth in our business. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers, and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their clients. As a result, we and our customers are very deliberate and careful in our implementation activities to help ensure a successful roll-out of the solutions to their clients. Unusually long or short implementations, for even a small number of customers, may result in short-term quarterly variability in our results of operations.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, rights under trade secret laws, patents, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, as well as other legal and contractual rights, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the market. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patent potential of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we have a total of 18 registered trademarks in the United States. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.meridianlink.com and other variations, including domains from acquisitions. Additionally, on February 15, 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued to MeridianLink U.S. Patent Number 11,250,505. The patent is titled “Optimizing Loan Opportunities in a Loan Origination Computing Environment” and relates to MeridianLink’s loan origination platforms.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, if we were to expand internationally, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increase. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. Any third-party intellectual property claims against us could significantly increase our expenses and could have a significant and negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our success is due in large part to the drive, creativity, and the overall strength of our workforce. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 622 employees all operating within the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. Based on employee surveys and feedback, we believe that our employee relations are strong.

Health Safety and Wellness
The health and safety of our colleagues and anyone who enters any of our workplaces is of paramount importance to us. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a work from home policy beginning in 2020 to keep our employees safe in accordance with local and national health agency guidelines. We immediately created a COVID-19 committee consisting of executive leaders who communicated frequently regarding the status and impacts of COVID-19 and on our remote working policies, while initiating new protocols across all offices. We established workplace health and safety standards based on guidance from local public health authorities. We also surveyed our employee base and found that our employees had a strong preference for remote working on a permanent basis. Therefore, we have implemented a company-wide remote-first work strategy and have allowed employees to relocate to areas that they believe will provide a better quality of life for them and their families.
Growth and Development
We foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their career progression through personal and professional development. We have partnered with Udemy to provide a diverse range of virtual training and development programs and on-demand resources that employees can use to excel in their careers and personal life. We also encourage employees to maintain relevant professional credentials and licensing and pay for required continuing education or other professional certification requirements.
We are developing a company-wide wellness program to encourage healthy habits and personal wellness for all our employees, with a particular focus on mental health and well-being. Our program will include stress reduction programs and tools, nutrition education, fitness challenges, and incentives.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation program is designed to attract, reward, and retain talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business, contribute to our strategic goals, and create long-term value for our stockholders. We believe that our employees should have a strong work/life balance, develop and grow personally and professionally, and be able to save for their future. We provide employees with industry-competitive compensation and benefits, including retirement savings programs, the opportunity to invest in MeridianLink at a discount through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and medical, dental, vision, and life and disability plans.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment consisting of diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better and more innovative products, and is important to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. In 2022, we will focus on building an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce through a variety of company initiatives, such as training for employees around diversity and inclusion-related topics intended to create a culture of belonging. We will also provide resources and training to employees to ensure that as we continue to grow, we are adopting and following best practices for hiring.
Employee Engagement
Listening to our employees is a core component of our employee engagement strategy. Being able to understand the needs, wants, preferences, and feedback of our employees is critical to the design of our employee programs. We hold regular all-hands updates to welcome new employees, celebrate milestone anniversaries, and provide important business updates. We survey our employees regularly through pulse style surveys on a range of topics, as well as an annual survey conducted by a third-party organization. Our leadership team carefully considers the feedback received from these surveys and focuses on making changes to become a better place to work for our employees.
We hold an annual all-employee event, MeridianLinkED, where we spend two days sharing future priorities, cross-pollinating team members in fun and professional activities, and celebrate key wins and accomplishments. We also hold regular engagement events like trivia contests, virtual happy hours and cook outs, guest entertainers, and executive brown-bag lunches.

Giving back to our communities is important to us. That is why every employee is given a paid day each year to volunteer for a 501(c)(3) charity of their choice. We are proud to have earned the Great Place to Work® certification in both 2020 and 2021. We were also recognized in 2020 as the Best Technology Company Leadership team by the High Tech Awards and Octane, Southern California’s leading accelerator organization.
