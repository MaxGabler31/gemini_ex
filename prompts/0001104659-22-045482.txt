Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of targeted immunotherapy using fully human monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, to treat life-threatening infections. mAbs represent a fundamentally new treatment approach in the infectious disease market and are designed to overcome key issues associated with current therapies, including drug resistance, short duration of response, tolerability, negative impact on the human microbiome, and lack of differentiation between treatment alternatives. Our proprietary product pipeline is comprised of fully human mAbs targeting specific pathogens associated with life-threatening bacterial and viral infections, primarily hospital-acquired pneumonia, or HAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or VAP, cystic fibrosis, and COVID-19 Our clinical stage product candidates have exhibited promising preclinical data and clinical data. Our lead product candidate, AR-301, targets the alpha toxin produced by gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus, a

common pathogen associated with HAP and VAP. Current clinical development activities are focused on AR-301, AR-320, AR-701, and AR-501.
The majority of candidates from our product pipeline are derived by employing our differentiated antibody discovery platform called MabIgXTM and lPEXTM. This platform is designed to comprehensively screen the B-cell repertoire and isolate human antibody-producing B-cells from individuals who have either successfully overcome an infection by a particular pathogen or have been vaccinated against a particular pathogen. We believe that B-cells from these patients are the ideal source of highly protective and efficacious mAbs which can been administered safely to other patients. lPEXTM complements and further extends the capabilities of MabIgX to quickly screen large number of antibody producing B-cells from patients and generation of high mAb producing mammalian production cell line at a speed not previously attainable. As a result, we can significantly reduce time for antibody discovery and manufacturing compared to conventional approaches.
Our initial clinical indication for AR-301 is for adjunctive therapeutic treatment with standard of care, or SOC, antibiotics for HAP and VAP. AR-320 is being developed as a pre-emptive treatment of mortality and morbidity associated with HAP and VAP in the intensive care units, or ICUs, remain high despite aggressive treatment with SOC antibiotics. Current SOC antibiotics used to treat HAP and VAP typically involve a combination of several broad spectrum antibiotics that are prescribed empirically at the start of treatment. The specific empirical antibiotic regimens that are prescribed vary widely among physicians, and generally results in modest clinical benefits due to a number of reasons, including the frequent mismatch of the antibiotics regimen to the etiologic agent and/or infection by an antibiotic resistant strain. Recently, rapid diagnostic tests have been introduced that allow the identification of infection-causing agents within hours. These increasingly common tests allow physicians to prescribe a more appropriate antibiotics regimen, and eventually targeted anti-infectives such as AR-301, AR-320, and AR-101 earlier in the course of infection. This evidenced-based treatment approach is designed to remove issues associated with empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics such as inappropriate antibiotic selection and promotion of antibiotic resistance. In contrast to the lack of differentiation among SOC antibiotics, mAbs are highly differentiated from SOC antibiotics in mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, and thus are well suited to complement antibiotics when used together. As an adjunctive treatment, AR-301 has the potential to improve the effectiveness of SOC antibiotics and cover antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains, while not competing directly with antibiotics. To emphasize the benefits of our product candidates as an adjunctive therapy, we design clinical trials based on superiority endpoints.
In July 2021, we announced an in-licensing agreement with MedImmune Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, for the worldwide commercial rights of suvratoxumab, which is a half-life extended fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha toxin produced by S. aureus. This product is given the product code ‘AR-320’. As with AR-301, AR-320’s mode of action is independent of the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus, and it is active against infections caused by both MRSA and MSSA. Suvratoxumab and AR-301 are complementary products. Suvratoxumab’s focus on preventive treatment of S. aureus pneumonia complements Aridis’ AR-301 Phase 3 mAb program which is being developed as a therapeutic treatment of S. aureus pneumonia. We believe that AR-320 will be first-line treatment, first to market, first-in-class pre-emptive treatment of S. aureus colonized patients. The same first-line, first to market and first-in-class strategy applies to the acute treatment with the monoclonal antibody AR-301, which we believe can make us a global leader in this space. 
AR-320 is being developed for pre-emptive treatment of high-risk patients under 65 years old for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite current standard of care, including antibiotics and infection control practices like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundles. Currently, there are no treatments available for prevention or early preemptive management of patients at high-risk of developing S. aureus pneumonia. Suvratoxumab has the potential to address this unmet medical need by reducing the incidence of S. aureus pneumonia in patients at high-risk of developing the disease, e.g., mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are colonized with S. aureus in their respiratory tract.
HAP and VAP pose serious challenges in the hospital setting, as SOC antibiotics are becoming inadequate in treating infected patients. There are approximately 3,000,000 cases of pneumonia reported in the U.S. per year and approximately 628,000 annual cases of HAP and VAP caused by gram negative bacteria and MRSA (DRG, 2016). These patients are typically at high risk of mortality, which is compounded by other life-threatening co-morbidities and the rise in antibiotic resistance. Epidemiology studies estimate that the probability of death attributed to S. aureus ranges from 29% to 55% and for P. aeruginosa ranges from 24% to 76%. In addition, pneumonia infections can prolong patient stays in ICUs and the use of mechanical ventilation, creating a major economic burden on patients, hospital systems and payors. For example, ICU cost of care for a ventilated pneumonia patient is approximately $10,000 per day in the U.S., and the duration of ICU stays are typically twice that of a non-ventilated patient (Infection Control and Hospital 

6



Epidemiology. 2010, vol. 31, pp. 509-515). The average cost of care per pneumonia patient is approximately $41,250 which increases 86% for HAP/VAP patients to approximately $76,730. We estimate that our three clinical mAb candidates have an addressable market of $25 billion and the potential to address approximately 325,000 HAP and VAP patients in the U.S.
Our proprietary pipeline is primarily focused on severe lung infections and is comprised of six wholly-owned product candidates which are highlighted below.

Our Product Pipeline

● | AR-301 is a fully human immunoglobulin 1, or IgG1, mAb targeting the gram-positive bacteria S. aureus alphatoxin. We are developing AR-301 initially as an adjunctive immunotherapy in combination with SOC antibiotics to treat acute pneumonia caused by S. aureus infection. We filed an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND for AR-301 in June 2015. We completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial in 48 HAP and VAP patients. The trial met its primary endpoint of tolerability. AR-301 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, related to the product candidate, and its pharmacokinetic properties were consistent with that of human IgG1. In addition, the trial showed trends towards benefit in various patient benefits related endpoints, including improvements in time on ventilator for VAP patients, microbiological eradication rate, time to microbiological eradication, and overall ICU and hospital stays for AR-301 plus SOC antibiotics compared to antibiotics alone. We initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial in VAP patients in January 2019. AR-301 has been granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA, orphan drug designation in the EU, and has filed for orphan drug designation in the U.S.

● | AR-320 is a fully human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting S. aureus alpha toxin. AR-320 is active against infections caused by both MRSA and MSSA. Suvratoxumab’s focus on preventive treatment of S. aureus pneumonia complements Aridis’ AR-301 Phase 3 mAb program which is being developed as a therapeutic treatment of S. aureus pneumonia. A multinational, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled Phase 2 study conducted by AstraZeneca (n=196 patients) showed that mechanically ventilated ICU patients colonized with S. aureus who are treated with suvratoxumab saw a relative risk reduction of pneumonia by 32% in the overall intend to treat (“ITT”) study population, and by 47% in the prespecified under 65 year old population, which is the target population in the planned Phase 3 study. The relative risk

reduction in the target population reached statistical significance, and was also associated with a substantial reduction in the duration of care needed in the ICU and hospital [see https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30995-6/fulltext].

● | AR-501 (Panaecin) is a broad spectrum small molecule anti-infective we are developing in addition to our targeted mAb product candidates. This product candidate is currently in a Phase 1/2a clinical study and is funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. AR-501 is administered as an inhalable aerosol to treat lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Preclinical studies have shown that mice infected with P. aeruginosa can be rescued with a single inhalation exposure of aerosolized AR-501. We filed the IND application and subsequently initiated a Phase 1/2a trial in December 2018. The Phase 1 portion of the clinical study in healthy adults has been completed and results were reported in 2020. We have initiated a phase 2a clinical study in cystic fibrosis patients in the first half of 2021. AR-501 has been granted Fast-Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations by the FDA.

● | AR-701 is a cocktail of fully human mAbs discovered from convalescent COVID-19 patients that are directed at multiple protein epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is formulated for delivery via intramuscular injection or inhalation using a nebulizer. Both mAbs in the AR-701 cocktail neutralized all authentic SARS-CoV-2 beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and omicron variants in vitro and when used either individually or in combination, conferred complete eradication of virus from Omicron infected mice and protection against disease pathology.

● | AR-401 is our mAb discovery program aimed at treating infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, a gram-negative bacterium that is increasingly prevalent in blood stream, lung, and skin infections. We used our MabIgX technology to identify novel targets and select several fully human mAb candidates that bind to outer membrane proteins of the bacteria. We intend to select a development candidate for additional preclinical studies.

● | AR-101 is a fully human immunoglobulin M, or IgM, mAb targeting the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa serotype O11. We filed an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, or IMPD, with the European Union (EU) in October 2004. We have completed a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults and a Phase 2a trial in 27 HAP and VAP patients. In the Phase 2a trial, AR-101 plus SOC antibiotics was generally well tolerated. The per protocol population (defined as study patients who completed the study without any major protocol deviation) demonstrated numeric improvement over standalone antibiotics across multiple clinical endpoints, including initial clinical resolution rate, time to initial clinical resolution, time on ventilator or in ICU and all-cause mortality was seen. AR-101 has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and in the EU. This program is licensed to the Serum Institute of India and Hepalink.

● | AR-201 is a fully human IgG1 mAb with high affinity for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, glycoprotein F and neutralizes diverse clinical isolates of RSV. In in vivo preclinical studies, AR-201 has shown to be 12-fold more potent than Synagis in a head-to-head comparison study, a currently marketed drug for pediatric RSV. AR-201 has also been shown to bind to RSV strains that are resistant to Synagis. This program is licensed exclusively to the Serum Institute of India.

To date, we have raised over $152 million in public and private investments. Furthermore, we have been able to augment our own financial resources by obtaining approximately $53 million of non-dilutive awards and grants, including approximately $32 million from the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and approximately $12 million from the Department of Defense, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), Gates Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and other strategic research and development collaborations. We believe that our ability to attract significant financial investments and grant funding underscores the recognized need for new anti-infective products and the strength of our product candidate portfolio.
We have assembled a senior management team with substantial product development experience and a successful track record of navigating complex drug development and regulatory pathways. Our management team has over 175 years of combined drug development experience from proven biopharmaceutical companies, such as Abgenix, Inc. Aviron, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, MedImmune (AstraZeneca), and Novartis AG among others, and has contributed to the development and launch of products with multi-billions in annual sales.

Strategy
Our goal is to become a global leader in anti-infective immunotherapy by discovering, developing and commercializing best-in-class mAbs with the potential to significantly improve upon SOC treatments for life-threatening infections. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

● | Leverage the favorable regulatory environment in infection diseases to expedite approval pathways for our product candidates. We intend to closely interact with the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and other regulatory agencies to create efficient clinical development plans and expedite approval pathways for our product candidates. For development outside of the U.S., we will evaluate potential regional collaborations which may lead to more rapid and cost-effective path to market compared to a standalone strategy. Consistent with this strategy, we completed a licensing agreement with Serum AMR Products, an affiliate of Serum International BV (SIBV) and the Serum Institute of India, Ltd. The agreement grants Serum AMR a license to multiple programs from us for certain limited territories and access our MabIgX® platform technology for asset identification and selection. As with our prior out-licensing transaction involving several of our mAb programs to Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceuticals for the China territory, this transaction allows for the introduction of innovative anti-infective therapies that are effective against antibiotic resistant infections to a broader area of the world where antimicrobial resistance is particularly high.

● | Obtain favorable regulatory designations that will fast track our product candidates. Regulatory designations can provide numerous benefits for our product candidates, including expedited development pathway and review, market exclusivity, premium pricing and faster product adoption among others. We plan to obtain QIDP, Fast-track, and Breakthrough Therapy designations for our existing and future product candidates to enhance their likelihood of approval and commercial success. To date, we have successfully received Fast Track Designation for AR-301, AR-320, and AR-105, orphan drug designation in the U.S. for AR-101 and orphan drug designation in the EU for AR-301 and AR-101. We have obtained QIDP, and Fast-track designations for AR-501. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product candidates. We aim to change the treatment paradigm of infectious disease by focusing on the pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product candidates. We utilize superiority clinical trial designs rather than non-inferiority designs typically used by antibiotics, as positive outcomes from such trials can better demonstrate efficacy and safety advantages of our product candidates. We target indications where our product candidates may address drivers of high cost of care in hospital settings, such as time on ventilator, ICU stay and hospital stay. In addition, we will continue to invest resources in market research to better identify and quantify pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implement a targeted commercialization strategy. Our core therapeutic indications can be addressed with a relatively small, specialized sales organization. As such, we may develop and operate our own dedicated sales force to directly market our products in the U.S., to hospitals. For geographies outside of the U.S., we may seek commercial partners with more regional expertise to maximize the commercial value of our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employ the advantages of our lPEX and MabIgX antibody discovery platforms as a basis to expand our product pipeline. We believe our lPEX and MabIgX platforms offer us distinct advantages over our peers in terms of new product candidate discovery and development. We can screen and identify functionally optimized B-cells from patients, and manufacture mAbs, faster than traditional technologies. Our differentiated approach reduces mAb discovery and manufacturing time compared to traditional technologies. We believe that using our technology, clinical drug supplies can be manufactured within one year from screening the patient’s blood. We intend to continue to use our platform technologies to generate new product candidates for bacterial, viral, and other infectious diseases where mAb immunotherapy has the potential to address deficiencies of current treatment alternatives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to pursue grant funding and strategic collaborations. To date, we have been awarded more than $53 million in non-dilutive grant funding. We believe that the industry’s need for novel products, such as our product candidates, makes non-dilutive funding from governmental agencies and research organizations more accessible. Furthermore, our robust pipeline of wholly-owned product candidates and highly productive discovery platform offer opportunities for value-accretive partnerships. We will continue to pursue grant funding and strategic collaborations in addition to traditional financings.

Market Opportunities
Our mission is to improve the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly the deficiencies of conventional antibiotics. It is widely recognized that there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance at a time when the pipeline of antibiotics is dwindling and much of the development activity currently ongoing is devoted to modifications of existing classes of antibiotics. We believe this antibiotic strategy has merely delayed rather than solved the underlying resistance problem as evidenced by the spread of drug resistant bacteria, particularly in the hospital settings. The drug resistance and adverse impact on the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbial flora, brought about by frequent use of broad spectrum antibiotics increased the need for targeted, narrow spectrum anti-infectives that counteract only the etiologic bacterial agent. The ability to identify the infection-causing agent has significantly improved in recent years because of the availability and proliferation of rapid diagnostic tests. These diagnostics have enabled the identification of pathogen profiles within hours of patient sample collection, thus providing physicians with the rapid, precise information necessary to make more informed treatment decisions. Given the identity of the specific pathogen responsible for an infection, we believe the physician is more likely to prescribe a targeted anti-infective, rather than a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Therefore, we believe that the treatment of infectious diseases will see a paradigm shift from broad spectrum antibiotic utilization to narrow, targeted anti-infectives. Such paradigm shift is similar to that observed in oncology starting in the early 2000s, from broad acting chemotherapies to targeted immune-oncology mAbs. Therefore, we believe that the opportunity for application of mAbs in infectious diseases is highly attractive.
The current small molecule antibiotics market is crowded, highly competitive, and lacking in product differentiation. The lack of antibiotic product differentiation is traced to the usage of non-inferiority clinical trial designs that is common practice for most of the antibiotics that have been marketed to date. No new class of antibiotic has been introduced to the market within the last two decades, which further heightens the need for new anti-infectives. In addition to significant market differentiation, mAbs may offer substantially less market competition, and higher barrier to entry. Unlike antibiotics, mAbs have a more predictable and attractive safety profile and are designed to kill via an immunological mechanism of action that is different from the mechanisms of action of all antibiotics and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, so long as it binds to such bacteria or their toxins, mAbs are likely unaffected by the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria and will remain effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria. mAbs also have a dosing frequency of once or twice a month and may require only a single administration for treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia. Our mAbs will be used as an adjunct therapy in combination with antibiotics, so they will not directly compete with antibiotics. By improving the outcome in terms of mortality and reducing the time to clinical cure and length of hospital and ICU stay, mAbs offer both a medical benefit to the patient and an economic benefit to the hospital. Our clinical study designs utilize superiority in primary end points, which will allow for clear demonstration of measurable clinical benefits and product differentiation.
We are initially focused on respiratory infections in the ICU settings, particularly bacterial pneumonia. In the U.S., there are approximately 628,000 cases of HAP and VAP (DRG 2016). HAP due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections results in substantial loss of life with an annual worldwide incidence of approximately 200,000 patients (Decision Resources, 2016 data) and mortality rates as high as 50% depending on the patient population and treatment regimen (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, Decision Resources, 2016). Mechanical Ventilation for VAP patients costs over $30 billion annually in the U.S. Infections due to MRSA represent a high-value segment of the overall antibiotics market. According to this report, the worldwide market for existing therapies for MRSA infections was over $800 million in 2015. The progressively aging population is expected to increase the number of MRSA infections that result in HAP. Moreover, MRSA infections are associated with significantly longer hospital stays, repeated hospitalizations and increased healthcare costs. Currently, the median hospital stay of a patient with VAP is 29 days, and the average length of ICU stay is 19 days. The median total hospitalization costs for a VAP patient is approximately $198,000. Current SOC antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia is dominated by five antibiotics: Linezolid, Daptomycin, Vancomycin, Ceftaroline and Tigecycline, which combined have approximately 90% market share. There is a significant need for new anti-MRSA agents given the S. aureus resistance rate of 31% to 53%. We believe that the addition of AR-301 to SOC antibiotics has the potential to improve clinical outcome and could be effective in patients with MRSA infections.

Cystic Fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection
There are more than 70,000 patients with cystic fibrosis worldwide. 80% of these patients present with chronic polymicrobial infections, particularly P. aeruginosa infection. We believe the medical need and market potential for an anti-infective therapeutic that can be given to cystic fibrosis patients chronically is substantial. The current market for inhaled antimicrobials for cystic fibrosis, based on recent combined sales figures for TOBI (tobramycin) and Cayston (aztreonam), is approximately $600 million worldwide. Existing therapies such as aminoglycoside antibiotics lead to a temporary improvement in bacterial load, but ultimately 80% to 95% of cystic fibrosis patients succumb to respiratory failure due to chronic P. aeruginosa infection and airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa is the most significant pathogen, with the majority of cystic fibrosis patients becoming chronically infected by the age of 18 years.
COVID-19 pandemic
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Worldwide as of February 2022, more than 431 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 5.93 million deaths attributed to COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threatening illness. The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other. Infection generally lasts for up to two weeks and transmission from an infected person occurs as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak. There are several highly efficacious vaccines that are marketed in different regions of the world. Regarding antiviral treatment, two monoclonal antibody-based therapies are available in the US, indicated for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe disease. The antiviral remdesivir is also available as another treatment option. However, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to limited evidence of its efficacy. Vaccination campaigns are being implemented across the world, with the expectation that it will require one to two years from now to reach the peak coverage of COVID-19 vaccination worldwide. At peak vaccination coverage, surveys have shown that at least a third of the world’s population will remain unvaccinated and an additional approximately 10% or greater of the population who are vaccinated will not be adequately protected. Because SARS-CoV-2 is expected to remain endemic for years to come, the above population remains at-risk of contracting COVID-19. Currently, approximately 80 million cases of COVID-19 infection and 950,000 deaths occurred in the U.S. The COVID vaccination coverage is approximately 65%, with only 28% of the U.S. population having received a booster shot. Given the dominance of the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants, having rendered vaccines and mAbs less effective or ineffective, and the low vaccine booster coverage, the majority of the US population remains vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is a substantial addressable patient population who will be in need of effective therapeutic intervention.
Our Product Candidates
mAbs represent a fundamentally new immunologic approach for treating bacterial infections that can potentially overcome the problems of toxicity and resistance that may occur with traditional antibiotics when they are used long-term in individual patients and pervasively across patient populations. Our product portfolio consists of candidates that have novel mechanisms of action differing from that of traditional antibiotics and includes five mAb programs, most of which were discovered using our MabIgX platform technology, and one broad spectrum small molecule anti-infective.

AR-301
Our lead product candidate, AR-301 is a fully human mAb of IgG1, for the treatment of lung infections resulting from S. aureus including MRSA strains. We are developing AR-301 as an adjunctive therapy with SOC antibiotics to treat HAP and VAP, which is in contrast to other mAb programs currently under development for prevention of HAP and VAP. AR-301 was discovered by screening the B-cell immune response repertoire generated against S. aureus infection. It has received Fast-Track designation in the U.S., Orphan status in the EU and has advanced into a Phase 3 pivotal trial.
A Phase 2a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate AR-301 plus SOC antibiotics compared to SOC antibiotics alone to treat HAP and VAP caused by S. aureus. AR-301 is targeted against S. aureus alphatoxin, which is a toxin produced by most S. aureus strains to cause destruction of human cells and tissues. In mouse models AR-301 is effective against S. aureus infections whether or not the bacteria are resistant to conventional antibiotics. We believe AR-301 has the potential to positively impact the outcome of S. aureus infections in patients by improving survival rates and/or shortening the duration of overall hospital stays, the length of time a patient requires mechanical ventilation, and/or the time a patient spends in the ICU.
We initiated the first of two Phase 3 pivotal trials in VAP patients in January 2019, which is currently ongoing. We expect to announce top line results from this trial in the second half of 2022.
Background and Mechanism of Action
AR-301 was discovered by screening B-cell lymphocytes from a patient with a confirmed S. aureus infection. AR-301 binds to alphatoxin with high affinity and prevents its assembly into an active complex, which prevents alphatoxin-mediated breakdown of cell membranes, or lysis, of erythrocytes, human lung cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes (see Figure 3 below). This prevention of killing of host cells, in turn, may protect the patient from further progression of pneumonia disease and systemic infections caused by S. aureus. During infection and active proliferation, S. aureus is metabolically more virulent, geared toward higher toxin production than during its more sessile colonization stage. In contrast to other programs targeting S. aureus colonization, AR-301 targets the active, disease causing infection stage. There is no commercially available product that specifically neutralizes the pathogenic effects brought about by S. aureus toxins. We believe that this mechanism of action complements the bacterial killing properties of many conventional antibiotics, essentially neutralizing the bacterial toxins left behind following antibiotic-mediated killing. Additional indications for AR-301 may include any S. aureus infection, particularly surgical site infections, blood stream infections, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections such as diabetic ulcers and non-healing wounds.
Figure 3
AR-301’s Mechanism of Action
Clinical Development Summary.
We completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, ascending dose Phase 2a clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and pharmacodynamics of a single intravenous administration of AR-301 plus SOC in patients with severe pneumonia caused by S. aureus (Francois, B. et al., 2018. Intensive Care Medicine journal, in-press). The 

12



SOC regimens were the physicians’ choice and were based on the individual clinical site’s prescribing practice. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients enrolled in the first cohort (1 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC), eight in the second cohort (3 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC), ten in the third cohort (10 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC) and eight in the fourth cohort (20 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC). An additional 16 patients received placebo plus SOC as an active control. This Phase 2a clinical trial included 31 sites located across Belgium, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. and was designed primarily to address the safety and pharmacokinetics of AR-301. The drug was generally well tolerated. In exploratory analysis of the VAP subgroup of 25 patients, numeric clinical improvement of antibody treated patients over placebo were observed in time to extubation. Additionally, patients treated with AR-301 exhibited trends toward a higher rate of microbiological eradication, and reduction in number of hospital or ICU days.
Phase 2a Safety and Pharmacokinetics.
Data from the Phase 2a clinical trial suggest that AR-301 was well tolerated as a treatment for severe pneumonia due to S. aureus when used as directed and in addition to antibiotics. Few (2.8%) adverse events, or AEs, and no SAEs were deemed related to AR-301 treatment. A total of 36 SAEs were observed, which are listed as follows: septic shock (3 patients or approximately 6.3% of patients), anaemia (3 patients), bacteraemia (2 patients or approximately 4.2% of patients), sepsis (2 patients), acute respiratory failure (2 patients), hypoxia (2 patients), pancreatic abscess (1 patient or approximately 2.1% of patients), pneumonia (1 patient), carbon dioxide increase (1 patient), gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (1 patient), platelet count increase (1 patient), abnormal prothrombin level (1 patient), duodenal ulcer (1 patient), epistaxis (1 patient), hypoventilation (1 patient), pleurisy (1 patient), pulmonary embolism (1 patient), haemodynamic instability (1 patient), hypotension (1 patient), shock haemorrhagic (1 patient), superior vena cava syndrome (1 patient), vena cava thrombosis (1 patient), cardiac arrest (1 patient), coronary artery stenosis (1 patient), ventricular tachycardia (1 patient), multi-organ failure (1 patient), pyrexia (1 patient), hepatic failure (1 patient), hepatocellular injury (1 patient), hypoalbuminaemia (1 patient), malnutrition (1 patient), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (1 patient), coma (1 patient), peripheral motor neuropathy (1 patient), renal failure acute (1 patient), renal failure chronic (1 patient), renal tubular necrosis (1 patient), post procedural haemorrhage (1 patient) and subdural haematoma (1 patient). Immunogenicity was observed in one subject, with no related adverse event. No significant difference in mortality was observed between groups. There were six deaths in the trial, none of which were deemed related to AR-301. Furthermore, the overall mortality observed (8.5%) in this small sample size study was very low when compared to historic published references. The pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of AR-301 is consistent with that of a human IgG1mAb, with a plasma half-life of 23 to 31 days and supports a single-dose administration for the pneumonia indication (Figure 4).
Figure 4
Pharmacokinetics Profile of AR-301
Phase 2a Clinical Efficacy.
We assessed multiple endpoints of clinical improvement including time to extubation. Time intubated to day 28 showed a decrease in the length of time patients who were treated with AR-301 plus SOC remained intubated as compared to those receiving 

13



placebo and SOC. When the subset of 25 patients with VAP was assessed, a Kaplan-Meyer analysis of time to extubation showed a separation of the group of patients treated with AR-301 plus SOC as compared to those treated with placebo plus SOC (see Figure 5). In the same subgroup of VAP patients, ventilation time was reduced numerically for patients in all four active dose groups receiving AR-301 plus SOC compared to those receiving placebo plus SOC. In an exploratory analysis, with all four treated cohorts pooled and compared versus the placebo cohort, statistical significance was achieved at p<0.01. The lack of dose response could be attributed to high variability associated with a small sample size, and/or to the high level of circulating AR-301 mAb as compared to alphatoxin load in infected patients, i.e. even at the lowest dose administered (i.e. one mg/kg) it is estimated that there is more than ten-fold mAbs than the predicted alphatoxin load.

We also determined microbiological outcomes in the overall study population. Eradication or presumed eradication (cured of pneumonia) was observed in 25 (78.1%) patients treated with AR-301 plus SOC and ten (62.5%) of 16 subjects treated with placebo plus SOC. Details of microbiological outcome by treatment cohort are provided in Figure 6a and the mean time to eradication of S. aureus bacteria also trended shorter in AR-301 treated cohorts as compared to the Placebo cohort (Figure 6b)

Summary of Microbiological Outcome by Dose Level

Mean Time to Microbiological Eradication
When clinical cure was assessed based on the sole judgment of the investigator, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups, and the overall cure rate was high compared to historic published references. Over the first 28 days of the study, the length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, both showed a modest decrease in the AR-301 plus SOC groups as compared to placebo plus SOC-treated subjects, however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.
Although SOC antibiotics were effective, the results suggest that the addition of AR-301 to SOC treatment may increase the rate of microbiological eradication, and may reduce time to eradication, time under mechanical ventilation and overall duration of hospital stay. Time ventilated in the pooled AR-301 treated cohorts (n=20) showed an exploratory p<0.01 reduction in the subset of patients with VAP as compared to the placebo plus SOC cohort (n=5). A manuscript summarizing this clinical study has been published in a peer-reviewed journal Intensive Care Medicine (Francois, B., et al.’Safety and tolerability of a single administration of AR-301, a human monoclonal antibody, in ICU patients with severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus: first-in-human trial’ Intensive Care Medicine. 44(11):1787-1796).

Planned Development Activities
We plan to conduct two pivotal clinical trials in pneumonia patients for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe. We had an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in June 2017 on the two proposed primary efficacy endpoints, ventilation time and clinical cure, for these two Phase 3 clinical trials. We also submitted a briefing document and received feedback from the EMA’s Scientific Advice experts in January 2018. We have reached concurrence with the FDA on a consolidated single primary endpoint, which may include the components of mortality, ventilation requirements and signs and symptoms of pneumonia and presented these to the EMA. Per discussions with clinical experts in the field, approximately a 15% or more improvement of AR-301 plus SOC over placebo plus SOC on these efficacy outcomes is deemed to be clinically meaningful. The first Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled active comparator AR-301 (20 mg/kg) plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC. Subject to the extent of COVID-19 related ICU utilization, we plan to enroll up to 240 VAP microbiologically evaluable patients at approximately 130 clinical sites in over 20 countries. Assuming a treatment effect of clinical cure of 85% versus 65% in active drug treated patients would provide 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant result. We also reached agreement with the FDA on the size of the safety database required for approval and we plan to include the following safety endpoints: immunogenicity, adverse events, and standard safety laboratory tests. We enrolled the first subject in the first quarter of 2019. The protracted COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause an impact on patient enrollment globally and the rate of clinical site activation, as has the 2022 war between Russia and Ukraine. Pending the COVID-19 vaccination coverage, resolution of the pandemic and Russia/Ukraine war, we provisionally expect to report top-line data in the second half of 2022.
AR-320
AR-320 or ‘suvratoxumab’ is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with an extended half-life that binds alpha-toxin (AT) with high affinity and effectively blocks AT pore formation in target cell membranes. AR-320 shares similar mechanism of action as AR-301. The nonclinical pharmacologic program for suvratoxumab includes studies evaluating the ability of suvratoxumab to bind and neutralize AT and determining the frequency of AT expression in S. aureus clinical isolates. Suvratoxumab binds AT with high affinity and effectively blocks AT pore formation in target cell membranes. The AT gene was present in 99% and expressed by 83% of approximately 1,200 clinical isolates tested. Suvratoxumab effectively neutralizes all AT sequence variants identified in these clinical isolates indicating its epitope is highly conserved. In vitro, MEDI4893 inhibits AT mediated rabbit red blood cell (RBC) and human lung epithelial, monocytic and keratinocyte cell line lysis.
Pharmacology studies were performed using the non-YTE (i.e., non half-life extended) version of suvratoxumab (known as LC10) because YTE mutations increase antibody half-life and exposure in mice, preventing the use of suvratoxumab directly in murine models. Other than the YTE modification in suvratoxumab, the sequences of suvratoxumab and LC10 are identical. 
Prophylaxis with LC10 reduced disease severity in 3 murine infection models (dermonecrosis, pneumonia, and lethal bacteraemia/sepsis) and in rabbit and ferret pneumonia models. In the lethal S. aureus pneumonia model, LC10 significantly improved survival, preserved lung integrity, and reduced both bacterial load in lungs and bacterial dissemination to the kidneys. Efficacy of LC10 was demonstrated, both for prophylaxis and adjunctive treatment utilizing the lethal S aureus murine pneumonia model, in both immunocompetent (Hua et al, 2014) and immunocompromised (Hua et al, 2015) mice. The LC10 serum EC90 in the murine pneumonia model was 211 µg/mL, and this value was set as the clinical target level for suvratoxumab in patients. LC10 also reduced lesion size and improved survival in the murine dermonecrosis and lethal bacteraemia/sepsis models.
The nonclinical safety evaluation program for suvratoxumab included a tissue cross-reactivity study and a single-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. As predicted for a bacterial target, no specific staining with suvratoxumab was observed using a full panel of normal human tissues in the cross-reactivity study, indicating an absence of cross-reactivity of suvratoxumab with the tested human tissues. Following a single IV infusion, suvratoxumab was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at dosages exceeding the expected human therapeutic dosage. No mortality was observed in the study and during the 12-week observation period there were no adverse suvratoxumab related findings. 
Toxicokinetic (TK) analyses confirmed all monkeys were exposed to suvratoxumab and revealed the expected extended half-life of this molecule. An ex vivo AT-neutralization assay demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity of suvratoxumab in serum samples from monkeys administered suvratoxumab confirming that pharmacologically active concentrations of suvratoxumab were attained. As suvratoxumab is a mAb that binds to a bacterial target not expressed in healthy humans or healthy animals, no additional toxicology studies (including reproductive toxicity studies) are planned for suvratoxumab in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) S6(R1) guidance for Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals.

Clinical Development
The clinical development of suvratoxumab is aimed to support the target indication of prevention of nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus is a pre-emptive approach, evaluating the effects of suvratoxumab in hospitalized patients with confirmed S. aureus colonisation of the lower respiratory tract.
Suvratoxumab has been evaluated in two clinical studies, including a Phase 1 study in healthy adult volunteers and a Phase 2 study in mechanically ventilated patients at high risk for S. aureus infections. A single Phase 3 study is being proposed to support the Marketing Authorization of suvratoxumab.
Study CD-ID-MEDI4893-1133 was a Phase 1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of suvratoxumab, administered as a single IV dose of 225, 750, 2250, or 5000 mg, compared to placebo in 33 healthy adult volunteers. Suvratoxumab exhibited linear and dose proportional serum pharmacokinetics (PK), with a half-life (t1/2) of 80-112 days, and no major safety findings were observed. PK analyses and simulations from this study served as the basis for advancing 2 dosages (2000 mg and 5000 mg) into Study CD-ID-MEDI4893-1139. The 2000 mg dose was selected as the likely efficacious dose because it was the lowest dose expected to maintain a serum AR-320 exposure above 211 μg/mL for 30 days. The 5000 mg suvratoxumab dose was selected to explore maximal efficacy in patients, and to ensure appropriate drug exposure in case there was significantly greater drug clearance in the mechanically ventilated ICU patients compared with the healthy volunteers, which would lead to the 2000 mg dose providing suboptimal exposure.
Study CD-ID-MEDI4893-1139 was a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, superiority design study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 2 dosages of suvratoxumab in mechanically ventilated subjects (Francois et al, 2021). These patients were in the ICU and deemed at high risk for S. aureus infections and were currently free of S. aureus-related disease but who were colonised with S. aureus in the lower respiratory tract.
Study enrollment was completed on April 1, 2018, when 767 patients were screened, of whom 213 patients with confirmed S. aureus colonisation of the lower respiratory tract were randomly assigned to the suvratoxumab 2000 mg group (n=15), the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group (n=96), or the placebo group (n=102). The 2000 mg group was discontinued per recommendation from the trial’s data monitoring committee. At 30 days after treatment, 17 (18%) of 96 patients in the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group and 26 (26%) of 100 patients in the placebo group had developed S. aureus pneumonia (relative risk reduction 31·9% [90% CI −7·5 to 56·8], p=0·17), as determined by an independent endpoint adjudication committee (Table 1). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events at 30 days were similar between the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group (87 [91%]) and the placebo group (90 [90%]). The incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events at 30 days were also similar between the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group (36 [38%]) and the placebo group (32 [32%]). No significant difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events between the two groups at 90 days (89 [93%] in the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group vs 92 [92%] in the placebo group) and at 190 days (93 [94%] vs 93 [93%]) was observed. Forty (40%) patients in the placebo group and 50 (52%) in the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group had a serious adverse event at 190 days. In the suvratoxumab 5000 mg group, one (1%) patient reported at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event deemed related to treatment, two (2%) patients reported an adverse event of special interest, and two (2%) reported a new-onset chronic disease.
Pre-specified analyses (Table 1) were performed for EAC-determined S. aureus pneumonia (primary efficacy endpoint), as well as for the exploratory efficacy endpoints of EAC-determined all-cause pneumonia, and EAC-determined all-cause pneumonia or death.

Two prespecified analyses that were conducted were 1) a subgroup of subjects who are less than or equal to 65 years old and 2) impact on the 5 VAP bundles, which is a clinical outcome improvement assessment (i.e., elevation of the head of the bed, daily sedation vacation and readiness to extubate assessment, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, daily oral care with chlorhexidine). Aging is associated with immunosenescence, progressively reduced innate and adaptive immune response against infections, and a concomitant increased frequency of age-related diseases, inflammatory status and comorbidities such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases (Crooke et al, 2019; Barbe-Tuana et al, 2020). As an anti-exotoxin, suvratoxumab does not directly mediate bacterial killing, rather, a competent host immune response is required for bacterial killing. Older patients, such as those > 65 years of age, may not have sufficient immune competency to eradicate the bacterial cells, and may derive less clinical benefits from AR-320 treatment. In the Phase 2 study, 83% of subjects >65 years of age had at least 1 comorbidity compared to 64% of subjects ≤ 65 years of age (including congestive heart failure, COPD, cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, renal insufficiency, etc). Hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity, and was higher among >65 years of age (63%) vs those ≤ 65 years of age (44%). A ≤ 65 years old subgroup analysis was prespecified in a Phase 2 study. Results of the prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint are shown in Figure 1. Compared with placebo, suvratoxumab treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of S. aureus pneumonia in subjects ≤ 65 years of age (relative risk reduction [RRR] = 47·4%, 90%CI, 3·5% to 71·4%, P=0.075; Table 2) and in subjects who received all 5 VAP bundles during the course of MV, statistical significant relative risk reduction was achieved (RRR = 46·3%, 90%CI, 2.2% to 70.5%, P=0.075). Post hoc analysis also demonstrated a reduction of S. aureus pneumonia in suvratoxumab-treated subjects with a low S. aureus LRT colonisation load (RRR = 66·7%, 90%CI, 21·3% to 86·2%, P=0.069) (Figure 1).


Figure 1. Results of Pre-Specified Subgroup Analyses
Note: Overall RRRs and 90% CI were calculated with Poisson regression with robust variance. Subgroup analyses were prespecified. Subgroup RRRs and 90% Cis were based on the unconditional CI on the ratio of proportions. Abx= antibiotics; CT= cycle threshold; RRR= relative risk reduction; VAP= ventilator-associated pneumonia. Subgroup analysis of S. aureus colonisation load was done as a post-hoc analysis. Preventive VAP measures (bundles) were elevation of the head of the bed, daily sedation vacations and extubation readiness assessment, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and daily oral care with chlorhexidine.
Efficacy analyses of the prespecified subgroup of subjects ≤ 65 years of age provided consistent magnitude of absolute risk reduction across the primary and key exploratory endpoints of EAC-determined S. aureus pneumonia (primary efficacy endpoint), as

The duration of healthcare resource utilization analyses (Table 3 and Table 4) suggested trends in reduction of HRU in the mITT, those ≤ 65 years old. In addition, the duration of HRU were also shorter in HRU duration among subjects who developed EAC S. aureus pneumonia.

In patients in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with PCR-confirmed S. aureus colonisation of the lower respiratory tract, the incidence of S. aureus pneumonia at 30 days following treatment with 5000 mg suvratoxumab than with placebo. These results support that mAbs represent a promising therapeutic option to reduce antibiotic consumption that require further exploration and studies.
Planned Development Activities
An IND amendment is planned for the second quarter of 2022 to include the final Phase 3 protocol (AR-320-003), in addition to an updated Module 3 for the description of the drug substance and drug product lots produced at a new manufacturing facility, using the same Phase 1-2 Master Cell Bank, and same Phase 1-2 DP formulation. 
Study AR-301-003 will be a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of suvratoxumab in mechanically ventilated adults (≤ 65 years old) and adolescents for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus. Approximately 420 subjects will be enrolled at 200 centres worldwide. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (210:210) to receive a single IV dose of suvratoxumab (5000 mg) or placebo. Randomisation will be stratified by age group (adults vs. adolescents), country, by whether or not subjects received systemic anti-S. aureus systemic antibiotic treatment, and by whether the subject has underlying COVID-19 infection. Following investigational product administration on Day 1, subjects will be followed through Day 91. A schematic representation of the study design is presented in Figure 2.



Figure 2. Study Flow Diagram and Additional Design Details

The primary endpoint for this study is the incidence of S. aureus pneumonia through 30 days after a single dose of suvratoxumab in mechanically ventilated subjects at risk for S. aureus pneumonia. It is anticipated that while a substantial number of mechanically ventilated subjects will continue to require mechanical ventilation throughout the 30-day post-dose period, a number of subjects will be weaned off the ventilator during this period. 
Assuming successful outcomes from the proposed Phase 3 study and agency agreement to the development strategy, it is the intent that a Biologics License Application (BLA) will be submitted at the end of the clinical trial
AR-101
AR-101 is a human IgM mAb that we are developing to treat P. aeruginosa, the leading cause of hospital acquired lung infections. AR-101, which we are initially developing as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of HAP and VAP caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11, binds to the lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, on the cell surface of P. aeruginosa. Serotype O11 is one of the most prevalent P. aeruginosa serotypes in HAP and VAP, representing approximately 23% of cases (Lu et al 2014). It is estimated that the addressable patient population in the U.S., EU and Japan combined is approximately 95,600 patients. AR-101 has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and in the EU. We intend to incorporate a companion diagnostic test based on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, technology that can rapidly identify P. aeruginosa serotype O11 strains in order to identify those patients most likely to respond to AR-101. We have completed a Phase 1 safety and tolerability trial of single ascending doses of AR-101 in healthy adults and an open-label Phase 2a safety and pharmacokinetics trial of up to three single doses of AR-101 in pneumonia patients. These studies suggested AR-101 to be generally well tolerated in both healthy adults and HAP and VAP patients. Comparison of the per protocol population (n=13) of the Phase 2a study, which excluded four patients from the ITT population (n=17) because they did not complete the treatment regimen, and a contemporaneous control cohort suggested that AR-101 therapy may improve survival, cure rate of the index pneumonia, and time to cure pneumonia.
Figure 7
AR-101 Mechanism of Action

21



Background and Mechanism of Action
Upon binding, AR-101 mediates the deposition of the human complement to the surface of P. aeruginosa bacteria. This antibody-complement complex leads to improved recognition by the host immune cells, which results in engulfment and killing of the bacteria (Figure 7). AR-101, like IgM antibodies in general, provides several advantages towards more effective bacterial killing. They possess ten binding sites rather than two for IgG, and they are 100 to 1,000 times more effective than IgG at binding and/or activating key enzymes that facilitate the killing of P. aeruginosa. As a result, IgM antibodies are becoming more prevalent as candidates for drug therapies.
Clinical Development Summary
We have completed two clinical studies of AR-101 to date. We completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AR-101. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 32 volunteers in four antibody treatment cohorts at doses of 0.1, 0.4, 1.2 and 4.0 mg/kg as well as placebo cohort. No SAEs were observed, and no subject was discontinued due to an AE. Reported AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and all resolved without sequelae, and the incidence of AEs did not increase with the dose. There was no activation of an immune response against AR-101. Pharmacokinetic characteristics that were observed were consistent with the characteristics of a human IgM, with a serum half-life between 70 and 95 hours.
Subsequently, we completed an open-label Phase 2a study in 18 subjects, which was the first study performed in the target indication of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11. Treatment consisted of three intravenous infusions of 1.2 mg/kg of AR-101 given over two hours on days one, four and seven for a total dose of 3.6 mg/kg. The 30-day survival rates were 82% in the intent-to-treat (ITT; 17 subjects) and 100% in the per protocol (13 subjects) populations, respectively. Clinical resolution of pneumonia was observed in 76% of patients in the ITT population and 100% of patients in the per protocol population. Microbiological resolution was observed in six subjects, representing 35% of the ITT population and 31% of the per protocol population. The time to resolution of pneumonia was 14 days and nine days in the ITT and per protocol populations, respectively. The time to extubation or cessation of ICU management was 22 days in the ITT and 13 days in the per protocol populations, respectively. Measurements of clinical status improved promptly in parallel with clinical resolution of disease.
14 SAEs were experienced by six of the subjects. The types of SAEs were: gastrointestinal bleeding (3 patients or approximately 21% of patients), cardiac and respiratory arrest (2 patients or approximately 14% of patients), multi-organ failure (2 patients), hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis (1 patient or approximately 7% of patients), neutropenia (1 patient), low count of platelets (1 patient), activated partial thromboplastin time (1 patient), prolongation (1 patient), septic shock (1 patient); cholestasis (1 patient) and troponin increase (due to cardiac arrest) (1 patient). An event of cardiorespiratory arrest was judged as probably related to AR-101 and events of hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis, although pre-existent, were deemed possibly related. In both cases, the investigators assessed that a contribution by AR-101 to the adverse event could not be excluded with certainty but acknowledged other probable causes were acknowledged. The other SAEs were deemed unrelated.
In parallel, we also conducted a contemporaneous cohort study of the incidence and outcome of HAP and VAP caused by various P. aeruginosa serotypes in critically ill patients. The data were extracted from the medical files of the patients selected according to eligibility criteria similar to those of our Phase 2a study. Cohort patients infected with P. aeruginosa serotype O11 (14 patients in total) had a lower survival rate, cure rate, and microbiological resolution rate, as well as longer mean times on ventilator and in the ICU as compared to patients in our Phase 2a clinical trial who received a complete treatment of three 1.2 mg/kg doses of AR-101. A summary of the results of the Phase 2a study and the contemporaneous cohort study is shown in Figure 8 below.

Preclinical Summary
AR-101 reacts with a wide range of P. aeruginosa serotype O11 clinical isolates from different hospitals, indicating broad application against infections with this serotype. AR-101 is also capable of stimulating phagocytic immune cells to ingest P. aeruginosa bacterial cells in a dose dependent manner, thereby killing the pathogen. Passive immunization with murine mAb recognizing O-polysaccharides in LPS of P. aeruginosa conferred protection against lethal challenge with live pseudomonas bacteria in several animal models of pneumonia infections. In preclinical studies, AR-101 was found to demonstrate attenuating protection against pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11 and exhibited a complementary effect with meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Additionally, we had the following observations in preclinical studies of AR-101. AR-101 protected mice in a dose-dependent manner from P. aeruginosa infection after a burn-wound challenge. Doses of five μg/mouse (corresponding to about 0.2 mg/kg body weight) conferred 70% to 100% protection from systemic P. aeruginosa challenge. Administration of decreasing doses resulted in lower survival rates and administration of AR-101 led to rapid clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lung in mice and was associated with milder lung pathology six and 24 hours after infection. In addition, AR-101-treated animals had a significantly lower systemic P. aeruginosa bacterial load compared to control animals that received saline. To mimic the adjunctive use of AR-101 in humans, AR-101 was administered in combination with meropenem (used clinically to treat pseudomonal infections) in a modified lung challenge model. When meropenem and AR-101 were administered in combination, significant reductions in lung weight (a surrogate marker for injection-induced inflammation), bacterial load and lung inflammation were observed in infected mice compared to each agent given alone.
AR-501
To complement our suite of targeted antibody product candidates, we are developing AR-501 (gallium(III) citrate) as an anti-infective therapy to manage both chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. AR-501 exhibits broad antimicrobial activity against antibiotic resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in free-living, or planktonic, and biofilm communities, as well as against non-tuberculosis mycobacteria and fungi. We believe AR-501’s unique combination of broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against pathogens, lower propensity to develop resistance than inhaled TOBI (tobramycin) and Cayston (aztreonam), and less frequent dosing as compared to SOC, make it an ideal candidate for treatment of chronic polymicrobial infections, such as lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. AR-501 has been granted Fast-Track and QIDP designations by the FDA.
To enhance delivery to the lungs and provide a simple method of administration, we are developing AR-501 as an inhaled formulation that can be administered conveniently with one of several commercially available liquid nebulization devices. We were awarded a development grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for up to approximately $7.5 million to develop an aerosolized formulation of AR-501 to manage bacterial lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. We have produced, good manufacturing practice, or GMP, clinical bulk drug that is ready for use in human clinical trials, and we have completed good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology studies. We believe that the novel characteristics of AR-501, namely broad spectrum activity, lower propensity to develop resistance, and long half-life, may enable cystic fibrosis patients to avoid the current need for the intermittent “drug holidays” commonly employed with SOC drugs such as TOBI (tobramycin). The novel characteristics of AR-501 may also benefit patients with other infectious lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia.

23



Background and Mechanism of Action
AR-501 is a proprietary formulation of gallium(III) citrate. Trivalent ions of the element gallium (Ga) have biologic activity because Ga(III) chemically mimics the ferric iron ions (Fe(III)) that bacteria and many other microorganisms require for survival. Bacterial iron-binding proteins imperfectly distinguish Ga(III) from Fe(III), functionally starving bacteria of iron and poisoning critical Fe(III)-dependent metabolic pathways. We believe this novel mechanism of action is distinct from those underlying all current antibiotics.
There is a long history of administering gallium(III) salts to humans. Gallium scans are used as diagnostic tests to identify areas of inflammation, infection, or cancer in the body, and Ganite, a formulation of gallium(III) nitrate, was introduced in 2003 as an FDA-approved intravenous treatment for hypercalcemia secondary to cancer. The anti-infective activity was only recently demonstrated using gallium(III) nitrate in citrate buffer. Our in vitro tests and in vivo animal studies show that gallium(III) citrate exhibits the same antimicrobial activity as gallium(III) nitrate in citrate buffer, demonstrating that Ga(III) ion itself, and not any particular salt form, is responsible for the anti-infective activity.
Clinical Data Summary
More than 50 published human clinical trials conducted in more than 1,000 cancer patients attest to the safety of systemic Ga(III) compounds and establish a tolerated dose that greatly exceeds the dose at which we project AR-501 will be used. Recently an open-label Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of Ganite administered intravenously to cystic fibrosis patients showed evidence of an improvement in lung function and reduction of P. aeruginosa burden in the lungs. Investigators at the University of Washington, or UW, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation conducted the clinical study, and we analyzed patient samples to determine pharmacokinetics. The aim of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, lung distribution, and safety of intravenous Ga(III) in cystic fibrosis patients. This non-randomized Phase 1 study comprised two dosing cohorts (cohort one: n=9 patients, cohort two: n=11 patients). Analysis of subjects’ sputum, urine, and plasma showed persistent Ga(III) levels in sputum up to 28 days after a single dose. Encouragingly, a number of patients in both cohorts showed significant reduction in sputum P. aeruginosa and an improvement in steady forced expiratory volume (FEV1) throughout the 28 days. We anticipate that inhaled AR-501 can result in at least 100-fold higher Ga(III) concentration in the lungs. The UW investigators continue to develop Ganite as an intravenous treatment for cystic fibrosis associated lung infections and initiated a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 clinical study in cystic fibrosis patients. This study was completed in the second half of 2018 and provided clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of Ga(III) in cystic fibrosis patients (see Goss, C. et al. The Ignite Study: IV Gallium Nitrate As A Treatment For Chronic Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection In CF. North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Abstract number 307, 2018).
Preclinical Data Summary
AR-501 exhibits antimicrobial activity in diverse in vitro and in vivo bacterial infection models. The in vitro activity of Ga(III) salts extends to many gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria, non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, fungi and in vivo activity has been demonstrated against P. aeruginosa when administered via inhalation and intraperitoneal injection. We showed that persistent exposure of P. aeruginosa to gallium(III) citrate did not change the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, whereas parallel studies demonstrated a greater than eight-fold rise in MIC for the antibiotics tobramycin, vancomycin, or aztreonam. Thus, we believe that for mechanistic reasons, bacteria are less likely to develop resistance to Ga(III) compounds than to conventional antibiotics. Pharmacokinetic studies of inhaled AR-501 in mice showed the initial half-life was 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life was 40.0 hours. In preclinical animal lung infection studies, AR-501 at an inhaled dose as low as 3.7 mg/kg is protective against a lethal challenge with P. aeruginosa strain PA103.
We tested the local effects of inhaled Ga(III) on lung tissues by examining the acute pulmonary toxicity of inhaled gallium(III) nitrate formulated in a citrate buffer in mice. We exposed animals to aerosolized gallium(III) nitrate formulated in a citrate buffer (12.5 mg/mL) for two, four, or six hours in a whole body exposure chamber. Histopathological evaluation revealed no significant changes in lung tissues. Inflammation was observed that reached a maximum at four to eight hours post dosing but waned beyond eight hours. Mice and subsequently dogs that were administered AR-501 by inhalation once per week for 28 days (five administrations), showed unremarkable clinical chemistry findings, and no significant adverse observations were noted in the lungs or kidneys. The no observed adverse effect level from the GLP toxicology testing has been established.

Planned Development Activities
The Phase 1 portion of the clinical study in healthy adults has been completed and results were reported in 2020. The Phase 2a clinical study is initiated. Pending the resolution of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, we provisionally expect to complete enrollment in the second half or 2021 and top-line data shortly afterwards.
AR-701
With the substantial number of people unvaccinated and immunocompromised world-wide, and the emergence of new variants that can evade immune protection, a great need remains for new therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 that are unlikely to be impacted by its continued evolution. Furthermore, there is a potential treatment advantage of combining Abs that simultaneously inhibit multiple viral functions. AR-701 is a cocktail of two fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) lambda mAbs AR-720 and AR-703 that inhibits both ACE2 binding and viral fusion. The cocktail directed at the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-protein) receptor binding domain (RBD) and the stem ‘S2’ region, respectively. AR-701 was identified by screening the blood of COVID-19 convalescent patients. Antibodies directed to the S-protein RBD are generally thought to be required for blockage of viral binding and host cell entry via the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and thus viral neutralizing. RBD is used predominantly as the target in clinical stage vaccines and antibody candidates, with positive clinical responses, with two mAbs receiving Emergency Use Authorization (EAU) from the FDA. AR-703 recognizes all human β-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 Wa-1, Beta, and Omicron. AR-703 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2/Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with AR-720, an S1-specific neutralizing mAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of AR-703 i.n. 20 hours following infection with SARS-CoV/Urbani protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden. These results indicate co-operativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing mAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential may be induced in humans and may inform universal coronavirus vaccine development. AR-701 showed broad binding to SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, including recently reported variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as the variants associated with the UK, South Africa, Brazil and Japan SARS-CoV-2, Delta, and Omicron. AR-701 also binds and neutralized SARS and MERS coronaviruses, which were viruses that caused prior pandemic in China and the Middle East, respectively.
Different from other mAb therapies that are under clinical testing, AR-701 is intended to be delivered via inhalation. COVID-19 mAb has been shown to mediate therapeutic treatment benefits and eradication of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals at a lung deposited dose level that is more than 100-fold lower than the dose required to achieve similar levels of efficacy when delivered by the parenteral route of administration (Piepenbrink, et al., Cell Reports Medicine doi: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100218). AR-701 has shown evidence of treatment benefit as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, equivalent to 0.01mg/kg of lung deposited dose (Figure 9).

25



Figure 9

There are two key advantages of inhalation delivery of a mAb over standard IV administration. The first is dosing efficiency and dose sparing as compared to the parenteral routes of administration. With an efficient nebulization device, up to half the dose or more can be deposited in the lungs, which is the target organ. In contrast, a recent clinical study showed that when a 1800 mg mAb dose is delivered by IV, the estimated peak concentration of drug reached in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in the lungs (Cmax) was only 128 µg/mL (Magyarics, et al, 2019), which represents less than 0.2% of the drug administered (Fröhlich, et al, 2016). The benefit of significant dose sparing provided by inhalation administration will alleviate supply constraints for the drug, allowing the treatment of significantly more patients from each mAb production batch and thereby expanding the number of patients that can receive the drug. The second key advantage of inhalation delivery over parenteral delivery is convenience. Administration by inhalation does not require a hospital or clinic, and, as with many other inhaled treatments such as those for cystic fibrosis or asthma, can be performed by the patient themselves in their own home. The convenience of self-administration in an outpatient setting is designed to lower the barrier to COVID-19 treatment. This can also reduce the burden on hospital resources, reducing exposure risks to health care workers. These advantages, combined with increased supply, enables a uniquely positioned mAb treatment in much broader patient settings.
AR-401
AR-401 is our mAb discovery program aimed at treating infections caused by A. baumannii, which is a gram-negative pathogen that is rapidly emerging as a serious threat to patients in hospital care. Its high level of resistance to first-line antibiotic therapies, potential to survive prolonged periods on dry surfaces and ability to form biofilms rapidly on artificial devices, such as catheters and ventilators, have made it particularly virulent. The clinical impact of A. baumannii infections can have serious adverse consequences with crude mortality rates reaching 30% in infected ICU patients. Moreover, infection with A. baumannii leads to an increased length of stay at the ICU of an average of 15 extra days. We intend to develop an anti-A. baumannii human mAb to address the unmet medical need for new and effective anti-infectives to treat severe and life-threatening infections caused by this difficult-to-treat bacterium.
We have made significant progress toward the identification of potential anti-microbial targets on A. baumannii, which we believe will facilitate the development of both active and passive immune-based therapies. We believe our preliminary target identification work on A. baumannii is among the most comprehensive to date. We used a proteomic approach to identify bacterial surface proteins that are accessible to the immune system. We then performed a thorough analysis using multiple bioinformatic tools that reduced the number of identified proteins to eight outer membrane proteins on A. baumannii. Our studies showed that active immunization with each protein reduced mortality in a pneumonia model. Antibodies against these A. baumannii targets were also 

26



detected in the majority of A. baumannii infected patient sera. Polyclonal rabbit immune sera raised against these targets mediated protection in the Acinetobacter pneumonia mouse model as shown by a reduction of mortality and clinical score.
Of the eight surface proteins identified as potential targets for mAbs, three have been previously characterized. The five remaining proteins are of unknown function, potentially representing completely unique and innovative targets. Antibody titers to all eight proteins can be detected in sera of convalescent patients whereas sera from healthy donors from a regional blood bank have only very low or undetectable antibody serum titers to these proteins. An initial study demonstrated that the peripheral blood lymphocytes, or PBL, from patients with a high serum titer can result in hybridoma cell lines that specifically stain A. baumannii cells. Our planned next step for this program is to select a lead therapeutic mAb and advance into in vitro potency testing and in vivo assessment of therapeutic efficacy in an A. baumannii challenge mouse model.
Our MAbIgX® and lPEXTM Fully Human Antibody Discovery Platform
Our proprietary MabIgX and lPEX discovery platforms enable us to rapidly screen, identify and optimize fully human therapeutic mAb product candidates directly from the B-cells of patients. We have developed a method of selecting rare, potent B-cells isolated either from convalescent individuals who have successfully survived an infection with the pathogen or healthy individuals who have been actively immunized with a vaccine against a target pathogen. These B-cells produce antibodies that are highly relevant for the body’s defense against a particular pathogen and which we believe will be highly protective mAb therapeutic product candidates. Our mAb product candidates are of completely human origin, which we believe maximizes the antibodies’ protection and effector functions and minimizes the risk of adverse reactions.
We believe our MabIgX and lPEX drug discovery platforms, which enable us to rapidly identify and manufacture naturally occurring fully human antibody product candidates, provides us with the following competitive advantages:

● | ability to rapidly screen for rare and potent B-cells to produce differentiated mAb product candidates and expeditiously progress product candidates from target identification to clinical development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | broad applicability to produce immunologically and clinically relevant product candidates across all relevant immunoglobulin isotypes, including IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | discovery of mAb product candidates with high efficacy due to recognition of epitopes relevant for humans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generation of mAb product candidates that are well tolerated and that have the potential for multiple administrations due to low immunogenicity, or nominal ability to provoke an anti-drug immune response; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to rapidly progress to clinical manufacturing by avoiding the need for time consuming recombinant antibody engineering processes and production cell lines.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our technology enables us to overcome one of the major challenges in developing human therapeutic mAbs, which is the inability to easily select and culture antigen-induced mAb-producing human B-cells and to use them to construct continuous mAb-producing cell lines. We have defined the properties of circulating antigen-specific human B-cells recruited through the immune response to polysaccharide and protein antigens, and have optimized their enrichment and propagation in culture for the production of fully human mAbs. After isolation, these highly antigen-specific human B-cells are for large scale manufacturing of our fully human mAbs.
Our technology enables us to isolate and select the most relevant and most effective human antibodies for a specific pathogen. Not all pathogens require the same type of immune effector function, and therefore, our immune system has developed a set of different antibody isotypes with very specific characteristics. For example, high-affinity IgG antibodies are more efficient at neutralizing viruses and preventing infections whereas IgM antibodies can more efficiently attack gram-negative bacteria by targeting the bacterial surface polysaccharides and by activating complement, which leads to a “flagging” of the bacteria, known as opsonization, and ultimately the destruction of the bacteria by the immune system. It is important to isolate antibodies of the proper isotype based on the infection targeted and the desired reaction of the human immune system. Our MabIgX technology enables the isolation of the isotype of an antibody that the human immune system utilizes to combat a particular pathogen and isolate all different isotypes.

27



Our lPEXTM platform technology is also designed to discover new monoclonal antibody products directly from patients but extends beyond MabIgX’s utility in its B-cell screening capacity, with its ability to increase mAb productivity from existing mammalian production cell lines, and the involvement of a novel CHO based production cell line technology that differs from MabIgX’s usage of hybridoma cell line. APEX allows for the unbiased discovery of new and highly potent antibodies against pathogens and a methodology to maximize the production/yield of selected antibodies on commercial scale. The platform technology is comprised of a silicon wafer-based array of nanoliter sized tissue microculture wells that enable rapid screening of antibody secreting cells, enabling discovery of potent antibodies against targets such as viruses within one day of a pandemic outbreak. It also features CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) gene editing enabled activation of endogenous genetic control elements that dramatically increase the yield of biotherapeutic drugs from manufacturing production cell lines, and a proprietary production cell line that is designed to rapidly manufacture multiple monoclonal antibody therapeutics at approximately half the manufacturing cycle time than current available manufacturing technologies. We have licensed the CRISPR gene editing technology from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
lPEXTM is expected to facilitate the rapid discovery and production of critical therapies for companies operating in the biopharmaceutical, biomanufacturing and biosimilar space. A summary of the lPEX technology suite is shown in Figure 10.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents and other proprietary protections of our commercially important technologies and product candidates, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to maintain trade secrets or other proprietary know-how, both in the U.S. and other countries. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that protect these activities. We seek to protect proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent estate includes approximately 161 issued patents (approximately 32 of which are in the U.S.) and approximately 53 pending patent applications (approximately 8 of which are in the U.S.), which we either own or for which we have an exclusive commercial license (either in its entirety or within our field of use), as is more fully described below.

The U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2034 and—in case of grant-currently pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2035, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.

29



Complementing the product specific patents is a pharmaceutical processing and formulation technology related portfolio comprising five patent families of which one was in-licensed. The patent families consist of nine national patents and patent applications on formulation and delivery technologies. The issued patents have expected expiration ranges between 2022 and 2030, and the pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2022 and 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Claims in the patents are directed to formulation, stabilization, and delivery of pharmaceuticals.
We are also actively pursuing additional patent applications in the U.S. and foreign patent jurisdictions for other preclinical product candidates and methods of use, including additional product candidates for infectious disease. In addition, we will pursue patent protection whenever it is deemed sufficiently beneficial for any product or product candidate and related technology we develop and/or acquire in the future.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether the product candidates we are developing will gain patent protection or, if patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented, invalidated, or found to be unenforceable. Because patent applications in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions or filing dates covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant proceedings, interference proceedings, or third-party ex parte or inter partes reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, any of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. To the extent it is prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. Some of our patents currently benefit from patent term adjustment and some of our patents that will be issued in the future may benefit from patent term adjustment.
The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved product may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the product is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent-term extensions on patents covering those products.
To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and there can be no assurance that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third-parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products.

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be and are our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Agreement
In December 2016, pursuant to a letter agreement between us and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, we received an award for up to $2.9 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to advance research on potential drugs utilizing inhaled gallium citrate anti infective. On November 26, 2018, pursuant to an amendment to the letter agreement, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation increased the potential award to up to approximately $7.5 million. Under the award agreement, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will make payments to us as certain milestones are met. The award agreement also contains a provision whereby if we spend less on developing a potential drug utilizing inhaled gallium citrate anti infective than we actually receive under this award agreement, we will be required to return the excess portion of the award to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. No liability related to this excess amount was recorded by us as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
In the event that development efforts are successful and we commercialized a drug from these related development efforts, we may be subject to pay to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation a one-time amount equal to nine times the awarded amount. Such amount shall be paid in not more than five annual installments.
In the event that we license rights to the product in the field to a third-party, sell the product, or consummate a change of control transaction prior to the first commercial sale, we shall pay to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the amounts received by us and its shareholders in connection with such disposition up to nine times the actual awarded amount received from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
In the event that the development efforts are delayed, which result from events within our control, for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days at any time before we first commercialize the drug from the related development efforts, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation may provide an interruption notice to us. We then have thirty (30) days to respond to such notice. If we do not respond within thirty (30) days, an interruption license shall be effective. The interruption license to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is an exclusive, worldwide license under the development program technology to manufacture, have manufactured, license, use, sell, offer to sell, and support the product in the field and includes financial conditions for both parties.
None of these events have occurred as of December 31, 2021.

Corporate Licensing Arrangements 
MedImmune Limited – License Agreement
In July 2021, the Company executed a license agreement effective July 12, 2021 and entered into an amendment to the license agreement on August 9, 2021 (collectively the “MedImmune License Agreement”) with MedImmune Limited (“MedImmune”), pursuant to which MedImmune granted the Company an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of suvratoxumab, a Phase 3 ready fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin (the “Licensed Product”). As consideration for the MedImmune License Agreement, the Company issued 884,956 shares of its common stock to MedImmune and a $5.0 million cash payment is due to MedImmune upon the earlier of (i) a registered direct offering in which the Company receives third-party funding or (ii) December 31, 2021. The $5.0 million liability is unpaid as of December 31, 2021, but is expected to be made in 2022 pending resolution of certain documentary matters. It therefore has been included in accrued liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021, and recorded as research and development expense within its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value of the 884,956 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the MedImmune License agreement is approximately $6.5 million (see Note 9) which the Company recognized as research and development expense within its consolidated statement of operations and additional paid-in capital within equity in its consolidated balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2021.
As additional consideration, the Company will pay MedImmune milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals, for one licensed product, up to a total aggregate amount of $30.0 million and sales related milestone payments of up to $85.0 million. There are no development milestone payments. MedImmune is entitled to royalty payments based on aggregate net sales ranging from 12.5% to 15% dependent on net sales volume. Further, until delivery of an interim data readout, or an interim futility analysis, from the first Phase 3 clinical study for any indication, MedImmune has a right of first negotiation regarding any commercial rights that the Company intends to sub-license. The term of the MedImmune License Agreement continues until the expiration of the last royalty term for the last licensed product as defined in the license agreement.
Serum Institute of India (via Serum AMR Products)
In July 2019, we entered into an Option Agreement for Exclusive Product and Platform Technology License (the Option Agreement) with Serum International BV, a company incorporated in the Netherlands (SIBV). Pursuant to the Option Agreement, SIBV made a fee payment to us in the amount of $5 million.
In September 2019, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (the License Agreement) with Serum AMR Products, a Netherlands based company (SAMR), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIBV, pursuant to the previous Option Agreement, and received an upfront cash payment of $10 million (in addition to the $5 million that was initially received upon the parties entering into the Option Agreement).
Pursuant to the License Agreement we granted to SAMR the following:

a. | Limited Territory Intellectual Property (IP) Licenses – exclusive licenses to develop, distribute, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize our products related to AR-301, AR-105, and AR-101 (Aridis Products) in (a) the country of India, and (b) all other countries of the world except the USA, Canada, EU Territory, UK, China, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, New Zealand, and Japan (the Limited Territory) for the term of the License Agreement. For our products AR-105 and AR-101, the countries do not exclude South Korea and Brazil. These licenses do not include the right to label, package, manufacture or have manufactured the products; however, we granted to SAMR a separate option for manufacturing rights related to these products, as discussed below.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35




b. | Worldwide Territory IP License – an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, make, have made, distribute, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize the AR-201 product in all countries of the world except China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (the Worldwide Territory) during the term of the License Agreement.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Research & Development Option – the right for us to provide research services for the identification of up to five (5) candidates for SAMR Products including candidate development and an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, make, have made, distribute, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize these development products in the Worldwide Territory, during the term of the License Agreement. The five candidates to be identified and the development plans related to this option were to be agreed upon within 12 months of the License Agreement.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | Manufacturing Rights Option – the initial license granted above for the Limited License Products does not allow for manufacturing. This option provides incremental rights related to the Limited License Products beyond what is granted as part of the licensing discussed above–i.e., an exclusive license for use by SAMR to manufacture and supply the Limited License Products for SAMR’s own use (in the Limited Territory) and to manufacture and supply the Products to us or our affiliates (for Aridis’s use outside the Limited Territory) at commercially reasonable rates, and at sufficient capacity as specified in a manufacturing agreement that shall be negotiated and executed in good faith. The term of the manufacturing agreement shall be twenty (20) years. If a third-party sublicensee of Aridis Products wishes to have Aridis Product manufactured by itself for the territory for which it has a license from us, then we shall have the right to buy back the manufacturing rights by paying to SAMR $5 million.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAMR agrees to exercise or waive this option by December 31, 2021. However, in order to exercise the option SAMR must first demonstrate, to our reasonable satisfaction, SAMR’s ability for manufacturing consistency of Limited License Products in conformance to all regulatory FDA and EMA requirements. SAMR acknowledges that is must meet expected timelines for the expected approval date for the first Licensed Product and will need to have completed a ready production facility within a specified timeline in order to allow sufficient time for demonstration of capacity and consistency and completion of Quality Agreements. SAMR has not exercised this option as of December 31, 2021.

e. | Development Support Activities – we will share our know-how related to the products in order to assist SAMR is its efforts to develop, receive regulatory approval for, and manufacture and sale the licensed products in SAMR’s authorized territories. This will be performed under the direction of a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) and will follow the development plan approved by the JSC. As part of these activities each party shall share all relevant clinical data and regulatory documentation created by it anywhere in the world.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, in certain circumstances, SAMR and us will agree to commit to negotiate in good faith to extend the rights granted in the License Agreement to include an exclusive license to make, have made, import, use and have used, and sell and have sold, certain Aridis Products in the European Union during the Term. Such an obligation upon us to negotiate such rights is preconditioned upon the demonstration of certain milestones by SAMR, including its obtaining, under certain funding programs, sufficient financial support to cover all requisite clinical development and manufacturing development costs, under terms which allow distribution of Aridis Products at commercially reasonable prices and without materially hindering distribution of Aridis Products in any other territories.
Pursuant to the License Agreement, SAMR shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals, to have approved for commercialization and sale, and to commercialize and sell (i) Aridis Products in the Limited Territory, and (ii) SAMR Products and the AR-201 product in the Worldwide Territory.
In addition to the upfront payments noted above, upon the achievement of certain milestones, SAMR shall pay us up to $42.5 million in milestone fees related to the products covered in the License Agreement. SAMR shall also be obligated to pay us royalties ranging from 4% to 6% on net sales of all licensed products, except for Aridis Products in the European Union, should such be authorized at a later date, which require payment of 20% royalties on the net sales of those products.

Government Regulation
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, among others.
The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time-consuming.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational drug candidate into healthy human subjects or patients, the investigational drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers.
If an investigational drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within ten months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory 

39



committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA or, in the case of a biologic, the BLA unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the marketing application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA’s general biological product standards.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will re-initiate review. If the FDA is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the agency will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug product is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Orphan Drug Act in the United States
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the U.S. during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug.
QIDP Designation is awarded to antibacterial or antifungal product candidates for human use that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections caused by certain bacterial or fungal pathogens that are deemed to be a particular threat to public health. QIDP designated products have a five-year market exclusivity extension and receive priority review for the first application submitted for product approval.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
Products authorized as “orphan medicinal products” in the EU are entitled to certain exclusivity benefits. In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
An application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

40



Products authorized in the EU as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:

● | The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Requirements
Once a NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of therapeutic products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Companion Diagnostic Review and Approval
Some of our product candidates currently may rely upon the use of a companion microbial diagnostic test to select patients who are infected with either S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or A. baumannii bacteria and in the future, we may utilize other biomarkers as companion diagnostic tests for our other product candidates. Approval of our product candidates may require FDA approval of a Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, for a reproducible, validated diagnostic test to be used with our mAb product candidates.
The PMA process is costly, lengthy, and uncertain, although the PMA review for the microbial tests is not currently planned to occur concurrently with the development and review of a BLA for our product candidates. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of commercial approval for our product candidates. Human diagnostic products are subject to pervasive and ongoing regulatory obligations, including the submission of medical device reports, adherence to the Quality Systems Regulation, recordkeeping and product labeling, as enforced by the FDA and comparable state authorities.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug and biologic product candidates which obtain marketing approval. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical manufacturers are exposed, directly, or indirectly, through customers, to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which a pharmaceutical manufacturer can market, sell and distribute drug and biologic products. These laws include, but are not limited to:
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind, to induce or reward either the referring of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally financed healthcare program. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Federal Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with certain expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, benefits, items or services.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly 

42



applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
State laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.
Health care reform measures could adversely affect our business
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implementation of the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act”;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

43




● | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. During President Trump’s administration, he signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA.
Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the PPACA would have on our business remains unclear. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the biosimilars provisions under the PPACA to our product candidates. The FDA has issued several guidance documents, and withdrawn others, but no implementing regulations on biosimilars have been adopted. A number of biosimilar applications have been approved over the past few years. It is not certain that we will receive 12 years of biologics marketing exclusivity for any of our products. The regulations that are ultimately promulgated and their implementation are likely to have considerable impact on the way we conduct our business and may require us to change current strategies. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved drug notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the approved drug in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.
Individual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and 

44



individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce ultimate demand for certain products or put pressure on product pricing, which could negatively affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
In addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to generate revenues. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on our ability to profitably price our products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We might elect not to seek approval for or market our products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue we generate from our product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.
Furthermore, regulatory authorities’ assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.
Regulation in the European Union
Biologics are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the U.S. In the EU, for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the EU, which includes most major countries in Europe. If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the EU under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory approval through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Reimbursement
Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that can require the provision of supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of drug or biologic products to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers operating costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S.
There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict what third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for new drug and biologic product candidates. An inability 

45



to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products could have a material adverse effect on a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and overall financial condition.
Reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
In addition, it is expected that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities will continue and place further pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products that gain regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
