Overview 
 We were originally incorporated in California in January 1992 and were reincorporated in Delaware in May 1996. 
 We are a company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing innovative and life-changing pharmaceuticals, in diseases with high unmet medical needs, through our novel R&D platform, focused on neurological and endocrine based diseases and disorders. Our portfolio of products and product candidates is led by INGREZZA® (valbenazine), a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor for the treatment of movement disorders which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 11, 2017 for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Our three lead late-stage clinical programs are INGREZZA (valbenazine) for Tourette syndrome, elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for womens health that is partnered with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), and opicapone, a highly-selective catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor (COMT inhibitor) that is an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors for adult patients with Parkinsons disease and was in-licensed from BIAL  Portela & CA, S.A. (BIAL). 
 We believe that INGREZZA has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders beyond TD and we plan to continue to study the use of INGREZZA in other disease states. We are currently investigating the utilization of INGREZZA in Tourette syndrome. We have completed three clinical trials in Tourettes patients and a Phase IIb study in children with Tourette syndrome is currently ongoing. We intend to utilize the results of these studies to discuss with the FDA a plan for New Drug Application (NDA) submission for INGREZZA in Tourette syndrome patients.

 Our partner AbbVie has successfully completed the placebo-controlled portion of two Phase III studies of elagolix in women with endometriosis. Based on the positive results of these studies, AbbVie submitted an NDA to the FDA for elagolix to treat women with endometriosis during the third quarter of 2017. The NDA was accepted for priority review by the FDA and given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, AbbVie is also assessing elagolix in women with uterine fibroids. The Phase III program began in early 2016 with two replicate studies of women with heavy uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. AbbVie expects initial top-line efficacy data from the Phase III uterine fibroids program to be available in the first quarter of 2018, and based on the results of the study anticipates a subsequent NDA submission in 2019. 
 On February 9, 2017, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone in the United States and Canada. Opicapone is a once-daily, peripherally-acting, highly-selective COMT inhibitor that was approved in June 2016 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors for adult patients with Parkinsons disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations. We held a meeting with the FDA in January 2018 to discuss a potential NDA submission for opicapone and we are currently awaiting the final summary meeting minutes which we expect to receive in February 2018. We intend to commercialize opicapone in the United States and Canada upon the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.

 INGREZZA® (valbenazine)  Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 Inhibitor (VMAT2) 
 VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control. Disease states such as TD, Tourette syndrome, Huntingtons chorea, schizophrenia, and tardive dystonia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain, and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with these conditions, among others. 
 INGREZZA as a Treatment for Tardive Dyskinesia. TD is defined by hyperkinetic involuntary movements which arise after months or years of treatment with dopamine receptor blocking agents, e.g. antipsychotics used for treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, and Reglan® (metoclopramide) for nausea and vomiting and gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis. Features of TD may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking. Rapid movements of the extremities may also occur. The impact on daily function and the quality of life for individuals suffering from TD can be substantial. While the prevalence rates of TD can vary greatly in accordance with the population being studied, it is estimated that approximately 500,000 individuals are affected by TD in the United States alone (Kantar Health). 
 On April 11, 2017, INGREZZA became the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of TD. INGREZZA provides a once-daily dosing treatment option for TD causing reversible reduction of dopamine release at the nerve terminal by selectively inhibiting the pre-synaptic VMAT2. In vitro, INGREZZA is a highly selective inhibitor of human VMAT2 showing little or no affinity for VMAT1, other receptors, such as dopamine D2 receptors, other transporters or ion channels. INGREZZA for TD has two dosing options (40 mg and 80 mg) with 40 mg taken for the first seven days of treatment with an option of 40 mg or 80 mg thereafter depending on a patients dosing needs. INGREZZA was generally well tolerated during our clinical trials with no apparent drug-drug interactions with the most common emergent adverse event being mild and transient somnolence. 
 In connection with the FDA approval of INGREZZA for TD, we have committed to conduct certain post-marketing studies including Phase 1 (e.g., pharmacokinetics (PK) in volunteers with renal impairment) and Phase 4 (e.g., randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal in TD patients). We expect to conduct these studies over the next four years in accordance with FDA guidance. 
 Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder that consists of rapid, non-rhythmic stereotyped motor and vocal tics. Motor tics are typically characterized by facial grimacing, head jerks, extremity movements and other dystonic movements. Vocal tics typically include grunting, throat clearing, and repeating words and phrases. The average age of onset for Tourette syndrome is approximately six years, with symptoms reaching their peak severity at approximately age ten. Tourette syndrome is more commonly diagnosed in males than females and may also be associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. We were granted FDA Orphan Drug Designation for valbenazine for the treatment of pediatric patients with Tourette s syndrome in 2017. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to drugs that are intended to treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The orphan drug 
 
5 


  designation allows the orphan drug indication for the drug to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug, as well as other development assistance and financial incentives. 
 We have completed juvenile rodent preclinical studies of INGREZZA and based on the results of these preclinical studies, we initiated the T-Force Study in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome in early 2015. The T-Force Study was an open-label, multiple ascending dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and exposure-response of INGREZZA in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome. A total of 28 patients were evaluated over 14 days of once daily dosing followed by 7 days off-drug at 10 study centers in the United States. The study was divided into two dosing groups consisting of children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-18), and each age group was further divided into three dosing cohorts. Subsequent dose escalations for children and adolescents were based, in part, on the pharmacokinetic and safety data from the previous cohort in each age group. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale was also assessed and after two weeks of treatment showed a mean reduction of 31% from baseline scores, with over half of the subjects considered clinical responders. Based on the results of the T-Force study, we initiated the Phase II program in Tourette syndrome. 
 The T-Forward study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, parallel group, study that enrolled 124 adults with moderate to severe Tourette syndrome. Two once-daily fixed doses of INGREZZA were evaluated versus placebo in a 1:1:1 randomization. The three-arm study included eight weeks of dosing followed by two weeks off-drug at 32 study centers in the United States to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of INGREZZA in Tourette patients. The primary endpoint of this study was a change from baseline of placebo versus active scores utilizing the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale at the end of week 8. Tourette symptoms were also be evaluated via the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale as well as Clinical Global Impression of Change scales, among others. While the T-Forward study showed a significant improvement in overall symptoms of Tourette syndrome as evidenced by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (p=0.015), the pre-specified primary endpoint, the change-from-baseline in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale at week 8 was not met (p=0.18). Adverse events were dose dependent and consistent with earlier clinical studies. 
 The T-Force GREEN study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, parallel group, Phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of INGREZZA in up to 90 pediatric patients with moderate to severe Tourette syndrome. Once-daily fixed doses of INGREZZA were evaluated versus placebo in a 1:1:1 randomization. The three-arm study evaluated 98 children and adolescents over six weeks of dosing followed by two weeks off-drug at approximately 40 study centers in the United States. The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale between placebo and active treatment groups at the end of week six. Exposure-response analysis showed that selected doses for the T-Force GREEN study were below the therapeutic range for adequate tic reduction in the majority of subjects. For the subset of subjects with pharmaceutical exposure in the appropriate range, there was a substantial reduction in tics. For subjects with sub-therapeutic exposure, tic reduction was comparable to placebo. Adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous INGREZZA studies. 
 Based on the results of the T-Force GREEN study and earlier studies of INGREZZA in Tourette patients, we initiated the T-Force GOLD study in October 2017. This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase IIb study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and optimal dose of once-daily INGREZZA in up to 120 pediatric patients with moderate to severe Tourette syndrome. Patients will receive either once-daily dosing of INGREZZA or placebo using a 1:1 randomization over 12 weeks of dosing followed by two weeks off-drug. The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale between placebo and active treatment groups at the end of week 12. Tourette symptoms will also be evaluated via the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale as well as Clinical Global Impression Scales. Top-line data from this study is expected in late 2018.

 elagolix  Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Antagonist 
 GnRH is a peptide that stimulates the secretion of the pituitary hormones that are responsible for sex steroid production and normal reproductive function. Researchers have found that chronic administration of GnRH agonists, after initial stimulation, reversibly shuts down this transmitter pathway and is clinically useful in treating hormone-dependent diseases such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Several companies have developed peptide GnRH agonists on this principle, such as Lupron® and Zoladex®. However, since these molecules are peptides, they must be injected via a depot formulation rather than the preferred oral route of administration. In addition, GnRH agonists can take up to several weeks to exert their desired effect once the initial stimulation has occurred, a factor not seen with the use of GnRH antagonists. Upon administration, GnRH agonists have shown a tendency to exacerbate the condition via a hormonal flare. More importantly the profound suppression effect observed with GnRH agonists is similar to that seen after menopause and can be associated with hot flushes and the loss of bone mineral density. 
 Orally active, nonpeptide GnRH antagonists potentially offer several advantages over injectable GnRH peptide drugs, including rapid onset of hormone suppression without hormonal flare. Also, injection site reactions commonly observed in peptide depots are avoided and dosing can be rapidly discontinued if necessary  a clinical management option not available with long-acting depot injections. Additionally, by using GnRH antagonists, it may be possible to alter the level of pituitary GnRH suppression thereby titrating circulating hormone levels. 
 In June 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration with AbbVie to develop and commercialize elagolix and all next-generation non-peptide GnRH antagonists (collectively, GnRH Compounds) for womens and mens health indications. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs and has primary responsibility for all regulatory interactions with the FDA related to elagolix and other GnRH Compounds covered by the collaboration. AbbVie is currently in Phase III evaluation of elagolix in two indications, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. 
 Endometriosis. Endometriosis is associated with a multitude of symptoms, some of the most common of which include pain related both to menstruation (dysmenorrhea) and sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) as well as chronic pelvic pain throughout the menstrual cycle, infertility, and menorrhagia, among many others. The wide range of symptoms associated with endometriosis serves to complicate and delay diagnosis due to the significant overlap of symptoms with the disease profiles of other conditions. The World Endometriosis Research Foundation estimates that there are over 170 million women worldwide who suffer from endometriosis, including approximately 7.5 million women in the United States alone. We believe that the availability of an oral treatment, lacking the side effect profile of the currently available peptide GnRH agonists, may be a desirable alternative to current pharmaceutical therapies and ultimately encourage a significantly higher treatment rate. 
 The endometriosis Phase III program evaluated two separate doses of elagolix (150mg once daily and 200mg twice daily) over a 24-week treatment period. The initial randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trial (Violet PETAL) enrolled 872 women in approximately 160 clinical sites throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The co-primary endpoints were a comparison of the daily non-menstrual pelvic pain and daily dysmenorrhea scores during the third month of treatment to the respective daily baseline scores utilizing a responder analysis. Maintenance of response at month six was also assessed utilizing the same daily scales. 
 In January 2015, AbbVie announced the top-line results of the initial six months of placebo-controlled dosing of the Violet PETAL study. After six months of continuous treatment, both doses of elagolix (150mg once daily and 200mg twice daily) met the studys co-primary endpoints (p<0.001) of reducing scores of non-menstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis, at month three, as well as at month six. 
 The observed safety profile of elagolix in the Violet PETAL study was consistent with observations from earlier clinical studies. Among the most common adverse events were hot flush, headache, nausea and fatigue.

  While most adverse events were similar across treatment groups, some, such as hot flush and bone mineral density loss, were dose-dependent. Overall discontinuation rates were similar across treatment groups and discontinuations specifically due to adverse events were 5.9%, 6.4%, and 9.7% for placebo, 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily, respectively. 
 Additional efficacy and safety endpoints for the patients enrolled in the Violet PETAL study were measured through one year of continuous dosing as well as for a period of time after the final dose. The one-year dosing portion of this study concluded in mid-2015. In July 2015, AbbVie announced that the efficacy and safety data at one year was consistent with the data witnessed at six months. 
 In February 2016, AbbVie announced the top-line results from the second of the two Phase III elagolix endometriosis clinical trials, the Solstice Study, a multinational study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix in 815 premenopausal women with endometriosis. The top-line results from this trial were consistent with those of the Violet PETAL Study; after six months of treatment, both doses of elagolix (150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily) met the Solstice Studys co-primary endpoints of reducing scores of non-menstrual pelvic pain and menstrual pain (or dysmenorrhea) associated with endometriosis at month three, as well as month six. The observed safety profile of elagolix in the Solstice Study was consistent with observations from prior studies. Among the most common adverse events were hot flush, headache, and nausea. While most adverse events were similar across treatment groups some, such as hot flush and bone mineral density loss, were dose-dependent. Overall discontinuation rates were similar across treatment groups (25.3%, 21.2%, and 19.7% for placebo, 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily, respectively); discontinuations specifically due to treatment emergent adverse events were 6.1%, 4.4%, and 10.0% for placebo, 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily, respectively. Patients in the Solstice Study were eligible to continue on in either post-treatment follow-up or a blinded extension study for an additional six-month safety and efficacy evaluation of elagolix. 
 During the third quarter of 2017, AbbVie submitted an NDA for elagolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA. The NDA was accepted for priority review by the FDA and given a PDUFA date in the second quarter of 2018. 
 Uterine Fibroids. Uterine fibroids are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus. They are the most common solid tumor in women with a prevalence rate of at least 25% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). While many women do not have symptoms, depending on the size, location and number, uterine fibroids can cause symptoms such as: longer, more frequent, or heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual pain, vaginal bleeding at time other than menstruation, pain in the abdomen or lower back, pain during sex, difficulty urinating, frequent urination, constipation or rectal pain. Due to the severity of symptoms, treatment sometimes requires surgery, including the removal of the uterus. In fact, uterine fibroids is a leading indication for hysterectomy in the United States, with approximately 250,000 hysterectomies performed each year related to uterine fibroids (Whiteman et al AJOG 2008, 198, e1). We believe that a safe and effective oral therapy would be a preferred treatment regimen rather than surgical intervention. 
 AbbVie conducted a Phase IIb clinical trial that enrolled approximately 570 women with heavy uterine bleeding due to uterine fibroids at approximately 100 sites in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Chile and the United Kingdom. The trial was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, two cohort design study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of two different elagolix treatment regimens (300mg twice daily and 600mg once daily) alone and in combination with two different strengths of hormonal add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate). The primary endpoint of the study was an assessment of uterine blood loss after six months of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in uterine volume, fibroid volume, and menstrual patterns. Safety assessments of bone mineral density, comparing baseline to month six, were performed via DXA scan. Patients were also followed off drug for up to six months. 
 Results from this Phase IIb study show elagolix reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in all treatment arms. The studys primary endpoint, a composite design where subjects had to achieve a menstrual blood loss (MBL) 
 
8 


  volume of less than 80 mL as well as a 50 percent or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline at the final study month, was met for all dosing regimens (p<0.001) as assessed utilizing a quantitative measure of reduction in uterine blood flow, the alkaline hematin method. 
 Among the most common adverse events were hot flush, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Some adverse events such as hot flush were more frequent in the elagolix only treatment arms versus the placebo and elagolix with hormonal add back therapy treatment arms. Reduction in bone mineral density associated with elagolix alone was attenuated when elagolix was co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy. 
 AbbVie initiated Phase III studies of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids in early 2016. The Phase III program includes two replicate, pivotal, six-month efficacy and safety studies followed by a six-month safety and efficacy extension study. AbbVie is evaluating 300mg of elagolix dosed twice daily both alone and in combination with hormonal add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate). The primary endpoint in these Phase III studies will be the same as that employed in the Phase IIb study: percent of subjects with reduction in uterine blood flow as measured by the alkaline hematin method. AbbVie expects initial top-line data from this Phase III program in the first quarter of 2018, and based on the results of the study anticipates a subsequent NDA submission in 2019. 
 opicapone, Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Inhibitor 
 COMT inhibitors are utilized to prolong the duration of effect of levodopa which is utilized as a primary treatment option for Parkinsons disease patients. Administration of levodopa often results in adequate control of Parkinsons symptoms, also referred to as on-time, however, there are periods of the day where the effects of levodopa wear off and motor symptoms worsen, these are considered off-time. Opicapone is a novel, once-daily, peripherally-acting, highly-selective COMT inhibitor utilized as adjunct therapy to levodopa in Parkinsons patients. Opicapone works through decreasing the conversion rate of levodopa into 3-O-methyldopa, thereby reducing the off-time period in patients with Parkinsons and extending the on-time period. 
 In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinsons disease, in the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of opicapone in the United States and Canada. 
 Parkinsons Disease. Parkinsons disease is a chronic and progressive movement disorder that affects approximately one million people in the United States. The disease is characterized by a loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, the area of the brain where dopamine is produced. Dopamine production and synthesis is necessary for coordination and movement. As Parkinsons progresses, dopamine production steadily decreases resulting in tremor, slowed movement (bradykinesia), impaired posture and balance, and speech and writing problems. There is no present cure for Parkinsons and management consists of controlling the motor symptoms primarily through administration of levodopa therapies. While this improves the control of Parkinsons symptoms, as the disease progresses the beneficial effects of levodopa begin to wear off, symptoms worsen and patients experience end-of-dose motor fluctuations. These end of dose motor fluctuations are improved with the addition of a COMT inhibitor to levodopa. 
 In June 2016, the EMA authorized ONGENTYS® (opicapone) as an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCIs) in adult patients with Parkinsons disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations. This approval was based on data from a clinical development program that included 28 clinical studies of more than 900 patients treated with opicapone in 30 countries worldwide. 
 The two pivotal Phase III studies utilized for European approval, BIPARK-I and BIPARK-II, demonstrated that opicapone once-daily achieved a statistically significant decrease in off-time periods for Parkinsons patients 
 
9 


  compared to placebo. The BIPARK-I study was a placebo-controlled study of approximately 600 patients that also included entacapone as an active comparator. The results of this study also showed that once-daily opicapone was non-inferior to entacapone which is dosed multiple times per day. The BIPARK-II study was a placebo-controlled study of approximately 400 patients that also showed a significant decrease in off-time periods for Parkinsons patients. In both studies, opicapone was associated with significant improvements in both patient and clinician global assessments of change. The data from these two Phase III trials also demonstrated that opicapone improved motor fluctuations in levodopa-treated patients regardless of concomitant dopamine agonist or monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors used. Opicapone was generally well tolerated and was not associated with relevant electrocardiographic or hepatic adverse events. 
 Both of the BIPARK Phase III trials included a one-year open-label extension where opicapone sustained the decrease in off-time and increase in on-time periods that was demonstrated during the double-blind placebo-controlled portion of the studies. 
 We held a meeting with the FDA in January 2018 to discuss a potential NDA submission for opicapone and we are currently awaiting the final summary meeting minutes which we expect to receive in February 2018. We intend to commercialize opicapone in the United States and Canada, subject to regulatory approvals. 
 NBI-74788- Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) Receptor1 Antagonist 
 CRF is a hypothalamic hormone released directly into the hypophyseal portal vasculature which acts on specific CRF1 receptors on corticotropes in the anterior pituitary to stimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). The primary role of ACTH is the stimulation of the synthesis and release of adrenal steroids including cortisol. Cortisol from the adrenals have a negative feedback role at the level of the hypothalamus that decreases CRF release as well as at the level of the pituitary to inhibit the release of ACTH. This tight control loop is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Blockade of CRF receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH and subsequently attenuate the production and release of adrenal steroids. 
 Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (classic CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders that affects approximately 20,000-30,000 people in the United States and results in an enzyme deficiency altering the production of adrenal steroids. Because of this deficiency, the adrenal glands have little to no cortisol biosynthesis resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition. If left untreated, classic CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and eventually death. Even with cortisol replacement, persistent elevation of ACTH from the pituitary gland results in excessive androgen levels leading to virilization of females including precocious puberty, menstrual irregularity, short stature, hirsutism, acne and fertility problems. 
 Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for classic CAH and are used chronically to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency and to reduce the excessive ACTH levels and androgen excess. However, the dose and duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushings syndrome as common and serious side effects. 
 NBI-74788 is a potent, selective, orally-active, CRF receptor antagonist as demonstrated in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. Blockade of CRF receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal steroids including androgens, and potentially the symptoms associated with classic CAH. Lower ACTH levels would also reduce the amount of exogenous corticosteroid necessary for classic CAH patients to thrive avoiding the side-effects currently associated with excessive steroid therapy. 
 We conducted a Phase I single ascending dose study of NBI-74788 in healthy volunteers in 2017. Based on the positive results of this Phase I study we initiated a Phase II clinical trial of NBI-74788 in adult patients with 
 
10 


  refractory classic CAH. This pilot study is designed to be an open-label, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study assessing two single, ascending doses of NBI-74788 in up to twenty study participants. Key pharmacodynamic biomarker measurements include ACTH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androgen, and cortisol levels collected the morning following bedtime dosing. 
 We intend to apply for orphan drug designation for NBI-74788 in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States and provides sponsors with development and commercial incentives for such designated compounds and medicines. 
 Research Programs 
 Our research and development focus is on addressing diseases and disorders of the central nervous and endocrine systems, which include therapeutic categories ranging from HPA disorders to stress-related disorders and neurological/neuropsychiatric diseases. Central nervous system and endocrinology drug therapies are among the largest therapeutic categories, accounting for over $150 billion in worldwide drug sales according to GlobalData (2014). 
 Neurological/Neuropsychiatric: VMAT2 Inhibitors 
 VMAT2 inhibition results in the modulation of dopamine pathways which may also be useful for patients suffering from schizophrenia. Approximately 2.2 million people in the Unites States suffer from schizophrenia at an estimated annual cost of $62 billion. Our discovery efforts around VMAT2 inhibitors also focus on developing novel therapies for schizophrenia sufferers. 
 Essential Tremor 
 Essential tremor is one of the most common neurological disorders in adults, impacting an estimated 10 million individuals in the United States (International Essential Tremor Foundation). The disorder is characterized by involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movements that most often affect the upper limbs. As the disease progresses, tremor severity often increases and spreads to other parts of the body. Essential tremor has a significant impact on the activities of daily living often resulting in functional disability as the disease progresses and is associated with a high comorbidity rate of social phobia, depression and anxiety. Current pharmacological therapies utilized in the treatment of essential tremor include propranolol and primidone. Deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure involving the implantation of electrodes within certain areas of the brain, is sometimes utilized for severe essential tremor. 
 CNS Disorders (Targeted by G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Ion Channels) 
 G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are the largest known gene superfamily of the human genome. Greater than thirty percent of all marketed prescription drugs act on GPCRs; which makes this class of proteins historically the most successful therapeutic target family. However, only a small fraction of the GPCR gene superfamily has been exploited. Ion channels appear to be represented by approximately 400 genes in the human genome and are currently the targets for approximately seven percent of the current marketed drugs. Next-generation therapies derived from targeting GPCRs and ion channels will be discovered through the understanding of the complex relationships of drug/receptor interactions and their subsequent impact on efficacy, downstream signaling networks and regulation. 
 Our GPCR research platform has met this requirement by integrating drug discovery research efforts with a suite of assays and assay systems and automated analytical techniques. This process, now also applied to ion channels, provides an unbiased profile of pharmacological protein/ligand interactions coupled with in vivo efficacy using discrete animal models allowing for rapid discovery of initial leads and advancement into 
 
11 


  preclinical and clinical development. Importantly, this design cycle is not limited to GPCRs or ion channel targets, but can be utilized for other recently identified proteins that play a role in human disease where current treatments or therapies are either inadequate or nonexistent. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurological and endocrine-related diseases and disorders. The following are the key elements of our business strategy: 
 Continuing to Advance and Build Our Product Portfolio Focused on Neurological and Endocrine-Related Diseases and Disorders. We believe that by continuing to advance and extend our product pipeline, we can mitigate some of the clinical development risks associated with drug development. We currently have multiple programs in various stages of research and development. Our three lead late-stage clinical programs are elagolix, a GnRH antagonist in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids that is partnered with AbbVie, INGREZZA (valbenazine), our VMAT2 inhibitor for the treatment of movement disorders which is in Phase IIb development for Tourette syndrome, and opicapone, a highly-selective COMT inhibitor that is an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors for adult patients with Parkinsons disease and was in-licensed from BIAL. We take a portfolio approach to managing our pipeline that balances the size of the market opportunities with clear and defined clinical and regulatory paths to approval. By doing so, we focus our internal development resources on innovative therapies with improved probabilities of technical and commercial success. 
 Maintaining Certain Commercial Rights to Our Product Portfolio to Evolve into a Fully-Integrated Pharmaceutical Company. In April 2017, we received approval from the FDA for INGREZZA for the treatment of TD. We market INGREZZA for TD in the United States through our specialty sales force focused primarily on physicians who treat TD patients, including psychiatrists and neurologists. The commercial launch of INGREZZA, with our field-based sales team of approximately 160 personnel, occurred on May 1, 2017. This entire commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance. We intend to retain commercial rights to certain products, including INGREZZA, that we can effectively and efficiently develop, secure regulatory approval and commercialize, which includes products with a concentrated prescriber base and well-defined patient population that can be accessed with an efficient patient and prescriber outreach program. 
 Selectively Establishing Corporate Collaborations with Global Pharmaceutical Companies to Assist in the Development of Our Products and Mitigate Financial Risk while Retaining Significant Commercial Upside. We leverage the development, regulatory and commercialization expertise of our corporate collaborators to accelerate the development of certain of our product candidates, while typically retaining co-promotional rights, and at times commercial rights, in North America, as in the case of our collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe. We intend to further leverage our resources by selectively entering into additional strategic alliances to enhance our internal development and commercialization capabilities by licensing our technology. 
 Identifying Novel Drugs to Address Unmet Market Opportunities. We seek to identify and validate novel drugs on characterized targets for internal development or collaboration. For example, GnRH antagonists, compounds designed to reduce the secretions of sex steroids, may represent the first novel non-peptide, non-injectable means of treatment of endometriosis. We believe the creativity and productivity of our discovery research group will continue to be a critical component for our continued success. Research and development costs were $121.8 million, $94.3 million and $81.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Acquiring Rights to Complementary Drug Candidates and Technologies. We plan to continue to selectively acquire rights to products in various stages of development to take advantage of our drug development 
 
12 


  capabilities. For example, in February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinsons disease, in the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of opicapone in the United States and Canada. 
 Our Corporate Collaborations and Strategic Alliances 
 One of our business strategies is to utilize strategic alliances to enhance our development and commercialization capabilities. The following is a summary of our significant collaborations/alliances: 
 AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie). In June 2010, we announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration with AbbVie to develop and commercialize elagolix and all next-generation GnRH antagonists (collectively, GnRH Compounds) for womens and mens health. AbbVie made an upfront payment of $75 million and has agreed to make additional development and regulatory event based payments of up to $480 million and up to an additional $50 million in commercial event based payments. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs. We received funding for certain internal collaboration expenses which included reimbursement from AbbVie for internal and external expenses related to the GnRH Compounds and personnel funding through the end of 2012. We will be entitled to a percentage of worldwide sales of GnRH Compounds for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights. Under the terms of our agreement with AbbVie, the collaborative development effort between the parties to advance GnRH compounds towards commercialization was governed by a joint development committee with representatives from both us and AbbVie. The collaborative development portion of the agreement concluded, as scheduled, on December 31, 2012. AbbVie may terminate the collaboration at its discretion upon 180 days written notice to us. In such event, we would be entitled to specified payments for ongoing clinical development and related activities and all GnRH Compound product rights would revert to us. Since the inception of the agreement, we have recorded revenues of $75.0 million related to the amortization of up-front license fees, $75.0 million in milestone revenue, and $37.0 million of sponsored development revenue. 
 Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (Mitsubishi Tanabe). In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe for the development and commercialization of INGREZZA for movement disorders in Japan and other select Asian markets. Mitsubishi Tanabe made an up-front license fee payment of $30 million and has agreed to make additional development and commercialization event-based payments totaling up to $85 million, payments for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, and royalties on product sales in select territories in Asia. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi Tanabe is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs in Japan and other select Asian markets with the exception of a single Huntingtons chorea clinical trial to be performed by us, at an estimated cost of approximately $12 million, should Mitsubishi Tanabe request the clinical trial. We will be entitled to a percentage of sales of INGREZZA in Japan and other select Asian markets for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights. Mitsubishi Tanabe may terminate the agreement at its discretion upon 180 days written notice to us. In such event, all INGREZZA product rights for Japan and other select Asian markets would revert to us. Since the inception of the agreement, we have recorded revenues of $19.8 million related to the up-front license fee, and $15.0 million in milestone revenue. 
 BIAL  Portela & Ca, S.A. (BIAL). In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinsons disease, in the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for the management and cost of all opicapone development and commercialization activities in the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid BIAL an upfront license fee of $30 million, and we may also be required to pay up to an additional $115 million in milestone payments associated with the regulatory approval and net sales of products containing opicapone. In addition, we will pay BIAL a percentage of net sales (with a floor minimum) in exchange for the manufacture and supply of opicapone drug product. 
 
13 


 Upon commercialization, BIAL and Neurocrine will agree on annual sales forecasts. If we fail to meet the minimum sales requirements for a particular year, we will be required to pay BIAL an amount corresponding to the difference between the actual net sales and the minimum sales requirements for such year, and if we fail to meet the minimum sales requirements for any two consecutive years, BIAL may terminate the agreement. The agreement also contemplates that we will purchase, and BIAL will supply, all drug product and investigation medicinal product for our development and commercialization activities. BIAL has the right to co-promote opicapone within the United States and Canada during certain periods of time. If BIAL exercises its option to co-promote the licensed products, we will enter into a co-promotion agreement with BIAL at a future time. 
 The agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until a generic product in respect of such licensed product under the agreement is sold in a country and sales of such generic product are greater than a specified percentage of total sales of such licensed product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other partys insolvency. BIAL may terminate the agreement if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts or fail to file an NDA for a licensed product by a specified date or under certain circumstances involving a change of control. In certain circumstances where BIAL elects to terminate the agreement in connection with our change of control, BIAL shall pay us a termination fee. We can terminate the agreement at any time for any reason upon six months written notice to BIAL if prior to the first NDA approval in the United States, and upon nine months written notice to BIAL if such notice is given after the first NDA approval in the United States. If our termination request occurs prior to the first NDA approval in the United States, we will have to pay BIAL a termination fee except under certain conditions specified in the agreement. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We seek to protect our lead compounds, compound libraries, expressed proteins, synthetic organic processes, formulations, assays, cloned targets, screening technology and other technologies by filing, or by causing to be filed on our behalf, patent applications in the United States and abroad. Additionally, we have licensed from institutions the rights to issued United States patents, pending United States patent applications, and issued and pending foreign filings. We face the risk that one or more of the above patent applications may be denied. We also face the risk that issued patents that we own or license may be challenged or circumvented or may otherwise not provide protection for any commercially viable products we develop. 
 The technologies we use in our research, as well as the drug targets we select, may infringe the patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties. If this occurs, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue with the commercialization of our products. 
 In addition to the granted and potential patent protection, the United States, the European Union and Japan all provide data and marketing exclusivity for new medicinal compounds. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the original applicants data as the basis of a generic marketing application during the period of data and marketing exclusivity. This period of exclusivity is generally five years in the United States, six years in Japan and ten years in the European Union, measured from the date of FDA, or corresponding foreign regulatory authority, approval. 
 Elagolix, our small molecule GnRH antagonist currently in clinical trials for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids, is covered by six issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,872,728, 7,179,815 and 7,462,625 are due to expire in 2021 (not including potential patent term extensions of up to five years) while U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,927, 7,176,211 and 7,419,983 are due to expire in 2024 (not including potential patent term extensions of up to five years). 
 INGREZZA (valbenazine), our highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor, currently in clinical trials for the treatment Tourette syndrome, is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,039,627, which expires in 2029 (not including a 
 
14 


  potential patent term extension of up to two years) and U.S. Patent No. 8,357,697, which expires in 2027. INGREZZA is also covered by European Patent No. 2,081,929, which expires in 2027. 
 Opicapone, a highly selective COMT inhibitor for Parkinsons disease is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,168,793, among others, which expires in 2029 (not including a potential patent term extension of up to five years). 
 Manufacturing and Distribution 
 We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, contract manufacturers to produce INGREZZA, as well as for our existing and future product candidates. We believe this outsourcing manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to our commercialization efforts without devoting the resources and capital required to build manufacturing facilities. 
 We have established an internal pharmaceutical development group to develop manufacturing methods for our product candidates, to optimize manufacturing processes, and to select and transfer these manufacturing technologies to our suppliers. We have also established an internal commercial supply team to manage all aspects related to the INGREZZA commercial supply chain. We have entered into long-term contracts with multiple manufacturers to ensure adequate product supply and to mitigate risk. 
 There currently are a limited number of these manufacturers. Furthermore, some of the contract manufacturers that we have identified to date only have limited experience at manufacturing, formulating, analyzing and packaging our products and product candidates in quantities sufficient for conducting clinical trials or for commercialization. We attempt to acquire adequate inventory of materials and/or finished product to avoid significant supply disruption. 
 Additionally, we have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the distribution of INGREZZA, including shipping, warehousing, customer service, order-taking and processing, invoicing, collections, and other distribution-related activities. 
 We have entered into distribution agreements for INGREZZA with a limited number of select pharmacies (SP) and select distributors (SD), and all of our product sales are to these customers. SPs subsequently dispense INGREZZA to patients based on the fulfillment of a prescription and SDs sell INGREZZA primarily to government facilities and in-patient hospital pharmacies. Our agreements with SPs and SDs provide for transfer of title to the product at the time the product is delivered to the SP or SD. Our three largest customers represented 99% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Master Manufacturing Services Agreement and Product Agreement 
 We entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement with Patheon UK Limited (Patheon) in November 2016, and a related Amended and Restated Product Agreement in July 2017, for Patheons manufacture of commercial supplies of INGREZZA at Patheons manufacturing site. Under the terms of the agreements, we are responsible for supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredients for INGREZZA to Patheon. Patheon is responsible for manufacturing the INGREZZA capsules, conducting quality control, quality assurance, validation activities, stability testing, packaging and providing related services for the manufacture of the INGREZZA capsules. 
 Pursuant to the agreements, we have agreed to order from Patheon certain annual binding minimum amounts of INGREZZA capsules based on an agreed upon pricing schedule. The agreements have an initial term ending in December 2021, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreements within at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. 
 
15 


 Commercial Packaging Agreement 
 We entered into a Commercial Packaging Agreement with AndersonBrecon Inc., doing business as PCI of Illinois (PCI), in December 2016, for PCIs commercial packaging services. Under the terms of the agreement, PCI will be responsible for, among other things, the packaging of certain of our products, tooling purchases and repair, analytical work, stability testing, auditing of suppliers and storage. We are responsible for supplying the product materials to PCI. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to submit rolling forecasts, some of which will be binding on us. We will compensate PCI for services rendered, based on an agreed upon fee schedule and subject to certain price adjustments. 
 The agreement has an initial term ending in September 2019, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. The agreement will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreement at least one year prior to the end of the then current term. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 During 2017, we established the balance of our commercial team to launch INGREZZA in TD. This commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. 
 We have built a specialty sales force in the United States of approximately 160 experienced sales professionals. This specialty sales force focuses on promotion to physicians who treat TD patients, primarily neurologists and psychiatrists. 
 In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our business activities, which include the manufacture and marketing of INGREZZA as well as our other potential products currently in research and development, are subject to extensive regulation by the United States and other countries. Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the United States, various federal and state statutes and regulation also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, and record-keeping of human therapeutic products and their marketing. Recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding product tracking and tracing. 
 In addition, federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, 
 
16 


  lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and the federal civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, requires certain types of individuals and entities to abide by standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

 Preclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND application before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three-phase process. 
 

Phase I | Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacological properties of the product in human volunteers. 
Phase II | Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. 
Phase III | Large-scale, multi-center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA to market a product candidate for a specific disease.

 The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. To date, we have also conducted some of our clinical trials in Europe, Canada, Oceania and South Africa. Clinical trials conducted in foreign countries are also subject to oversight by regulatory authorities in those countries. 
 Once Phase III trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of an NDA or a biologics license application for approval to commence commercial sales. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 
18 


 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 We will also have to complete an approval process similar to that in the United States in virtually every foreign target market for our products in order to commercialize our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States. The resulting prices may not be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our corporate collaborators. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an 
 
19 


  application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 
20 


 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products. 
 In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our products or product candidates, including INGREZZA, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The marketability of any product or product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we 
 
21 


  expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extension of a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payor. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders 
 
22 


  and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the newly enacted federal income tax law includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015(MACRA), which will be fully implemented in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, government agencies and academic institutions. Competition may also arise from, among other things: 

 | other drug development technologies;
--+-------------------------------------


 | methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Developments by others may render our products, product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We are performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several disorders including endometriosis, TD, uterine fibroids, Tourette syndrome, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, essential tremor, pain, and other neurological and endocrine-related diseases and disorders. 
 In April 2017, INGREZZA (valbenazine), was approved by the FDA for TD, and is also currently in Phase IIb development for Tourette syndrome. There are currently two FDA approved drug therapies for TD; INGREZZA® and AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine), a deuterium labeled VMAT2 inhibitor which was developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva). In addition, off-label treatment regimens for TD consist of utilizing various atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), benzodiazepines (off-label) or botulinum toxin injections to treat the movements associated with TD. 
 
23 


 Generic neuroleptic medications (pimozide and haloperidol) as well as ABILIFY® (apriprizole) are approved by the FDA to control the tics associated with Tourette syndrome. Teva is also investigating AUSTEDO for utility in Tourette syndrome. Other potential indications for our VMAT2 inhibitor include the chorea associated with Huntingtons disease, schizophrenia and tardive dystonia. Currently, Austedo (deutetrabenazine) and XENAZINE® (tetrabenazine), marketed by Lundbeck, as well as its generic alternatives to Xenazine, are approved for the chorea associated with Huntingtons disease. 
 We, in conjunction with our partner AbbVie, are developing elagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. There are no current pharmaceutical therapies approved in the United States for the chronic treatment of uterine fibroids. During 2017, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed an NDA with the FDA for potential use of ESMYA® (ulipristal), a selective progesterone receptor modulator in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. ObsEva SA has initiated a Phase IIb endometriosis study with its GnRH receptor antagonist OBE2109 and has initiated Phase III studies of uterine fibroids patients with the same molecule. Myovant Sciences, Inc. is investigating its GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix, in Phase III trials of endometriosis, uterine fibroids and prostate cancer patients. LUPRON DEPOT®, marketed by AbbVie, is approved for short-term use to improve the outcome of uterine fibroid surgery. However, approximately 250,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the United States as a direct result of uterine fibroids, as well as myomectomies (surgery) to remove the fibroids. Our oral small molecule pharmaceutical agent, elagolix, would compete directly with these current invasive standards of care. 
 LUPRON DEPOT and SYNAREL® and depo-subQ provera104®, marketed by Pfizer, are products that have been approved for the treatment of endometriosis, infertility, and central precocious puberty. These drugs, and any generic alternatives, may compete with any small molecule non-peptide GnRH antagonists we, in conjunction with our collaborative partner AbbVie, develop for these indications. Approximately 130,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the United States as a direct result of endometriosis, as well as a significant number of laparoscopic procedures to ablate endometrial explants. Our oral small molecule pharmaceutical agent, elagolix, would also compete directly with these current invasive standards of care. 
 Opicapone is a COMT inhibitor to be utilized as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Parkinsons disease. COMT inhibitors prolong the duration of effect of levodopa which is the primary treatment option for Parkinsons disease patients. There are currently two FDA approved COMT inhibitors, COMTAN® (entacapone) originally developed by Orion Pharma and TASMAR® (tolcapone) originally developed by Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. Opicapone would compete directly with these two drugs and their generic equivalents. 
 NBI-74788 is currently being investigated for the treatment of classic CAH, for which there are limited therapies. High doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive ACTH levels. However, the level of dose as well as the duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushings syndrome as common and serious side effects. Both Millendo Therapeutics, with its ACAT1 inhibitor ATR-101, and Spruce Biosciences, with its CRF antagonist SPR001 are in clinical development for classic CAH. 
 If one or more of these competitive products or programs are successful, it may reduce or eliminate the market for our products. 
 Compared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater: 
 

 | capital resources;
--+-------------------


 | commercial experience;
--+-----------------------


 | research and development resources, including personnel and technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulatory experience;
--+-----------------------

 
24 


 
 | preclinical study and clinical testing experience;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | manufacturing and marketing experience; and
--+--------------------------------------------


 | production facilities.
--+-----------------------

 Any of these competitive factors could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which could negatively affect our stock price. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 400 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. In addition, we rely on a number of consultants to assist us. 
Insurance 
 We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. Upon FDA approval of INGREZZA we expanded our insurance coverage to include product liability insurance related to the sale of INGREZZA in the amount of $20 million per occurrence and $20 million in the aggregate. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
