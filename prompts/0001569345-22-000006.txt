Who We Are 
Sprinklr empowers the world’s largest and most loved brands to make their customers happier. 
We do this with a new category of enterprise software – Unified Customer Experience Management (“Unified-CXM”) – that enables every customer-facing function across the front office, from Customer Care to Marketing, to collaborate across internal silos, communicate across digital channels, and leverage a complete suite of modern capabilities to deliver better, more human customer experiences at scale – all on one unified, AI-powered platform.
Overview
The way the world communicates has changed, driven by a shift from traditional channels, like email and phone, to an ever-expanding universe of modern channels, like messaging, chat, text, and social, used by more than 4.6 billion people every day. Customer expectations have changed, too – reset by digital-first brands like Amazon, Uber and Airbnb. 
Connected, empowered, and with more choices than ever before, today’s consumers expect to be listened to, known, and served – not as data points, but as people – on demand, and on the channels they prefer. They advocate and criticize on public platforms, with nearly unlimited reach, where a single comment or review can make or break a brand’s reputation. How consumers choose to apply their newfound influence and who they decide to do business with are the result of one thing: their experience – a feeling shaped by every interaction they have with a brand. 
Today, companies compete primarily on the basis of customer experience. To do so, they must communicate instantly with consumers who move fluidly across dozens of channels and resolve customer pain-points in a personalized way. For large enterprises, meeting these expectations is a challenging new reality. 
As enterprises scale, they become increasingly siloed. Different customer-facing departments and lines of business emerge, each with their own fragmented view of the customer, often stored in a customer relationship management (“CRM”) system. These legacy systems are limited by a narrow set of structured, backward-looking customer information like names and addresses. CRM systems ignore the massive amounts of unstructured, real-time data that customers expect to inform their experiences – the truly important, contextual and human insights customers share freely about themselves and their preferences. 
This is why we founded Sprinklr: a software platform purpose-built to help enterprises break down information silos across the customer journey, tap into an ocean of unstructured digital data, and utilize AI to create a persistent, unified view of each customer – at scale. We do this by providing every customer-facing team with the modern capabilities they need to serve modern customers and enabling the entire front office to work together and deliver a more unified customer experience. For more than a decade, we have helped hundreds of the world’s most valuable and iconic brands rise to the challenge of making their customers happier, while helping them increase revenue, reduce costs, and mitigate brand reputation risks. 
We estimate the total addressable market for our Unified-CXM platform to be in excess of $60 billion as of January 31, 2022, based on industry data and our analysis of sales to our existing customers. We believe that global enterprises are only beginning to understand the power of using a unified technology platform to manage their customer experience across customer-facing functions, and as a result, we expect our market opportunity to expand. 
Our effective go-to-market strategy has enabled us to grow rapidly, attracting 1,166 customers, including more than two-thirds of the Fortune 100. As of January 31, 2022, we had 82 customers with subscription revenue equal to or greater than $1.0 million for the trailing 12-month period. Our customers include global enterprises across a broad array of industries and geographies, as well as marketing agencies and government departments along with non-profit and educational institutions. Our customers are located in more than 60 countries and use our platform in more than 100 languages. We see significant opportunity to grow within our existing customer base as our customers increase usage of existing products and/or add additional products. 
Our success and innovation is driven by a world-class management team and extraordinary culture. That culture is defined by both the “The Sprinklr Way,” which provides our framework for leadership, behaviors, and values, and the deep and genuine way we care about the success of our customers and employees. The Sprinklr Way enables us to attract and retain a diverse and talented team to provide a premium experience for our customers.

Our Artificial Intelligence
The core of our technology is our proprietary AI engine, which has a highly scalable and flexible architecture purpose-built for large enterprises. We believe that our platform is the first ever purpose-built customer experience AI engine. 
We have spent nearly a decade developing sophisticated, deep machine learning algorithms that automate techniques to predict consumer intent and sentiment in real-time. At any given instance, our AI engine can process millions of unstructured and structured data points ingested from myriads of channels and software applications.
Our AI engine is differentiated in the following ways: 
•A massive data ocean of consumer behavior and preferences: Our platform ingests, processes and analyzes consumer data and behavior from one of the largest publicly available datasets, with over 500 million data points accessed and ingested daily. Our AI deep machine learning algorithms work via eight distinct and powerful layers, which aggregate all different unstructured data types across more than 30 digital channels and convert them into actionable structured insights.
•Industry leading purpose-built Unified-CXM platform to ingest and analyze customer engagement data across all addressable/available channels: Our platform is architected to ingest unstructured and structured data from more than 30 digital channels in real-time, including audio, video and images. The same components are reused between multiple training, and inference pipelines, enabling our data scientists to build and deploy new use-cases rapidly.
•High accuracy of predicting consumer behavior and preferences: Our AI engine is built on top of highly sophisticated and customizable machine learning algorithms that result in more than 10 billion predictions per day. This fully automated AI engine provides actionable insights built on deep machine learning that requires no human involvement and is able to make predictions with a high degree of accuracy across a wide range of products offered by our Unified-CXM platform. 
•Powerful natural language processing and generation: We have developed advanced text analytics capabilities with technology that can look at the context, grammar and co-references of a sentence to associate opinions, thoughts, preferences and feedback with respective brands and products. We also model end-to-end dialogues for improving customer care agent productivity. This capability automatically learns from previous agent-consumer interactions, sentiment, emotion, intents and conversation intent journeys to suggest highly contextual, fluent, relevant and engaging responses. 
•Highly sophisticated and configurable AI models: We have developed highly specialized AI models across more than 60 industry verticals and sub-verticals across more than 100 languages. With a training data set of over 100 million data points, we are able to power more than 1,250 pre-built and custom-built AI models with very high accuracy. We deploy AI models at three different levels to ensure quick deployment for rapid time to value realization: (1) Global Models: Developed with data across industries and partners; (2) Industry Models: Developed when data of one industry varies significantly from another; and (3) Customized AI Models: Enabling brands to quickly customize AI models to solve their diverse set of use cases. 
Sprinklr AI gets smarter everyday by leveraging virtuous feedback loops enabled for all of our AI solutions. With each feedback that is fed back into Sprinklr algorithms, our AI models learn actively, which in turn leads to more customers adopting the power of Sprinklr’s AI capabilities. Our AI is used across Sprinklr’s use cases and products, which enables a cohesive customer experience. As AI and machine learning grow across industries, the flywheel approach has become a cornerstone and competitive differentiator at Sprinklr. 
Our Products
With the rise of modern channels, customers are connected and empowered like never before. Every part of the front office needs to think differently as a result:
•Customers volunteer feedback 24/7 on public channels – research can be actionable and real-time.
•How you care for customers determines what they say about you – care is the new marketing.
•Customers trust each other more than brands and want to be recognized as people, not purchasers – marketing is what they say, not what you say, so be personal.
•Customers buy based on their experience with a brand – engagement drives sales.
These new realities guide each of the modern products that we have built, providing solutions and capabilities that large enterprises can no longer afford to live without:

Our Growth Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our massive and growing market opportunity by executing on the following key elements to our growth strategy:
•Innovate to extend our technology leadership and AI-enabled product lines. We have a strong history of innovation. From 2010 to 2017 we expanded our platform from Social Engagement & Sales to include Modern Research, Modern Marketing & Advertising and Modern Care. Given our unified and scalable architecture we have the ability to build our platform to address new channels in a short period of time. 

•Grow customer base. As of January 31, 2022, we had a customer base of 1,166 organizations. We believe that this represents only a small fraction of our total addressable customer base. As we expand our product offerings and extend our technology leadership, we also plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base. 
•Increase revenue from existing customers. The mission-critical nature of our platform and enterprise-wide applicability drives adoption within additional divisions of enterprises and the cross-sale of more products. We believe that enterprises that use multiple products from our platform are able to achieve even higher returns on investment than those that do not and we believe that we have a significant opportunity to cross-sell and up-sell our various product offerings. 
•Further expansion internationally. During the year ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated 36% and 34%, respectively, of our revenue outside the Americas. We foresee a significant opportunity to further expand the use of our platform in other regions globally. 
•Broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem. Our partner ecosystem extends our geographic coverage, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, promotes thought leadership and provides complementary implementation resources. We work with agencies and partners such as Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, SAP, ServiceNow, Adobe, Oracle and others in these capacities. 
•Selectively pursue acquisitions. We have a history of selective acquisitions that increase the breadth of our offerings and markets. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that would allow us to accelerate the pace of our innovation while broadening our customer reach. 
Our Go-To-Market Strategy 
We generate sales, primarily, through a direct sales organization, which includes Sales Development Reps, Account Executives, Solutions Consultants, and Customer & Product Success personnel who are organized by geography and three customer groups: Global Strategic Accounts, Large Enterprise Accounts and Enterprise Accounts. 

We have a highly methodical and value-based approach to Sales and Customer Success, and have made significant investments in sales enablement, onboarding and performance tracking to ensure an effective, predictable and scalable sales model. Our customer-facing teams operate against a shared Customer Engagement process to ensure that the value we sold is realized by the customer, that they are fully consuming the product, and that there is a logical next step to value expansion. 
Our marketing efforts are focused on promoting our brand, generating awareness of our platform, supporting our community of customers, and creating sales leads. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including our participation in industry and partner conferences, digital marketing, case studies and customer testimonials. 
We also engage with industry research firms to educate them on our platform and its transformational impact on enterprises and have developed go-to-market partnerships that extend the reach of our platform such as Channels, GSIs and Agencies. We anticipate that we will continue to develop select third-party relationships to help grow our business. 
Partnerships 
The Sprinklr Global Alliance Program delivers training, go-to-market support, and a certification program to an ecosystem of technology organizations, systems integrators, agencies, and social media channels. Sprinklr’s partner program helps brands collaborate across marketing, sales, and care to meet the needs of the modern customer. Sprinklr’s average deal size is doubled when involving a strategic alliance partner. Many of our key partners are also customers of our Unified-CXM platform which is a benefit to our shared customers.

Services
We believe that technology, no matter how powerful or well designed, is only as good as the people and processes that complement it. Our foremost goal through our suite of professional services is to ensure that customers consistently find a return on investment and reach new levels of success as a business. We apply the right mix of advisory and hands-on support across people and process optimization to make sure customers are successful in their digital transformation journey.

Through our Implementation, Training and always-on Managed Services, we ensure that our customers realize value from Day 1 and throughout the Sprinklr journey. Our global, certified implementation consultants design, configure, educate and empower customers. Our teams provide a mix of virtual and instructor-led sessions to enable customers to become platform champions, while our Managed Services consultants are the long-term partners who help provide continuous platform optimization, consultancy and coaching to ensure that customers maximize the benefits of Sprinklr. 
Customer Success
At Sprinklr, realizing value for our customers is at the heart of everything we do. Our Customer Success team is a critical partner in achieving our customers’ business outcomes through Sprinklr. Sprinklr Customer Success has a formal and value-based delivery system that includes, among other processes: 
•The Day 0 Meeting is designed to confirm the value the key customer stakeholders are looking to achieve as the account transitions from the pre-sales to the post sales motion. The meeting confirms the use cases that support the value, the metrics associated to those use cases, and locks in commitment from the stakeholders on the deployment and the customer’s Success Engagement Process.
•The VRCI (Value Realization Check In) is designed to be a regular touch base, bi-weekly or as appropriate, in which we, collaboratively, identify and coordinate issue resolution; measure value realized to date through embedded use-case-based, value realization dashboards; and continually align the Sprinklr platform with our customers’ desired business outcomes and priorities. 
•The EBR (Executive Business Review) is designed to be a more strategic meeting with executive representation on both sides, where alignment is discussed, along with a roadmap, and corporate and strategic objectives. These are done at an appropriate cadence to ensure that at no point is there a question as to the business value Sprinklr is bringing. We collaboratively work with our customers to ensure that targets are hit and recommendations are discussed on how to excel, based on best practices and industry expertise. 
•The CHI (Customer Happiness Index) is a core internal metric for success at Sprinklr. Much like our Employee Happiness Index and Product Happiness Index, we continuously survey and monitor a simple metric of customer happiness on a scale of 1-10. This informal survey serves as an opportunity for continued engagement with our customers, but not a formal measure of our ongoing performance. 
•The CDAP (Customer Delight Assurance Program) applies when our strategic customers’ CHI falls, or consumption begins to trend downward. Through this process we have an executive review, escalate support and provide product focus to ensure customer retention and satisfaction. 
Competition
CXM is a rapidly developing, fragmented and competitive category of enterprise software. We believe that we are the only platform that completely addresses the complex Unified-CXM needs of enterprise-scale organizations. Certain features of our platform, however, compete in various segments of the overall experience management market. Our competitors, including, but not limited to, HubSpot, Qualtrics, Sprout Social, LivePerson, and Zendesk, mainly consist of consumer-grade point solutions in the following categories: 
•experience management solutions, including social media management solutions; 
•home-grown solutions and tools; 
•adjacent CXM solutions such as social messaging; 
•customer care and support solutions; 
•traditional marketing, advertising and consulting firms; and 
•CRM and ERP solutions. 
We expect competition as industry trends continue to favor the adoption of modern channels and the digital transformation of CXM. The key differentiators for CXM offerings include: 
•product features, quality, functionality and design; 
•AI capabilities; 
•strength of product vision and rapidity of innovation; 
•strong ecosystem of third-party integrations; 
•accessibility across several devices, operating systems and applications; 
•ease of use;
•overall platform experience; 
•governance, security and privacy; 
•return on investment and scalable pricing; 
•corporate reputation and awareness of our brand; 
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; 
•proven track record of execution and business value realization at enterprise scale; and 
•strength of post-sale support and customer success. 
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all these factors. However, we realize that many competitors may have competitive advantages over us, including greater brand recognition and name, longer operating histories, greater market penetration in adjacent industries, larger and more established customer bases, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, and access to significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources. Due to the rapid pace of development of our market, it is possible that new entrants with competitive solutions and substantial resources could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and more acutely meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers. The market in which we participate is new and rapidly evolving, and if we do not compete effectively, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand, by relying on a combination of federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as on contractual measures. However, these laws, agreements and procedures provide only limited protection. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform and solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. 
As of January 31, 2022, we owned 30 issued U.S. patents and 15 pending or provisional U.S. patent applications. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and solution names, taglines and logos in the United States and certain other jurisdictions to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in certain unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as Sprinklr.com, and similar variations. We have also registered “Sprinklr” as a trademark in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. 
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent unauthorized parties from obtaining, copying, accessing, using or reverse engineering our software, technology and other proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks relating to intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in the United States and internationally, including laws regarding data privacy, protection, security, retention, consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages (and related traffic data where applicable), intellectual property, human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, import and export controls, immigration laws, federal securities laws and tax regulations, all of which are continuously evolving and developing. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied to 
SaaS businesses, whether they apply to us at all, and how they may relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, often are unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business and the nature of our services and operations, including with respect to such topics as data privacy, security and protection, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
In addition, regulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, spam, data storage, data protection, data collection, content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal data and private data, and other matters that may be applicable to our business. More countries are enacting and enforcing laws related to the appropriateness of content and enforcing those and other laws by blocking access to services that are found to be out of compliance. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves, as an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and as our solutions are used in a greater number of countries and by additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.

Human Capital Management
As of January 31, 2022, we had 3,245 employees. Of these employees, 933 are based in the United States and 2,312 are based internationally, including 1,580 in India. We have a significant percentage of our development talent based in India and have had a very strong presence in India for the last decade. We believe this is a competitive advantage for us as we have access to a strong and deep bench of talent at a significant cost advantage to comparable talent elsewhere in the world. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Our Culture
Building a culture where everyone is happier and can thrive personally and professionally at Sprinklr is the cornerstone of our philosophy.
We create an environment of happier employees by building a values-based culture with rich communications, manager and employee action planning, competitive pay and benefits, and a culture where all employees feels like they belong and are valued. We recruit, retain and invest in the development of the best talent in the world.
A strong culture is a barometer of business success and we have developed a deliberate culture based on our roadmap that we have named “The Sprinklr Way” — our way of working, living and being. All employees are introduced to The Sprinklr Way by our CEO on their first day of orientation, known as our “Splash” session. The Sprinklr Way provides the framework for leadership, behaviors and values, and is composed of our Cultural Aspiration; Core Beliefs; Core Values; Leadership Expectations and Operating Principles. 
In addition to the Sprinklr Way, the company invests and focuses on the following initiatives that build trust and happiness across all regions:
•Employee Delight Assurance Program (EDAP): EDAP is part of our company operating rhythm and consists of the following three components: Goals Planning process; Employee Happiness Index; and Learn2Grow plans. Through this quarterly process, managers invest in thoughtful 1:1 meeting time with their direct reports to ensure alignment and progress to goals and priorities (called W2HMO); engage in rich discussion on how managers and direct reports can work together on three priorities to increase individual happiness (and record the score on a happiness scale of 1-10); and develop and implement a personal learning plan for each team member. Our 24-4-U program gives all employees a day away from the office to focus on the personal or professional development of their choice. The documented EDAP process has driven increased operational effectiveness, provided clearer understanding of accountabilities, and driven quarter-over-quarter improvements in employee happiness. These metrics used as part of EDAP serve as an opportunity for continued engagement with our employees, but not a formal measure to evaluate employee compensation.
•We Belong: At Sprinklr, our goal is to ensure that all employees feel like they belong and are operating in a judgment-free zone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, and lifestyle preference, among others. We value and celebrate our sense of belonging and fervently believe that every employee matters, and should be respected, listened to, and have opportunities to contribute to the magic of Sprinklr. We have taken action to support social justice and deliver training in diversity, inclusion and unconscious bias. “We Care” teams around the world encourage inclusivity and serve as resource groups for our employees. Approximately 33% of our employees are women, and women represent approximately 13% of our leadership team (vice president and above) and nearly 22% of our board of directors. Additionally, approximately 29% of our U.S. 
employees are racially or ethnically diverse and, in 2021, approximately 31% of our new hires were racially or ethnically diverse.
•Recognition: Our peer recognition program allows all employees to recognize a colleague for living one or more aspects of The Sprinklr Way anytime they see the right behaviors in action. Hundreds of recognitions have been awarded around the world for everything from collaboration, to living our Core Values.
•Wellbeing: Our comprehensive Wellbeing program is another way we invest in our employees, designed to keep our employees rejuvenated and happy throughout their career journey at Sprinklr. A special certification program advances their proficiency in important areas like mindfulness and relaxation. Our interactive Wellbeing platform offers captivating opportunities to participate in a range of healthy eating, mental, financial and physical challenges — all on the way to each of us becoming our healthiest self.
•Giving Back: Our employees around the world have a deep and passionate sense of community and give back in extraordinary ways. Our giving initiatives — under the umbrella of “Sprinklr Cares” — sponsor relief efforts around the world and give employees the opportunity to contribute to their personal causes. Among other benefits, Sprinklr Cares enables charitable donations when employees recruit new talent and allows for organized volunteer opportunities. Our 24-4-Others program awards employees a day away from the office to give their time and expertise to meaningful organizations and to help those less fortunate.
•We have subscribed to the Pledge 1% movement and from time to time may fund this commitment in a variety of ways, including issuing shares of our capital stock, which, in the aggregate, we do not expect to exceed 1% of our outstanding capital stock. If we determine to issue shares of our capital stock as part of our Pledge 1% donation, we may incur a non-cash expense in the quarter that we issue such shares equal to the fair value of the shares of our common stock issued. The pledge strengthens our social responsibility initiatives through inclusion efforts with community partners, empowering volunteerism, and support for nonprofits.
Compensation and Benefits
We consider a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee engagement, development, and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee safety and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with salaries and bonuses intended to be competitive for our industry and geographic locations, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust benefits package to promote well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we have conducted employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of future focus for our human capital practices and benefits offerings.
