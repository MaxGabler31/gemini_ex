ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
History and Development of Business
 
GEX Management, Inc. was originally formed in 2004 as Group Excellence Management, LLC. d/b/a MyEasyHQ. In March of 2016, it was converted from a limited liability company into a C corporation and changed its name to GEX Management, Inc. in April of 2016. GEX Management obtained its license to operate as a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), and established GEX Staffing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GEX Management, in March 2017 in order to begin distinguishing its staffing and PEO operations.
 
Carl Dorvil founded Group Excellence, LLC, a tutoring and mentoring company, from his dorm room at Southern Methodist University in 2004. Group Excellence provided tutoring and mentoring services to students with the goal of inspiring young persons to pursue high personal and academic achievement. The company quickly grew to more than six hundred employees. In 2011, Group Excellence was on Inc. 500’s annual list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in the United States.
 
In response to rapid growth, Mr. Dorvil developed GEX Management to facilitate the back-office functions of his company. GEX Management provided Group Excellence, LLC with human resources, IT, accounting/bookkeeping, social media, payroll, and conducted a majority of the overall operations of the company. Mr. Dorvil sold Group Excellence, LLC in 2011 but maintained ownership of GEX Management, which continued as a Professional Services Company providing back office support to the tutoring company, as well as third-party clients. In 2016 GEX Management revised its business model to provide staffing and back-office services to a wide variety of industries in order to expand the Company’s footprint, thereby building on the previous 12-year history of exceptional client service. On February 23, 2018, the US Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, mentioned at the “African American Leaders in the White House: Education, Business and Policy” that Dorvil was “the youngest African American CEO ever to take a company public in U.S. history.”

Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to become a leading business management and HR company, and to continuously expand our client base. We seek to achieve this objective by continuing to implement our business strategy, which includes the primary elements enumerated below.
 Marketing and Sales
 
Our comprehensive marketing efforts are fluid, adaptive, and results-driven. They comprise both traditional and non-traditional channels including print collateral, website, video, PowerPoint presentations, digital ads, social media posts and press releases. We likewise employ a small sales team. We strategically target small and mid-sized businesses that require the services we provide. Previously, a significant amount of corporate revenue has been derived through client referrals and management’s personal relationships. Our 2018 plan is to continue to leverage these important relationships while expanding our brand reach by means of integrated marketing campaigns, more timely, informative, and effectual messaging, and greater collaboration between marketing and sales in order to increase both client and sales growth.
Dependence on Major Customers
 
We rely heavily on the service contract renewals of our clients. Our management and client facing team members are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key clients. In 2017 we had 2 significant clients that comprised approximately 84% of our revenues and in 2016 we had 4 or 5 significant clients that made up approximately 80% of our revenues.

Industry and Competitors
 
The HR industry is highly fragmented, resulting in robust competition. Competition affects our success in both the market segments we currently serve, as well as the new market segments we may enter in the future. We compete with several large HR companies, as well as PEOs and Administrative Service Organizations (“ASO”) that provide identical services to those GEX Management provides; some offer additional services. The financial and marketing resources of some of our competitors exceed those of GEX Management. Businesses primarily select a service provider based on price point/value, innovative/flexible product offerings, and quality of customer service.
