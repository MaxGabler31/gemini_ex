1

our capabilities in specific training and technical service areas, expand our global presence, and increase our customer base and market sector reach.  As a result, we’ve added product sales training and leadership training, and strengthened our digital learning and content development expertise, while also expanding further internationally. Our acquisitions have also expanded our market sector reach, added new customers and enhanced our service offerings through the addition of new complementary services. We also invested in global expansion through the establishment of over a dozen new subsidiaries in select countries since 2013 to support new global outsourcing contracts. We believe our expanded infrastructure and the ability to deliver globally will allow us to better support our existing client base as well as win new business for our comprehensive service offerings. 

Operating Segments

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we operated through two reportable business segments: (i) Workforce Excellence and (ii) Business Transformation Services. In December 2017, we announced a new organizational structure and plan to improve operating results by increasing organic growth and reducing operating costs. Effective January 1, 2018, we re-organized into two operating segments aligned by complementary service lines and supported by a new business development organization aligned by industry sector. The Workforce Excellence segment includes the majority of the former Learning Solutions and Professional & Technical Services segments. The Business Transformation Services segment includes the majority of the former Performance Readiness Solutions and Sandy Training & Marketing segments. Certain business units transferred between the former operating segments to better align with the service offerings of the two new segments. In addition, effective July 1, 2018, we transferred the management responsibility of certain additional business units between the two operating segments primarily to consolidate our non-technical content design and development businesses into one global digital learning strategies and solutions service line. We have reclassified the segment financial information herein for the prior year periods to reflect the changes in our segments and conform to the current year's presentation. 
Each of our two reportable segments represents an operating segment under ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level, or one level below an operating segment, under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. In connection with the new organizational structure that went into effect on January 1, 2018, we determined that we have four reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, which represent our four practices which are one level below the operating segments, as discussed below.
Our two segments each consist of two global practice areas which are focused on providing similar and/or complementary products and services across our diverse customer base and within targeted markets. Within each practice are various service lines having specific areas of expertise. Marketing and communications, sales, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, information systems and other administrative services are organized at the corporate level. Business development and sales resources are aligned by industry sector to support existing customer accounts and new customer development across both segments. Further information regarding our business segments is discussed below.

Competitive Strengths

We believe our key competitive strengths include:

Global Delivery and Single-Source Custom Training Solutions Provider. We believe we are one of the largest independent single-source custom training solutions providers with the capability of delivering on a global basis in the markets in which we compete. We provide managed learning services solutions spanning the full life-cycle of the training process, including the management of training departments and administrative processes for our customers. We believe that the breadth of our service and product offerings, which encompass fully integrated managed learning services solutions as well as discrete services, allows us to better serve the needs of our clients by providing them with a single-source solution for custom training, consulting and technical and engineering services. We believe that the integration of our services into a single platform, together with our global presence and delivery capabilities, allows our customers to leverage an enterprise-wide solution to address their performance improvement needs in a way that streamlines their internal operations, improves the speed and efficiency at which critical know-how is disseminated on a firm-wide basis, and enables them to achieve their desired performance improvement goals.

Outstanding Reputation in the Industry. We have continued to build an outstanding reputation in the training industry through the delivery of our training solutions and have received numerous awards. In 2018, for the fifteenth consecutive year, Training Industry, Inc., an industry trade organization, selected us as one of the Top 20 Companies in Training Outsourcing, and for the eleventh consecutive year selected us as one of the Top Sales Training Companies. During 2018, Training Industry, Inc. also selected us as a Top 20 Learning Portal Company, Top 20 Leadership Training Company, Top 20 IT Training Company, Top 20 Gamification, Top 20 Assessment & Evaluation Company, Top 20 Content Development Company and a Top 20 Health & Safety Training Company. We also won other industry awards including twelve Brandon Hall Excellence in Learning Awards and four Chief Learning Officer Magazine awards, including one for Excellence Business Impact and Excellence in Business Partnership.

Scalable Technology Platform. Our training programs are delivered both online and in classroom settings. We have the ability to work with outside information technology (IT) vendors in combination with our own proprietary software in order to deliver a scalable technology platform capable of addressing training needs of various size and commitment, ranging from a one-time project to a multi-year training program.

Legacy Technical Expertise. In the 1960’s, we began providing technical services to the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine program and the nuclear electric-power generation industry, and have since maintained and expanded our reputation for providing technically complex consulting, engineering, and training services. Many of our employees have engineering degrees, technical training or years of relevant technical industry experience. Through repeat projects with industry leaders we have acquired significant industry experience in providing highly technical consulting services. We believe that our technical expertise allows us to address market opportunities for complex business challenges that require in-depth expertise and certifications typically acquired over several years of specialized training and many years of experience. We also believe that our ability to provide both training-related and business consulting services allows us to gain insight into operations of our customers, understand the challenges they face and develop optimal solutions to meet these challenges. In addition, we believe that the knowledge that we develop while working with our clients provides us with a significant competitive advantage as those clients look to expand the scope of services outsourced to third party service providers.

Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Large Product Sales Training Market. We believe that the introduction of new products with advanced features, combined with the growing amount and accessibility of information available to consumers, requires companies to maintain a highly skilled and technologically current sales force to effectively capture customer interest and confidence. In-house implementation of product sales training programs can be expensive and time-consuming as these programs typically involve significant levels of face-to-face training, in some cases across a large global sales force. In addition, product sales training tends to be a continuous process, as the pace of new products and features in many cases requires year-round updating of the sales force. We believe we have one of the industry’s leading product sales training platforms, and are well positioned to benefit from increased training outsourcing as companies look for ways to reduce costs. 

Highly Qualified and Dedicated Employees and Tenured Management Team. Our most important asset is our people, as their wide-ranging skill sets enable us to serve our diverse and expanding global client base. As a result, we are committed to the continued development of our employees. We offer our employees technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees’ commitment to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork. We also benefit from the skill and experience of our executive management team, who together have in excess of 100 years of experience in the training industry and have an average tenure with our company of over 20 years.

Contracts

We currently perform under fixed price (including fixed-fee per transaction), time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable contracts. 
The following table illustrates the percentage of our total revenue attributable to each type of contract for the year ended December 31, 2018:

Fixed fee per transaction | 47 | %
Fixed price | 19 | 
Time-and-materials, including fixed rate | 29 | 
Cost-reimbursable | 5 | 
Total revenue | 100 | %


Fixed price contracts (including fixed-fee per transaction) provide for payment to us of pre-determined amounts as compensation for the delivery of specific products or services, without regard to the actual costs incurred. We bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs required to perform the specified services may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain a loss, but we have the opportunity to derive increased profit if the costs required to perform the specified services are less than expected. Fixed price contracts generally permit the client to terminate the contract on written notice; in the event of such termination we would typically be paid a proportionate amount of the fixed price.

Time-and-materials contracts generally provide for billing of services based upon the hourly billing rates of the employees performing the services and the actual expenses incurred multiplied by a specified mark-up factor up to a certain aggregate dollar amount. Our time-and-materials contracts include certain contracts under which we have agreed to provide training, engineering and technical services at fixed hourly rates. Time-and-materials contracts generally permit the client to control the amount, type and timing of the services to be performed by us and to terminate the contract on written notice. If a contract is terminated, we are typically paid for the services we have provided through the date of termination.

Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for us to be reimbursed for our actual direct and indirect costs plus a fee. These contracts also are generally subject to termination at the convenience of the client. If a contract is terminated, we are typically reimbursed for our costs through the date of termination, plus the cost of an orderly termination, and paid a proportionate amount of the fee.

International

We conduct our business globally and outside the United States primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries. We may continue to create new subsidiaries as our business expands. Through these subsidiaries, we are capable of providing substantially the same services and products as are available to clients in the United States, although modified as appropriate to address the language, business practices and cultural factors unique to each client and country. In combination with our subsidiaries, we are able to coordinate the delivery to multi-national clients of services and products that achieve consistency on a global, enterprise-wide basis.  Revenue from operations outside the United States represented approximately 33% and 31% of our consolidated revenue 
6

for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Note 13 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).

Customers

During 2018, we provided services to over 500 customers. Significant customers include multinational automotive manufacturers, such as General Motors Company, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Ford Motor Company and Fiat North America LLC; financial services companies such as HSBC, Bank of America, SunTrust Banks and PNC Bank; governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Skills Funding Agency in the United Kingdom; U.S. Government prime contractors, such as Bechtel National, Inc. and URS Corporation; commercial electric power utilities, such as Eskom, Entergy and National Grid; pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co. and Pfizer; and other large multinational companies, such as Microsoft, CIGNA Corporation, Rockwell Automation, Network Appliance, Cisco Systems, Inc., Texas Instruments, Lowe’s Companies, Inc., General Electric and United Technologies Corporation. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we provided services to 145 customers in the Fortune 500 and 123 customers in the Global Fortune 500.
We have a market concentration of revenue in both the automotive sector and the financial & insurance sector. Revenue from the automotive industry accounted for approximately 23%, 22% and 22% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single automotive customer, which accounted for approximately 14% and 13% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 accounts receivable from a single automotive customer totaled $19.9 million, or 18% of our consolidated accounts receivable balance. Revenue from the financial & insurance industry accounted for approximately 19%, 20% and 21% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single financial services customer, which accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, billed and unbilled accounts receivable from a single financial services customer totaled $21.2 million, or 11%, of our consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 or consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018.
We believe the nature of our business, which includes established relationships with our clients, provides us with a platform from which to drive revenues and gives us visibility into our future performance. We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, with over 90% of our top 25 clients having used our services for five or more years. Additionally, over 90% of our annual revenue is generated from client relationships that existed in the prior year. We also had a backlog for services under executed contracts of $318.0 million as of December 31, 2018, most of which we anticipate will be recognized as revenue during 2019. In addition, we received $9.5 million of additional funding subsequent to December 31, 2018 for executed contracts which were pending at year-end and not included in the reported backlog as of December 31, 2018. We anticipate that most of our backlog as of December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenue during 2019.
Employees

Our principal resource is our personnel. As of December 31, 2018, we had 4,689 employees. We also utilize additional adjunct instructors and consultants as needed. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to continue to attract, retain and integrate into our operations instructors, engineers, technical personnel and consultants who possess the skills and experience required to meet the needs of our clients.

We utilize a variety of methods to attract and retain personnel. We believe that the compensation and benefits offered to our employees are competitive with the compensation and benefits available from other organizations with which we compete for personnel. In addition, we encourage the professional development of our employees, both internally via GP University (our own internal training resource) and through third parties, and we also offer tuition reimbursement for job-related educational costs. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Competition

We face a highly competitive environment. The principal competitive factors are the experience and capability of service personnel, performance, quality and functionality of products, reputation and price. The training industry is large, highly fragmented and competitive, with low barriers to entry and no single competitor accounting for a significant market share. According to Training Magazine’s 2018 Training Industry Report, U.S. training expenditures totaled approximately $90 billion in 2018, including payroll 
7

and spending on external products and services. Our competitors include several large publicly traded and privately held companies, vocational and technical training schools, degree-granting colleges and universities, continuing education programs and thousands of small privately held training providers and individuals. In addition, many of our clients maintain internal training departments, which have the resources and ability to provide the same or similar services in-house. Some of our competitors offer services and products at lower prices, and some competitors have significantly greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing and other resources. Moreover, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the training and performance improvement market due, in part, to the evolving nature of the market and the relatively low barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that we will be successful against such competition.

Engineering and consulting services such as those that we provide are performed by many of the customers themselves, large architectural and engineering firms that have expanded their range of services beyond design and construction activities, large consulting firms, information technology companies, major suppliers of equipment and individuals and independent service companies similar to us. The engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel.  Many of our competitors for our engineering and technical consulting services have greater financial resources than we do.  Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Sales & Marketing

In 2018, sales, marketing and proposal resources were centralized to better position ourselves to achieve the growth goals of the organization. We operate as an integrated, customer-centric team to ensure our go-to-customer strategy directly supports the business strategy.  We use our online digital presence, attendance at trade shows, presentations at industry and trade association conferences, press releases, industry award submissions, webinars and workshops given by our personnel to serve important marketing functions. We also carry out selective print and digital advertising and conduct targeted marketing campaigns to current and prospective clients. In addition, we use our social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SlideShare and a Company blog on our website, as a means of sharing thought leadership content, disclosing information about the Company, our services and other topics important to our clients.  By staying ahead of the market trends and engaging with clients, we are able to identify possible opportunities to expand the services we are providing them as well as extend the current services we are providing. In other cases, clients ask us to bid competitively. In both cases, we submit proposals to the client for evaluation. The period between submission of a proposal to final award can range from 30 days or less (generally for noncompetitive, short-term contracts), to a year or more (generally for large, competitive multi-year contracts).
Backlog

Our backlog for services under executed contracts and subcontracts was approximately $318.0 million and $268.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we received $9.5 million of additional funding subsequent to December 31, 2018 for executed contracts which were pending at year-end and not included in the reported backlog as of December 31, 2018. We anticipate that most of our backlog as of December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenue during 2019. However, the rate at which services are performed under certain contracts, and thus the rate at which backlog will be recognized, may be at the discretion of the client and most contracts are, as mentioned above, subject to termination by the client upon written notice.
