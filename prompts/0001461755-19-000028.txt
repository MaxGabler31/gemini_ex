CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
The following risks, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:

• | the cost savings from our exit of the Tennessee and northwest Georgia markets may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected;


• | the funding impact from the loss of deposits following the sale of our Tennessee and northwest Georgia branches;


• | our strategic decision to focus on the greater Atlanta market may not positively impact our financial condition in the expected timeframe, or at all;


• | costs associated with our growth initiatives in the Atlanta market area;


• | changes in asset quality and credit risk;


• | risks associated with increased geographic concentration, borrower concentration and concentration in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans resulting from our exit of the Tennessee and northwest Georgia markets;


• | the cost and availability of capital;


• | customer acceptance of our products and services;


• | customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices;


• | the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives;


• | the impact, extent, and timing of technological changes;


• | severe catastrophic events in our geographic area;


• | a weakening of the economies in which we conduct operations may adversely affect our operating results;


• | the U.S. legal and regulatory framework, including those associated with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), could adversely affect the operating results of the company;


• | the interest rate environment may compress margins and adversely affect net interest income;


• | changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental bodies and central banks could affect the economic environment in which we operate;


• | our ability to determine accurate values of certain assets and liabilities;


• | adverse developments in securities, public debt, and capital markets, including changes in market liquidity and volatility;


• | our ability to anticipate or respond to interest rate changes correctly and manage interest rate risk presented through unanticipated changes in our interest rate risk position and/or short- and long-term interest rates;


• | the impact of the transition from LIBOR and our ability to adequately manage such transition;


• | unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to our ability to enter the financial markets to manage and respond to any changes to our liquidity position;


• | adequacy of our risk management program;


• | increased competitive pressure due to consolidation in the financial services industry;


• | risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems;

Background
Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “Atlantic Capital,” or the “Company”), a Georgia corporation organized in 2006 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is the parent of Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”). We provide a competitive array of credit, treasury management, capital markets, electronic banking and deposit products and services through dedicated and experienced banking teams. 
In 2015, we acquired First Security Group, Inc. and FSG Bank, N.A. (“First Security”), a Tennessee-based financial institution with approximately $1.14 billion in assets. Since 2016, we have steadily refocused our efforts on key geographic markets, ultimately developing a strategy focused on Atlanta and the surrounding market areas as well as select national client segments. From 2016 to 2018, we completed the sale of eight branches and the consolidation of two additional branches in Tennessee, closed our loan production office in Charlotte, North Carolina, and sold our trust and wealth management division, which primarily operated in the Tennessee and northwest Georgia markets. During 2018, we decided to exit the Tennessee and northwest Georgia markets and the residential mortgage banking business, and on November 14, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell the remaining 11 branches in Tennessee and three branches in northwest Georgia to FirstBank (the “Branch Sale”). The Branch Sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019. We are currently in the process of opening a loan production office in Cobb County, Georgia, and have submitted applications to establish a branch in Atlanta’s Buckhead Community and to convert our Athens, Georgia loan production office to a branch. The new branches and the loan production office are expected to open in the second or third quarter of 2019.
Although we expect to incur expenses in connection with these transactions in the short term, we expect our recent strategic changes to have a positive impact on our financial results, including long-term cost savings, the reallocation of resources to the Atlanta market and in high-growth businesses, improved capital to support our strategic initiatives, and improved returns on average assets. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Business Strategy
Our objective is to build Atlantic Capital as Atlanta’s premier hometown business bank. 
We are a team of talented, experienced and entrepreneurial bankers focused on serving commercial and not-for-profit enterprises, commercial real estate developers and individual clients that value high-touch relationships and deep expertise. 
We believe our strengths differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to address the financial needs of our clients. We also believe that these clients will present us with opportunities to originate loans and utilize our treasury management expertise. We will continue to focus on maintaining industry diversity in our target client base in order to mitigate our loan portfolio risk, increase market presence and leverage the diverse industry experience of our corporate and business banking teams.
We recognize that the success of our franchise depends upon the success of our bankers. We are focused on hiring and retaining experienced bankers, providing them with the business development and client service tools they need to build and maintain long-term banking relationships through a deep understanding of each client’s business. We also construct client service teams with the range of expertise necessary to provide collaborative and seamless high-touch service across product lines. We are committed to continued investment through recruiting and employee development as well as product innovation, both in our core business of commercial and private banking and in high-growth businesses, including Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lending, franchise lending, payments and technology banking and treasury management. We continually evaluate our product offerings, and we rely heavily on input from our bankers as we refine our products to provide creative financial solutions tailored to the evolving needs of our clients.
To support our strategic initiatives, we focus on maintaining a balance sheet with strong capital levels and excellent credit quality, which we believe enable us to not only nimbly expand our teams of service providers as hiring opportunities arise, but also to originate larger loans, invest in specialty financing and other high-growth business lines, and attract deposits from high transaction volume payments and financial technology businesses. 
We continually evaluate the profitability and viability of our existing lines of business, the strategic advantages associated with investment in the organic development or acquisition of lines of business that better serve our core banking customers, and the termination of under-used or unprofitable lines of business.
Commercial and Not-for-Profit Banking
We offer a full range of commercial and business banking products to fund our Georgia-based clients’ strategic growth, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and strategic corporate finance activities. Our solutions include working capital and equipment loans, loans supported by owner-occupied real estate and strategic corporate financing funded through revolving lines of credit, term loans and letters of credit, as well as cash and treasury management services. 
2

We focus on banking commercial companies with revenues in excess of $10 million and small businesses with revenues of $1 million to $10 million based in Georgia. In addition, we offer SBA loans and franchise finance programs to small businesses and franchisees across a wide range of industries in the southeast and nationally through a dedicated team of bankers with expertise in these specialized forms of lending.
The terms of our commercial and not-for-profit enterprises and business banking loans vary by purpose and by the underlying collateral. The vast majority of these loans are secured by assets of the borrower; however, we periodically make unsecured loans to our most credit worthy clients when circumstances support such activity. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually fully-secured by accounts receivable and inventory, as well as by personal guarantees of the principals or owners of the business. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, the principal balance is repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash. For loans secured with other types of collateral, the principal balance generally amortizes over the term of the loan. The quality of the commercial borrower’s management and its ability to both properly evaluate and respond to changes affecting its business operations and operating environment are significant factors we evaluate with respect to a commercial borrower’s creditworthiness.
Specialty Corporate Financial Services
Through our highly experienced specialty corporate financial services team, we provide an array of specialty commercial lending, treasury management, payment processing, deposit, and capital markets services. 
Our specialty corporate financial services are tailored to the needs of clients in particular industries, such as payroll services, financial technology, financial services and banking. Our corporate treasury management services are designed to improve our clients’ financial efficiency by facilitating domestic and international collection and disbursement of funds and other transactions with real time online execution and reporting capabilities. Our electronic payments services are designed to assist high transaction volume clients with payment processing through the FedWire and Automated Clearing House (ACH) systems as well as transaction risk monitoring and management. We offer money market deposit accounts that allow financial institution clients to earn a higher return than that available on other short term investment or on balances at the Federal Reserve Bank. In addition, we offer capital markets services, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange transactions, designed to assist clients in managing financial risk exposure. 
Private Banking
Through our private banking business team, we offer personal credit products, an array of checking and savings products and online and mobile banking services.
Our private banking credit products include loans to individuals and professional services businesses for personal and investment purposes, such as secured installment and term loans and home equity lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is often primarily dependent upon the borrower’s financial profile and is more likely to be adversely affected by personal hardships as compared to other types of loans. Credit decisions are based on a review of a borrower’s credit and debt history, past income levels and cash flow to assess the ability of the borrower to make future payments. Home equity lines of credit are underwritten based upon our assessment of the borrower’s credit profile and ability to repay the entirety of the obligation.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Through our commercial real estate team, we offer a wide variety of loan products, including secured construction loans, secured mini‑permanent loans and, less frequently, secured or unsecured lines of credit. A large majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is secured by a first mortgage security interest in the property financed. Our primary focus is providing loans for our core commercial real estate property types: multifamily (primarily for-rent) housing, office, industrial and retail properties. We occasionally extend unsecured credit to public real estate investment trusts and to certain other commercial real estate clients, which we believe to have exceptional credit quality. The majority of our commercial real estate customers and the largest proportion of our commercial real estate collateral are located in the Atlanta area. We have occasionally extended credit to select clients in markets outside our primary markets, and expect to continue to do this in certain circumstances. In addition, we will retain select loans to borrowers with collateral located in the Tennessee and northwest Georgia markets following the Branch Sale.
The majority of our commercial real estate loans finance stabilized income producing assets of our borrowers. We also extend loans for construction and development purposes and lines of credit. We seek to actively manage and balance our commercial real estate loan portfolio across various property types and industries to assure appropriate diversification and to manage our exposure to market conditions. We have arranged and participated in syndicated commercial real estate loans to diversify and mitigate our client concentration risk and to support our loan growth goals, and we may continue both in the future.

Competition 
We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than we do. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and Internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.
The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance agency and underwriting, and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.
As of June 30, 2018, there were approximately 80 banks and thrifts operating in metropolitan Atlanta. Large national, super-regional and regional banks may lack the consistency of decision‑making authority and local focus necessary to provide superior service to our target clients. Conversely, smaller community banks typically lack the sophisticated products, capital and management experience to provide the level of service that our target clients demand. We believe that our product offerings are more robust than those offered by community banks and more tailored to suit our clients’ needs than those offered by large regional and national competitors. In addition, we believe that our collaborative team approach, the decision-making authority vested in our seasoned bankers and our streamlined credit approval process allow us to provide high-touch service at a level not offered by any of our competitors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 340 individuals (334 of whom were full-time equivalent employees). Most of our employees are only employees of the Bank. We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with employees to be good.

Supervision and Regulation
Bank holding companies and national banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect the Company and the Bank. This summary is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to their respective businesses. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders of the Company. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected by a statute or regulation. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s business and prospects.

Bank Holding Company Regulation and Structure
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”) and to the regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and thus is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC.
The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:

• | it may acquire substantially all of the assets of any other bank holding company, or direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any other bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the other bank holding company;


• | it may acquire substantially all of the assets of any other bank, or direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the bank;


• | it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or


• | it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or that would substantially lessen competition in the banking business, unless the public interest in meeting the needs of the communities to be served outweighs the anti-competitive effects. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues, which focuses, in part, on the performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”).
Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company. Control is also presumed to exist, although rebuttable, if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either:

• | the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; or


• | no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.

Our common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control.
The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in, or acquiring 5% or more of the voting stock of a company engaged in, activities other than banking; managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and performing servicing activities for subsidiaries; and engaging in any activities other than activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by order or regulation are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident included thereto under the BHCA. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve considers whether performing the activity can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or control of any subsidiary when the continuation of the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.
Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may file an election with the Federal Reserve to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities. The election must be accompanied by a certification that the Company’s insured depository institution subsidiary is “well capitalized” and “well managed.” Additionally, the CRA rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. The Company has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
We are required to act as a source of financial strength for the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company might not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans made by the Company to the Bank will be repaid only after the Bank’s deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full.
Bank Merger Act
Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, commonly known as the “Bank Merger Act,” requires the prior written approval of the OCC before any national bank may (i) merge or consolidate with, (ii) purchase or otherwise acquire the assets of, or (iii) assume the deposit liabilities of, another bank if the resulting institution is to be a national bank.
5

The Bank Merger Act prohibits the OCC from approving any proposed merger transaction that would result in a monopoly or would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the OCC from approving a proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to lessen competition substantially, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction whose effect would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the OCC finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
In every proposed merger transaction, the OCC must also consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and resulting institutions, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and the effectiveness of each insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money-laundering activities, including in overseas branches.
Capital Adequacy
The final rule adopted by the federal banking regulators in 2013 implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms established new prompt corrective action requirements for all banks and includes a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements under the final rule are set forth in the table that follows.

Requirement | Total Risk Based Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio | CET1 Risk Based Capital Ratio | Leverage Ratio
Well Capitalized | ≥ 10% | ≥ 8% | ≥ 6.5% | ≥ 5% 
Adequately Capitalized | ≥ 8% | ≥ 6% | ≥ 4.5% | ≥ 4% 
Undercapitalized | ≥ 8% | ≥ 6% | ≥ 4.5% | ≥ 4% 
Significantly Undercapitalized | ≥ 6% | ≥ 4% | ≥ 3% | ≥ 3% 
Critically Undercapitalized | Tangible equity to total assets ≤ 2 | | 

The final rule also sets forth a capital ratio phase-in schedule. The phase-in provisions for banks with $250 billion or less in total assets are set forth in the following table.

Effective as of January 1, | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 
Minimum Leverage Ratio | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% 
Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio | 4.5% | 4.5% | 4.5% | 4.5% 
Capital Conservation Buffer (1) | 0.625% | 1.25% | 1.875% | 2.5% 
Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio with Capital Conservation Buffer | 5.125% | 5.75% | 6.375% | 7.0% 
Minimum Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio | 6.0% | 6.0% | 6.0% | 6.0% 
Minimum Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio with Capital | | | | 
Conservation Buffer | 6.625% | 7.25% | 7.875% | 8.5% 
Minimum Total Risk Based Capital Ratio | 8.0% | 8.0% | 8.0% | 8.0% 
Minimum Total Risk Based Capital Ratio with Capital | | | | 
Conservation Buffer | 8.625% | 9.25% | 9.875% | 10.5%


(1) | The capital conservation buffer must be maintained in order for a banking organization to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

The final rule includes comprehensive guidance with respect to the measurement of risk-weighted assets. For residential mortgages, Basel III retains the risk-weights contained in the current capital rules which assign a risk-weight of 50% to most first-lien exposures and 100% to other residential mortgage exposures. The final rule increased the risk-weights associated with certain on-balance sheet assets, such as high volatility commercial real estate loans, and loans that are more than 90 days past due or in nonaccrual status. Capital requirements were also increased for certain off-balance sheet exposures including, for example, loan commitments with an original maturity of one year or less.
Under the final rule, certain banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, are permitted to make a one-time election to continue the current treatment of excluding from regulatory capital most accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) 
6

components, including amounts relating to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and amounts attributable to defined benefit post-retirement plans. Institutions that elect to exclude most AOCI components from regulatory capital under Basel III will be able to avoid volatility that would otherwise be caused by things such as the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities. The Company and the Bank elected to exclude AOCI components from regulatory capital under Basel III.
Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2018, federal banking agencies are required to develop a new Community Bank Leverage Ratio for banks with assets of less than $10 billion.  Banks that exceed this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements.  The federal banking agencies will be permitted to consider an institution’s risk profile in determining whether the institution qualifies as a “community bank” for purposes of this requirement.  The federal banking agencies have not developed the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.
Liquidity
In December 2010, the Basel Committee published “Basel III: International Framework for Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards and Monitoring” and in January 2013 published a revised liquidity coverage ratio (collectively referred to as the “Liquidity Standard”). The Liquidity Standard includes: (1) a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure that sufficient high quality liquid resources are available in case of a liquidity crisis; (2) a net stable funding ratio to promote liquidity resiliency over longer time horizons by creating incentives for banks to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis; and (3) additional liquidity monitoring metrics focused on maturity mismatch, concentration of funding and available unencumbered assets. The Liquidity Standard would be phased-in through 2019. On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final liquidity rule that establishes for the first time a standardized minimum liquidity requirement. The final rule applies to large and internationally active banking organizations and is not applicable to the Bank. The U.S. banking agencies have not adopted or proposed rules to implement a quantitative liquidity requirement for banks such as the Bank with less than $50 billion in total assets, and it is uncertain whether such a requirement will be established.
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC can impose substantial additional restrictions upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements as set forth above.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”) requires the federal regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements as set forth above. Generally, a receiver or conservator for a bank that is “critically undercapitalized” must be appointed within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed within 45 days of the date a bank is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for a bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by regulator, or (ii) the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the bank is notified that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for specified time periods. Additional measures with respect to undercapitalized institutions include a prohibition on capital distributions, growth limits and restrictions on activities.
An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had capital levels that qualify as “well capitalized” under such regulations. 
The FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable to regulators, the bank’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s total assets at the time it became “undercapitalized”; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
“Significantly undercapitalized” insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and the cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. A bank that is not “well capitalized” is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits.

For further detail on capital and capital ratios see the discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” section, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” contained in Item 7.
FDIC Insurance Assessments
The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), insures the deposits of the Bank up to prescribed limits for each depositor (currently, $250,000 per depositor). The assessment paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. The deposit insurance assessment is calculated on the average total consolidated assets of insured depository institutions during the assessment period, less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period as opposed to solely bank deposits at an institution. An institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC’s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. The Bank’s insurance assessments during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $745,000, $966,000, and $1.6 million, respectively.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
The FDIC also collects a deposit-based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the Financing Corporation (the “FICO”). The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by FICO in its capacity as a financing vehicle for the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation, which formerly insured savings and loan associations. These assessments will continue until the debt matures in 2019.
Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank. While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law governing the extent to which banks can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to holding companies, the principal source of cash revenues for the Company are dividends from the Bank. The relevant federal regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit a national bank or bank holding company from engaging in conduct that, in the opinion of such regulatory agency, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.
Insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations). In addition, capital rules limit capital distributions, including dividends, if the depository institution does not have a “capital conservation buffer.” See further details above under “Capital Adequacy.”
National banks are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC in order to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (1) such bank’s net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (2) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation).
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if one or more of the holding company’s bank subsidiaries are classified as undercapitalized.
A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should review their dividend policies, and has discouraged dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital levels are strong.

Transactions with Affiliates
Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve limit the types and amounts of these transactions (including extensions of credit from their bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that any “covered transactions” between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company be limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Further, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts.
Interstate Banking and Branching
The Dodd-Frank Act relaxed previous restrictions on interstate branching and national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), requires that the OCC review (1) any merger with an insured bank into a national bank, or (2) any establishment of branches by an insured bank. See “-Bank Merger Act.”
Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders
The authority of the Bank to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members, corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements under the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder, as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans that the Bank may make to directors and other insiders, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts. In addition, all loans the Bank makes to directors and other insiders must satisfy the following requirements:

• | the loans must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Bank;


• | the Bank must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with persons who are not affiliated with the Bank; and


• | the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of non-payment or include other features not favorable to the Bank.

Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators, and these loans are closely scrutinized by the regulators for compliance with Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. Each loan to directors or other insiders must be pre-approved by the Bank’s board of directors with the interested director abstaining from voting.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income areas and borrowers in their local communities. An institution’s size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. Large, retail-oriented institutions are examined using a performance-based lending, investment and service test. Small institutions are examined using a streamlined approach. All institutions may opt to be evaluated under a strategic plan formulated with community input and pre-approved by the bank regulatory agency.
The CRA regulations provide for certain disclosure obligations. Each institution must post a notice advising the public of its right to comment to the institution and its regulator on the institution’s CRA performance and to review the institution’s CRA public file. Each lending institution must maintain for public inspection a file that includes a listing of branch locations and services, a summary of lending activity, a map of its communities and any written comments from the public on its performance in meeting community credit needs. The CRA requires public disclosure of a financial institution’s written CRA evaluations. This requirement promotes enforcement of CRA principles by providing the public with the status of a particular institution’s community reinvestment record.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest examination. In its last CRA examination, the Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating which was disclosed in its CRA Performance Evaluation dated October 3, 2016.

Consumer Laws and Regulations
The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the following list is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender or other designated characteristics and mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in the Bank’s activities.
Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy
Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology. Under Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information.
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices and may not disclose nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. All banks are also required to develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank’s information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing.
UDAP and UDAAP
Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,” referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision.
Monitoring and Reporting Suspicious Activity
Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), financial institutions are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities, as well as transactions involving the transfer or withdrawal of amounts in excess of prescribed limits. The BSA is sometimes referred to as an “anti-money laundering” (“AML”) law. Several AML statutes, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have been enacted to amend the BSA. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with financial institutions and foreign customers. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are also required to establish anti-money laundering programs. The USA PATRIOT Act sets forth minimum standards for these programs, including:

• | the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;


• | the designation of a compliance officer;


• | an ongoing employee training program; and


• | an independent audit function to test the programs.

In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”), has adopted rules addressing a number of related issues, including increasing the cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Any financial institution

complying with these rules will not be deemed to violate the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that are discussed below. Finally, under the regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (the “OFAC”), we are required to monitor and block transactions with certain “specially designated nationals” who OFAC has determined pose a risk to U.S. national security.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates for public companies, such as the Company, a variety of reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and provides for the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”), which enforces auditing, quality control and independence standards for firms that audit SEC-reporting companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes higher standards for auditor independence and restricts the provision of consulting services by auditing firms to companies they audit and requires that certain audit partners be rotated periodically. The law also requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement, and increases the oversight and authority of audit committees of publicly traded companies.
Annual Disclosure Statement
This Annual Report on Form 10-K also serves as the annual disclosure statement of Atlantic Capital pursuant to Part 350 of the FDIC’s rules and regulations. This statement has not been reviewed or confirmed for accuracy or relevance by the FDIC.
