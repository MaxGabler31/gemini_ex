Item 1. Business
Background
 
Reed’s Inc. (the “Company,” or “we,” or “us” throughout this report) is the owner and maker of the nation’s leading portfolio of handcrafted, natural beverages in the natural and specialty foods industry, selling to specialty gourmet, natural food, retail, and convenience stores and restaurants nationwide. The Company also sells through distributors to international markets. The Company’s two major core brands are Reed’s Ginger Beer and Virgil’s soda beverages. Reed’s Ginger Brews are unique in the beverage industry, being brewed, not manufactured, using fresh ginger, spices and fruits in a brewing process predating commercial soft drinks. Virgil’s sodas include award winning Root Beer and other soft drinks that are made using natural ingredients.
Historical Development 
 
Reed’s Original Ginger Brew was created in 1987 by Christopher J. Reed, our founder, and current Chief Innovation Officer. Our product was first introduced to the market in Southern California stores in 1989. By 1990, we began marketing our products through United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) and other natural food distributors and moved our production to a larger facility in Boulder, Colorado. The following year, the Company moved all production to a co-pack facility in Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990’s, we continued to develop and launch new Ginger Brew varieties. Reed’s Ginger Brews reached broad placement in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide through UNFI and other major specialty, natural and gourmet and mainstream food and beverage distributors.
 
In 1997, we began licensing the products of China Cola and eventually acquired the rights to the product in 2000. In 1999, we purchased the Virgil’s Root Beer brand from the Crowley Beverage Company. In 2000, we moved into an 18,000-square foot warehouse property, the Brewery, in Los Angeles, California, to house our west coast production and warehouse facility. The Brewery also serves as our principal executive offices.

On December 12, 2006, we raised $8,000,000 through the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $4.00 per share in our initial public offering, trading on the OTC Bulletin board. Following the public offering, we expanded sales and operations dramatically, initially using a direct store delivery strategy in Southern California, along with other regional independent direct store distributors (DSD). The relationships with DSD’s were supported by our sales staff.
 
In 2007, wed transferred our shares to NASDAQ and raised a net of $7,600,000 in a private placement. We refocused our sales strategy to eliminate company direct store delivery sales and to expand sales to DSD’s and natural food distributors on a national level. We also started selling directly to supermarket grocery stores, which has become a significant portion of our business today.
 
We continually introduced new products and line extensions, such as our California Juice Company products in 2009, Virgil’s diet line of ZERO beverages introduced in 2010, and Dr. Better and Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew in 2011. We commenced offering private label products in 2010; and in 2012 we launched our Culture Club Kombucha line.
 
In 2013, our shares were transferred to the New York Stock Exchange, where we are currently trading.
 
In 2015, we launched Stronger Ginger Brew which contains 50% more fresh ginger than our best-selling Reed’s Extra Ginger Brew.
 
In 2016, the board of directors brought on John Bello to serve as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Bello is the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of South Beach Beverage Company, the maker of nutritionally enhanced teas and juices marketed under the brand name SoBe. After growing the brand to $275 million in revenue over five years, he sold the company for $370 million to Pepsi. A 30-year veteran in the beverage industry, Mr. Bello is streamlining our business model and driving the Company to operate under an “asset-light” model and focus on becoming a premier sale and marketing driven organization.
 
In 2017, we continued the build out of the development of the first natural soda fountain products with trials in a large, national, fast, casual restaurant chain. The soda fountain versions of the popular natural sodas allow restaurants and other fountain concessions to buy the Company’s products for significantly less than the full packaged bottled price and at competitive prices to other fountain products.
 
In 2017, under our new executive management team (see below), we began a complete operational review and developed a detailed action plan to capture performance improvements and drive core brand growth.
 
In 2017, the shareholders expanded the number of board appointed seats to allow for a more multi-dimensional board with strong business experience. We also brought on a new investor and raised financing through a number of transactions through the issuance of a convertible note, warrants, and a $14.0 million shareholder rights offering. Collectively, these transactions raised $19 million for the Company.
 
New Beginnings
 
In our efforts to transform operations and develop the Company into a premier sales and marketing organization, the board of directors brought on several seasoned industry experts to provide leadership and direction to the Company. In June 2017, the board appointed Val Stalowir to be the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Stalowir is a 25-year veteran of the food and beverage industry and brings with him several years of global brand experience including Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, and Yum! Brands and emerging brand experience including Boylan Bottling, Detour Bar, and Zola Acai. Mr. Stalowir has extensive experience in sales and marketing, new product development, and improving operational efficiency. He also has a proven track record of leading brand expansion into international markets and accessing private equity capital in the food and beverage sectors.

With the addition of Mr. Stalowir, the board appointed our founder, Chris Reed as Chief Innovation Officer in order to focus on the launch of a new portfolio of products and strengthen the Company’s existing brand equity. The board’s leadership restructuring also included the retention of Stefan Freeman then interim Chief Executive Officer, to be the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. He brings with him over 25 years of beverage and consumer product industry having served in executive roles in Coca-Cola Refreshments, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, and Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group.
 
At the September 2017 shareholder meeting, the shareholders authorized to increase the number of seats on the Board to nine and authorized an increase in common shares to 40,000,000 shares.
 
On March 24, 2018, the Company received a letter of intent from a party, partially owned by Chris Reed, one of the Company’s current officers and directors, for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Los Angeles plant. It is anticipated the Board of Directors will approve the offer and the sale is anticipated to close during the summer of 2018.
 
We believe these changes to the board, the executive team and the operations will bring welcomed industry and professional strength to the Company which will transform our Company.
 
Industry Overview
 
We offer our portfolio of natural hand-crafted beverages in the natural and specialty foods industry as alternatives to the estimated $100 billion carbonated soft drinks (CSD) market nationwide. The Company’s products are sold across the country and internationally to specialty gourmet, natural food stores, retail stores, convenience stores and restaurants. While we are a top-seller in natural food store markets, we also sell nationally to major grocery chains. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products. We believe as we restructure the Company and develop our sales and marketing functions, we will have the ability to scale and be capable of developing these direct customer relationships.
Carbonated Soft Drink Industry Overview
 
The CSD market continues to be a large category in the overall American consumer beverage industry. According to Nielsen data, eighty-eight percent of American households purchased CSD in 2016. While a very large market, the CSD category continues to experience overall volume declines accounting for 19.8% of stomach share in 2016 compared to 22.7% in 2011. On the other hand, the craft and natural soda category, comprising 1% of total soft drink sales, is growing at a rate of 16% annually.
 
Consumers continue to embrace ginger products. Nielsen’s Jordan Rost stated recently in Beverage Industry, “Despite overall category declines, sales of ginger ale grew 9 percent in 2016 as more consumers focused on gut health and are likely opting for the functional and digestive health benefits of ginger-based soda. While many consumers clearly still want to indulge in soft drinks, they are turning to ginger ale as a way to impart some health benefits.” 
 
The biggest shift seen over the last decade is a redefinition of what it means to eat and drink healthfully. More consumers are opting for naturally healthful products touting organic and natural appeals. In addition, as the craft and natural soda segment is still underdeveloped at only 1% of the total CSD market, we believe there is significant potential to continue to market and sell our portfolio of branded products.
 
Consumer Trends Driving Growth for Our Products
 
In order to effectively sell and market our portfolio of beverages, we remain cognizant of the consumer trends in the marketplace driving the continued growth for ginger beer and craft sodas:
 
Better-for-You and Healthier Products: Consumers continue to gravitate toward natural products which are growing 10-15% a year and four to five times faster than their mainstream counterparts; consumers want simple, natural ingredients. They are also looking for beverages with function (e.g., the superfood ginger has health benefits).
 

5
-

 

Reducing Sugar: Consumers are moving away from high sugar beverages and artificially sweetened products.
 
Authentic and Distinct Brands: Broad, cross-generational products appeal to consumers. Boomers and Millennials gravitate to brands with an authentic story (‘retro’), unique liquid, and packaging.
 
Affordable Indulgence: Consumers are indulging themselves with affordable everyday premium refreshment beverages, 85% regular and 15% diet, with a slight male skew.
 
Trading up to Premium and Craft: There is a strong growth in the $500 million craft soda and premium mixer industry segments. Consumers are looking for small batch, handcrafted, higher quality, and authentic bold flavors.
 
The Craft Soda Category is Underdeveloped: The craft soda segment is underdeveloped relative to other super-premium food and beverage categories; it is currently less than 1% of the overall CSD category.
 
On-Premise: There is an opportunity to upsell to the on-premise market segment given the market’s desire for a beverage with a non-alcoholic, strong flavor alternative.
 
Demand for Premium Mixed Drinks: Leading the way in demand has been the Moscow Mule, but the Gin & Ginger and the Dark ‘n Stormy, both of which have ginger bases, have also been on the rise in popularity.
 
Our strategies will remain responsive to these consumer trends as we concentrate our efforts on developing the Company’s sales and marketing functions.
 
Our Products 
 
We manufacture our hand-crafted natural beverages using premium natural ingredients. Our products are free of genetically modified organisms (GMO). Over the years, the Company has developed several product offerings. In 2017, we narrowed our focus to our core product flavor offerings of Reed’s Ginger Beer flavors and Virgil’s Craft Sodas. We may re-introduce at a later date our Kombucha and China Cola brands.
Reed’s Ginger Beers
 
Ginger ale is the oldest known soft drink. Before modern soft drink technology existed, non-alcoholic beverages were brewed at home directly from herbs, roots, spices, and fruits. These handcrafted brews were highly prized for their taste, tonic, and health-giving properties. Reed’s Ginger Beers are a revival of this lost art of home brewing sodas. We make them with care and attention to wholesomeness and quality, using the finest fresh herbs, roots, spices, and fruits.
 
We believe Reed’s Ginger Beers are unique in their kettle-brewed origin among all mass-marketed soft drinks. Reed’s Ginger Beers contain between 17 and 39 grams of fresh ginger in every 12-ounce bottle. Our products differ from commercial soft drinks in three characteristics: sweetening, carbonation, and coloring for greater adult appeal. We sweeten our products using pure cane sugar. Instead of using injected-based carbonation, we produce our carbonation naturally, through slower, beer-oriented techniques. This process produces smaller, longer lasting bubbles which do not dissipate rapidly when the bottle is opened. We do not add coloring. The color of our products comes naturally from herbs, fruits, spices, roots, and juices.
 
Since Reed’s Ginger Brews are pasteurized, they do not require or contain any preservatives. In contrast, modern commercial soft drinks are typically produced using natural and artificial flavor concentrates prepared by flavor laboratories, tap water, and highly refined sweeteners. Manufacturers make a centrally processed concentrate which lends itself to a wide variety of situations, waters, and filling systems. The final product is generally cold-filled and requires preservatives for stability. Added colors are either artificial, or if natural, they are often highly processed.

The Reed’s Ginger Brews line contain the following products:
 
Reed’s Original Ginger Brew was our first creation and is a Jamaican recipe for homemade ginger ale using 17 grams of fresh ginger root, lemon, lime, honey, raw cane sugar, pineapple, herbs and spices. Reed’s Original Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice.
 
Reed’s Premium Ginger Brew is sweetened only with honey and pineapple juice. Reed’s Premium Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice and contains 17 grams of fresh ginger root.
 
Reeds Extra Ginger Brew is the same recipe as Original Ginger Brew, but has 26 grams of fresh ginger root for a stronger bite.
 
Reeds Stronger Ginger Brew has 50% more ginger than the Extra Ginger Brew and has the highest ginger content of any of our beverage products.
 
Reed’s Raspberry Ginger Brew is brewed from 17 grams of fresh ginger root, raspberry juice, and lime. Reed’s Raspberry Ginger Brew is 20% raspberry juice.
 
Reed’s Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew is a reduced calorie version of our top selling Reed’s Extra Ginger Brew, made possible by using Stevia. We use the same recipe of 26 grams of fresh ginger root, honey, pineapple, lemon and lime juices, and exotic spices.
 
Reed’s Natural Energy Elixir is an energy drink infused with all-natural ingredients designed to provide consumers with a healthy and natural boost to energy levels.
 
Virgil’s Root Beer
 
Virgil’s is a premium craft root beer made with natural ingredients. Our root beer contains filtered water, unbleached cane sugar, and spices sourced from around the world such as anise from Spain, licorice from France, bourbon vanilla from Madagascar, cinnamon from Sri Lanka, clove from Indonesia, wintergreen from China, sweet birch and molasses from the southern United States, nutmeg from Indonesia, pimento berry oil from Jamaica, balsam oil from Peru, and cassia oil from China. We purchase these ingredients from vendors who source these spices worldwide and gather them together at the brewing and bottling facilities. We combine these ingredients under strict specifications and finally heat-pasteurize all Virgil’s sodas, to ensure quality. We sell Virgil’s in 12-ounce bottles in both 4 packs and 12 pack boxes. The Virgil’s soda line is also GMO free.
 
In addition to our Virgil’s Root Beer, we also offer a Virgil’s Cream Soda and Virgil’s Black Cherry Cream Soda, Virgil’s Orange Cream Soda, and a Virgil’s ZERO line. In 2018our Virgil’s ZERO line of 100% Stevia sweetened and zero calorie sodas will be replaced by our NEW Virgil’s O Sugar line of craft sodas. This new natural line of Zero Sugar flavors includes Root Beer, Cola, Lemon-lime, Orange, Black Cherry, and Cream soda.
 
Other Products
 
We have other popular brands with limited distribution including our Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer and Sonoma Sparkler brand of sparkling juices designed to be celebratory drinks for holidays and special occasions.
Prior Product Innovations
 
We are experts in flavor and recipe development and have developed many innovative and award-winning products and line extensions. With the expansion of our management team of beverage industry professionals and the added Chief Innovation Officer position, we will continue to be at the forefront of developing flavor profiles and products.
 
While product innovation will remain a top priority, we have discontinued some drinks in response to various market conditions including changes in consumer preferences and price points in various markets.

These innovations which have sold well in the past, may be reintroduced to the marketplace in the future given favorable market conditions. These products include:
 

● | Reed’s Ginger Brews: Reed’s Spiced Apple Brew, Reed’s Cherry Ginger Brew, and Reed’s Nausea Relief. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reed’s Kombucha: all flavors. 
● | Other Products: China Cola, certain private label products, and Reed’s ice creams. 

Our Primary Markets
 
We target a niche in the estimated $100 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the U.S., Canada, and international markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural, with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal (craft), premium bottled carbonated soft drink category.
 
During 2017, management began simplifying operations in order to focus the Company on becoming a premier sales and marketing organization. The new management team is currently assessing best strategies to augment our existing sales and marketing efforts by utilizing industry brokers and outside advertising firms.
 
We have an experienced and geographically diverse sales force promoting our products with senior sales representatives strategically placed in five regions across the country, supported by local Reeds sales staff. Our sales managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales, distribution, and marketing of our brands to our entire retail partner and distributor network in North America. The Company also employs an internal sales force and engages from time to time and in limited circumstances, independent sales brokers and outside representatives to promote our products.
 
We sell to well-known popular natural food and gourmet retailers, large grocery store chains, club stores, convenience and drug stores, liquor stores, industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders), and to on premise bars, gourmet restaurants, and delicatessens worldwide. We also sell our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through our Company website, www.reedsgingerbrew.com.
 
Some of our key customers include:
 
Natural stores: Whole Foods Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, Natural Grocers, Earth Fare, and Fresh Thyme Famers Market
 
Gourmet & Specialty stores: Trader Joe’s, Bristol Farms, The Fresh Market, and Central Market
 
Grocery store chains: Kroger, Safeway, Publix, Stop & Shop, H.E.B., and Wegmans
 
Club and Mass Stores: Costco Wholesale, Target, and Walmart
 
Liquor stores: BevMo!, Total Wine & More, and Spec’s
 
Convenience & Drug stores: Circle K, Rite Aid, and CVS Pharmacy
 
Our Distribution Network
 
Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse, and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices. Our products are brought to market through an extremely flexible and fluid hybrid distribution model.

8
-

 

Our product reaches the market in the following ways:
 
Direct to Natural & Specialty Wholesale Distributors
 
Our natural and specialty distributor partners operate a distribution network delivering thousands of SKUs of natural and gourmet products to thousands of small, independent, natural retail outlets around the U.S., along with national chain customers, both conventional and natural. This system of distribution allows our brands far reaching access to some of the most remote parts of North America.
 
Direct to Store Distribution (DSD) through alcoholic and non-alcoholic distributor network
 
Our independent distributor partners operate DSD systems which deliver primarily beverages, foods, and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by their route sales and field sales employees. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products frequently restocked and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.
 
Direct to Store Warehouse Distribution
 
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses directly to customer warehouses. Some retailers mandate we deliver directly to them, as it is more cost effective and allows them to pass savings along to their consumer. Other retailers may not mandate direct delivery, but they recommend and prefer it as they have the capability to self-distribute and can realize significant savings with direct delivery.
Wholesale Distribution
 
Our Wholesale Distributor network handles the wholesale shipments of our products. They have a warehouse, distribution center and ship Reed’s and Virgil’s products directly to the Retailer (or to customers who opt for drop shipping).
International Distribution
 
We presently export Reed’s and Virgil’s brands throughout international markets via US based exporters. Some markets are: Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Canada, Philippines, U.K., Israel, South Africa, and Australia.
 
International sales to some areas of the world are cost prohibitive, except for some specialty sales, since our premium sodas are packed in glass, which drives substantial freight costs when shipping overseas. Despite these cost challenges, we believe there are good opportunities for expansion of sales in Canada, the Middle East, England, and Australia and we are increasing our marketing focus on these areas by adding freight friendly packages such as aluminum cans. We are open to exporting and co-packing internationally and expanding our brands into foreign markets, and we have held preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of our products throughout Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. We believe these areas are a natural fit for Reed’s ginger products, because of the importance of ginger in international markets, especially the Asian market, where ginger is a significant part of diet and nutrition.
 
We believe the strength of our brands, innovation, and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.
 
Agreements
 
We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors who commit us to “termination fees” if we terminate our agreements early or without cause. These agreements call for our customer to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry, if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement, we would be obligated to make certain payments to our customers. We are in constant review of our distribution agreements with our partners across North America.

Competition
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other branding campaigns. In addition, the companies manufacturing these products generally have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do. Competitors include the brands such as Henry Weinhard’s, Thomas Kemper, Hansen’s, Izze, and Boylan, and Jones Soda.
 
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising, and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could also cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion.
 
Despite our products having a relatively high price for an artisanal premium beverage product, minimal mass media advertising, and a relatively small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors, we believe our all-natural innovative beverage recipes, packaging, use of premium ingredients, and a trade secret brewing process provide us with a competitive advantage and our commitments to the highest quality standards and brand innovation are keys to our success.
 
Manufacture of Our Products
 
In 2017, management began concentrated efforts to work toward a business model to outsource our manufacturing processes and develop the operations into a premier sales and marketing company. Management began exploring the utilization of larger, efficient co-packers than the ones we use currently. While we explore these options, we continue to manufacture our product in three locations. Our Los Angeles facility known as “The Brewery,” is located at our Company’s headquarters, and there we produce certain soda and private label products. On March 24, 2018, the Company received a letter of intent from a party, partially owned by Chris Reed, one of the Company’s current officers and directors, for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Los Angeles plant. It is anticipated the Board of Directors will approve the offer and the sale is anticipated to close during the summer of 2018. We also partner with two co-pack facilities which assemble our products and charge us a fee, generally by the case, for the products produced by them. These two facilities are in Indiana and Pennsylvania.
Raw Materials
 
Our products consist of two major raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. Generally, the raw materials used in our products are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers and most of the materials have multiple, reliable suppliers. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction or calamity. Since our raw materials are common ingredients, and supply is easily accessible, we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers.
 
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications. Reed’s Crystallized Ginger is made to our specifications in Fiji. Reed’s Ginger Candy Chews are made and packed to our specifications in Indonesia.
 
A significant component of our product cost are the glass bottles used for our drinks. In December 2017, in efforts to restructure our supply chain and drive cost savings in the largest component of our raw material costs, we entered into a strategic partnership with a glass supplier, Owen-Illinois, who will serve as the Company’s exclusive glass supplier. Owen-Illinois will also provide their expertise in embossing and proprietary package design for the Company.
 
Production
 
In 2017, in our focused efforts to simplify operations, we streamlined our portfolio of over one hundred separate SKUs to focus on approximately 28 SKUs which comprise primarily two brands: Reeds and Virgil’s with twelve flavors. These two brands have two primary packaging configurations consisting of 24 6 by 4 pack cases and single 12 pack cases.

10
--

 

We also categorize our portfolio by non-core and discontinued SKU’s containing multiple brands. The non-core SKU’s are being evaluated and include such products as ginger candy, private label, and specialty packaging such as swing top lid beverages. The discontinued products category is defined as SKU’s not in the Company’s immediate production plans. Reed’s may re-introduce these items as market conditions change or improve.
 
Management is constantly in the process of evaluating SKUs to maximize products with favorable results and make room for new inventions.
 
Warehousing and Distribution
 
Raw material handling and finished goods delivery costs also account for a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing and delivery processes. In December 2017, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with R.C. Moore as its primary logistics partner for North America. R.C. Moore, by utilizing their supply chain management expertise, transportation assets, and their beverage industry experience, will help the Company reduce logistics costs.
 
We follow a “fill as needed” manufacturing model to the best of our ability and have no significant order backlog.
 
New Product Development 
 
While we are simplifying our business and streamlined dozens of SKUs in 2017 in order to further our primary objective of accelerating the growth of the Reed’s and Virgil’s core product offerings, we believe significant opportunity remains in the all-natural beverage space. Healthier alternatives will be the future for carbonated soft drinks. We will continue to drive product development in the all-natural, no and low sugar offerings in the “better for you” beverage categories. In addition, we believe there are powerful consumer trends that will help propel the growth of our brand portfolio including the increased consumption of ginger as a recognized superfood, the growing use of ginger beer in today’s popular cocktail drinks, and consumers increased demand for higher quality, all-natural handcrafted beverages.
 
In 2017, with Chris Reed, the Company’s founder and former Chief Executive Officer, appointed to the newly created position of Chief Innovation Officer and directing his full energies toward new offerings, we developed our first natural soda fountain products and continued a trial in a large national, casual, restaurant chain. We also continued the development of our compelling line of full flavor, all-natural, low calories sodas. These sodas contain only a fraction of the calories of traditional sugar-based sodas yet still have the full, robust taste of traditional sodas.
 
We believe as we continue to transform our business model, it will enhance our ability to be nimble and innovative, producing new products in a short period of time.
 
Proprietary Rights
 
We own trademarks we consider material to our business. Three of our material trademarks are registered trademarks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Reed’s Original Ginger Brew All-Natural Jamaican Style Ginger Ale ®, and Virgil’s ®. . Registrations for trademarks in the United States will last indefinitely as long as we continue to use and police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices. We have not been challenged in our right to use any of our material trademarks in the United States. We intend to obtain international registration of certain trademarks in foreign jurisdictions.
 
In addition, we consider our finished product and concentrate formulae, which are not the subject of any patents, to be trade secrets. Our brewing process is a trade secret. This process can be used to brew flavors of beverages other than ginger ale and ginger beer, such as root beer, cream soda, cola, and other spice and fruit beverages. We have not sought any patents on our brewing processes because we would be required to disclose our brewing process in patent applications.
 
We generally use non-disclosure agreements with employees and distributors to protect our proprietary rights.

Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Company’s products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.
 
A California law requires a specific warning appear on any product containing a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. This is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances occurring naturally or contributing to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be added to the California list in the future, although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine and other natural occurring substances will be evaluated for listing. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.
 
Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
All of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our primary cost environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state, based upon the number of bottles of certain products sold in the state.
