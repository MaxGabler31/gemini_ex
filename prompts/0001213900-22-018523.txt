Milestones



Daniel M. Early/Modular Water Systems™



On June 22, 2018, OriginClear signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Daniel “Dan” Early for his proprietary technology for prefabricated water transport and treatment systems. On July 19, 2018, the Company began incubating its Modular Water Treatment Division (MWS) around Mr. Early’s technology and perspective customers. The Company has funded the development of this division with internal cash flow. In Q1 of 2020, the Company fully integrated MWS with wholly-owned Progressive Water Treatment Inc. Mr. Early currently serves as Chief Engineer for OriginClear.
Progressive Water Treatment Inc.



On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment Inc. (“PWT”), a designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment applications. PWT, together with MWS, other proprietary technologies and potential future acquisitions, aims to offer a complementary, end-to-end offering to serve growing corporate demand for outsourced water treatment.



PWT’s Business



Since 1995, PWT has been designing and manufacturing a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. PWT designs and manufactures a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. Its uniqueness is its ability to gain an in-depth understanding of customer’s needs and then to design and build an integrated water treatment system using multiple technologies to provide a complete solution for its customers.



PWT utilizes a wide range of technologies, including chemical injection, media filters, membrane, ion exchange and SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) technology in turnkey systems. PWT also offers a broad range of services including maintenance contracts, retrofits and replacement assistance. In addition, PWT rents equipment in contracts of varying duration. Customers are primarily served in the United States and Canada, with the company’s reach extending worldwide from Siberia to Argentina to the Middle East. 



PWT Milestones



In the first quarter of 2019, the Company increased the number of the manufacturer’s representatives for its operating units, PWT and Modular Water Systems (“MWS”).

On Nov 7, 2019, the Company published a case study showing how its Modular Water System may help automotive dealerships expand into rural land. The case study shows how point-of-use treatment solves lack of access to the public sewer system.



On March 5, 2020, the Company announced disruptive pump and lift station pricing, stating that its prefabricated modules with a lifespan of up to 100 years now compete with precast concrete. 



On April 15, 2021, the Company announced that its Progressive Water Treatment division is now shipping BroncBoost™, its workhorse Booster Pump Station equipment line. Engineered and built in Texas, BroncBoost allows customers to control water flow rates and pressure for mission critical water distribution systems. 



On August 25, 2021, PWT entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with a large US public utility company for water filtration systems that will provide process water at three power plants. The utility issued a purchase order for approximately $1.8 million, for the first power plant. The total purchase price payable to PWT under the MSA is approximately $5 million, subject to certain conditions, including receipt and acceptance by PWT of additional purchase orders. We expect the overall contract to take up to two years to deliver from the date of the MSA.



In 2021, PWT received $11,319,541 in firm orders. This contrasts with $3,506,020 received in firm orders by PWT for the entirety of 2020. Orders are only a potential indication of future sales and revenue.



Modular Water Systems



On July 19, 2018, the Company launched its Modular Water Treatment Division, offering a unique product line of prefabricated water transport and treatment systems. Daniel “Dan” Early P.E. (Professional Engineer) heads the Modular Water Systems (“MWS”) division. On June 25, 2018, Dan Early granted the Company a worldwide, exclusive non-transferable license to the technology and knowhow behind MWS (See “Intellectual Property”. A ten-year renewal on May 20, 2020 added the right to sublicense and create manufacturing joint ventures. On July 25, 2018, MWS received its first order, for a brewery wastewater treatment plant.



With PWT and other companies as fabricators and assemblers, MWS designs, manufactures and delivers prefabricated water transport (pump stations) and wastewater treatment plant (“WWTP”) products to customers and end-users which are required to clean their own wastewater, such as schools, small communities, institutional facilities, real estate developments, factories, and industrial parks.



On September 28, 2021, the Company announced that MWS deployed its first Pondster™ brand modular lagoon treatment system at a Mobile Home Park (MHP) or trailer park, in Troy, Alabama. At the heart of the system is an innovative biofilm treatment process which holds promise as a core technology offering of the Company.



After just eight days, the lagoon exhibited rapid improvement in water quality (see before and after image), which is continuing. As of December 31, 2021, the Troy, Alabama project had not completed its water testing requirements and the Company continues to enhance the Pondster operation in light of lessons learned in the field. The Company regards these efforts and additional expenses as intrinsic to the commercial pilot process.




3











In 2021, MWS received $1,774,880 in firm orders. This contrasts with $735,150 received in firm orders by MWS for the entirety of 2020.



Orders are only an indication of future revenue.



Water on Demand™: a new strategic direction.



OriginClear is also developing a new outsourced water treatment business called “Water On Demand”: or “WOD” as a potential revenue source. The WOD model intends to offer private businesses the ability to pay for water treatment and purification services on a per-gallon basis. This is commonly known as Design-Build-Own-Operate or “DBOO”. On April 13, 2021, we announced formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary called Water On Demand #1, Inc. (“WOD #1”) to pursue capitalization of the equipment required. Additional subsidiaries have since been created for the purposed of segmenting capital pools according to strategic partnerships.



The Company intends to pilot a first DBOO contract and thereafter, work with regional water service companies to build and operate the water treatment systems it finances.



On March 23, 2022, the Company announced that it was evaluating the first pilot opportunity, a 50,000 gallon per day wastewater treatment project.



Delegating the building and operating of WOD-financed systems to regional water companies under performance contract, with the aim of developing a network of such partners, is expected to enable rapid scale-up of the WOD program, and the partner network would create a high barrier to entry for competitors.



Reducing Risk through Outsourcing



Inflation of water rates greatly exceeds core inflation (see Figure 2), creating a risk for managers of businesses served by municipalities. We believe this creates an incentive for self-treatment; but these businesses may lack the capital for large water plant expenditures, and the in-house expertise to manage them. Outsourcing through Water on Demand means that these companies do not have to worry about financing or managing the project.



As an example, in information technology sector, a limited number of companies operate their own server in-house powering their website. Rather, such servers are typically managed by professionals through a service level agreement. We believe this same concept can be applied towards water treatment, using outsourced water treatment solutions whereby the vendor retains ownership of the equipment. This concept is expanded to “Own and Operate”, an extension of the basic “Design and Build”, for a full offering known as “Design Build Own and Operate” or “DBOO”, which is very similar to the solar energy programs known as Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).





4







Under such a plan, a business can outsource its wastewater treatment and avoid significant capital expenses and management responsibilities which can be a distraction from their core business.



We believe this is financially and operationally attractive to industrial, agricultural and commercial water users and can potentially drive additional revenue streams for OriginClear by providing water treatment as a service.




The Decentralization Megatrend






An updated report of October 2018, “Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, 1956 to 2017” (https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-10/54539-Infrastructure.pdf), stated that The Federal Government’s and State and Local Governments’ Spending on Water Utilities, including water supply and wastewater treatment facilities, was $4 billion in 2016.



As municipalities continue to be underfunded (Figure 1) with rising water rates (Figure 2), businesses are increasingly choosing to treat and purify their own water, in a trend known as Decentralized Water, first described in the Lux Research presentation of June 28, 2016. (https://members.luxresearchinc.com/research/report/20060).




5













Small, modular systems as sold by our Modular Water Systems division meet the needs of this new segment. 




 We believe that our ability to deliver modular systems gives us a competitive advantage over larger water companies when it comes to DBOO for smaller systems.



Also, the portable nature of these prefabricated, drop-in-place Modular Water Systems may provide a competitive benefit for a pure service model where the equipment remains the property of the Company, because their mobility enables some degree of repossession in the event the client fails to pay their monthly bill. We believe this is a key competitive advantage.



Finally, we could license MWS technology to Water On Demand operating partners under contract to design, build and operate systems, thus achieving both acceptance of such technology and a standardized “fleet” of installed systems.



Implementation of Water On Demand



On March 17, 2021, OriginClear incorporated Water On Demand #1 Inc. (“WOD#1”) in Nevada as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate and manage our Water on Demand business.



In November 2021, the Company created additional Water on Demand subsidiaries – Water on Demand # 2, Inc. (WOD # 2), Water on Demand # 3, Inc. (WOD # 3) and Water on Demand # 4, Inc. (WOD # 4). Each subsidiary (each a “WOD Subsidiary”, and collectively the “WOD Subsidiaries”) is wholly owned by OriginClear, Inc. These WOD Subsidiaries were created in order to align with the incentives of the Company’s various strategic partners. Each WOD Subsidiary (other than WOD #1), is associated with a different strategic partner and will be compensated based on the profitability of that WOD Subsidiary.





6







The Company requires funding in order to execute on its Water on Demand initiative. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had received initial funding in the amount of $635,000 through the sale of its Series Y Preferred Stock (see Notes to Financial Statements- Sale of Preferred Stock). 



On March 23, 2022, the Company announced that it had received over $1 million in capital through the sale of its Series Y Preferred Stock which capital is dedicated to the Water on Demand program.



The Company is now actively evaluating potential clients for a test of water treatment and purification services on a pay-per-gallon basis, but a first agreement has not been reached. Also, the Company is in early stage talks with partners to deliver DBOO services, with the Company handling contract management, finance and ownership. In the event such talks do not succeed, the Company would need to implement its own resources for such DBOO services.



Advisory Support for OriginClear



In September, 2020 OriginClear announced that Philanthroinvestors had entered a strategic agreement with OriginClear and had listed the Company on its new Water Philanthroinvestors program. At the same time, OriginClear appointed Philanthroinvestors Founder, Ivan Anz and CEO, Arte Maren to OriginClear’s Board of Advisors.

 

$H2O™ 



On May 10, 2021, OriginClear filed a patent application for its “System And Method For Water Treatment Incentive”, which includes blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (“NFT(s)”) to simplify the distribution of payments on outsourced water treatment and purification services billed on a pay-per-gallon basis ahead of inflation, or Water On Demand.



On May 16, 2021, the Company applied for a registered trademark for the mark $H2O (also referred to as H2O) as the blockchain system representing this activity. The current filing basis is “Intent-to-use basis” (under Trademark Act Section 1(b)).



On June 10, 2021, the Company named Ricardo Fabiani Garcia, an OriginClear investor and veteran technologist, to the Company’s Board of Advisors. Mr. Garcia will advise the management team as it sets up the roadmap and chooses the resources for the $H2O project.



The basic intended use of the blockchain system is to streamline payments and eliminate human error, similar to other coins, such as the J.P. Morgan “JPM Coin.”1



Our patent application is the first step in our development process for this blockchain system, which we expect to last at least several months. We are not currently a blockchain or cryptocurrency developer and would need to develop or contract for this capability. There is no guarantee that this effort would succeed. There is no active development effort for $H2O. Depending on the final form that $H2O takes, we may encounter regulatory concerns that we cannot guarantee we will overcome. In that event, we would fall back on ordinary financial payment systems.  Neither our Water on Demand or other current business models rely on any blockchain system for operation, and we can accomplish our operational goals using ordinary financial and currency channels.



ClearAqua™



OriginClear is currently exploring a prospective utility coin, or token, named ClearAqua, It is the Company’s intent that ClearAqua will be used to create a grassroots network of users which will be able to govern actionable proposals for water projects. There is no assurance this token will be issued or if issued, will be successful.








1 | “In 2019, J.P. Morgan became the first global bank to design a network to facilitate instantaneous payments using blockchain technology - enabling 24/7, business-to-business money movement by unveiling JPM Coin.” (https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have filed, on an intent-to-use basis, US Trademark applications on July 21, 2021, for the Mark, CLEARAQUA, and the phrase “THE WATER COIN FOR THE WORLD”. We have also engaged San Diego-based Baja Technologies Inc. (“Baja”) to develop and help launch ClearAqua but no other action has been taken and ClearAqua is not in active development at this time.



Patents and Intellectual Property



On May 10, 2021, OriginClear announced that it had filed “System And Method For Water Treatment Incentive”, a patent application for using blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to simplify the distribution of payments on outsourced water treatment and purification services billed on a pay-per-gallon basis ahead of inflation. 



On June 25, 2018, Dan Early granted the Company a worldwide, exclusive non-transferable license to intellectual property consisting of five issued US patents, and design software, CAD, marketing, design and specification documents (“Early IP”).



On May 20, 2020, we agreed on a renewal of the license for an additional ten years, with three-year extensions. We also gained the right to sublicense, and, with approval, to create ISO-compliant manufacturing joint ventures.



The Early IP consists of combined protection on the materials and configurations of complete packaged water treatment systems, built into containers. The patents consist of the following:




# | Description | Patent No. | Date Patent Issued | Expiration Date
--+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------
1 | Wastewater System & Method | US 8,372,274 B2 Applications: WIPO, Mexico | 02/12/13 | 07/16/31 
2 | Steel Reinforced HDPE Rainwater Harvesting | US 8,561,633 B2 | 10/22/13 | 05/16/32 
3 | Wastewater Treatment System CIP | US 8,871,089 B2 | 10/28/14 | 05/07/32 
4 | Scum Removal System for Liquids | US 9,205,353 B2 | 12/08/15 | 02/19/34 
5 | Portable, Steel Reinforced HDPE Pump Station CIP | US 9,217,244 B2 | 12/22/15 | 10/20/31 




With the rising need for local, point-of-use or point-of-discharge water treatment solutions, the Modular Water Systems licensed IP family is the core to a portable, integrated, transportable, plug-and-play system that, unlike other packaged solutions, can be manufactured in series, have a longer life and are more respectful of the environment.



The common feature of this IP family is the use of a construction material (Structural Reinforced ThermoPlastic), for the containers that is:




● | more durable: an estimated 75 to 100-year life cycle as opposed to a few decades for metal, or 40 to 50 years maximum for concrete; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | easier to manufacture: vessels manufacturing process can be automated; and 
● | recyclable and can be made out of biomaterials 




In addition, patents US 8,372,274 and US 8,871,089 (1 and 3) relate to the use of vessels or containers made out of this material combined with a configuration of functional modules, or process, for general water treatment.



Other subsequent patents, which build upon the original claims, focus on more targeted applications. These patents outline a given combination of modules engineered inside the vessel to address a specific water treatment challenge.

Expansion of the PWT and MWS Business-Lines



Beginning with its first installation, PWT built MWS components. PWT and MWS are now fully integrated as a single profit and manufacturing center. 



In April 2019, we completed the expansion of our manufacturer’s representative network to serve both PWT and MWS for customer lead generation. 

  

PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES



The Company deploys advanced technologies at the point of use, with modular, prefabricated systems that create durable assets and water independence for industry, commerce and agriculture.



Failing infrastructure and the rising cost of water are driving businesses to treat their own water. The Company provides on-premise systems enabling very high purification and recycling levels that centralized systems cannot achieve. Systems installed at the point of use become productive assets for businesses that also increase property values. Furthermore, the Company’s products help corporations improve their environmental, social and governance (ESG) standings with water management services.



Operations & Markets



The Company focuses on meeting the needs of businesses looking for compact, advanced water treatment technologies that can be shipped to and installed at the point of use. The Company manufactures and distributes its professional-grade water treatment and conveyance products to commercial and industrial customers, fielding both direct and indirect sales channels to reach end-market clients such as hotels and resorts, real estate housing developments, office buildings, military installations, schools, farms, food and beverage manufacturers, industrial warehouse, oil and gas producers, and medical and pharmaceutical facilities.



From its Texas-based factory, the Company designs and prefabricates an entire line of plug-n-play containerized units called Modular Water Systems that enable water purification, recycling and wastewater management.

These onsite modular products provide clients with water independence through ownership and operational control over water quality, enabling them to increase productivity while reducing environmental, health and safety risks from pollution, contamination and corrosion. Modular water products are trusted to balance performance with cost-effectiveness, enabling business users to go well beyond municipal standards for water quality, therefore achieving high levels of satisfaction for their own customers, and improved sustainability for their properties.



The Company’s water treatment equipment can boost real estate asset value as a fundamental capital improvement, combined with long-lasting water savings for the corporate bottom line.



Product Portfolio



The Company groups its products into three main categories:




● | Water Treatment: achieving high grade purification; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Water Conveyance: water transportation and pumping; and 
● | Advanced Technologies: commercialization of innovative technologies.




The Company’s complete line of compact, on-site, point-of-use products include: advanced purification systems that are skid, rack-mounted and containerized for reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, media filtration, disinfection, water softening, ion exchange and electrodeionization (EDI), combined as needed in small to medium commercial and industrial applications, and custom-build projects. Water conveyance products include pump and lifting stations, modular storage tanks, and control monitoring panels.



 The Company’s line of modular water products and systems create “instant infrastructure” – fully engineered, prefabricated and prepackaged systems that use durable, sophisticated materials. The units are available in standard capacities for onsite closed-loop systems at commercial business locations.



The Company’s rugged wastewater treatment plants, highly reliable pump stations, and premium water purification units typically offer 25 percent lower initial costs over conventional systems, with greater quality and full connectivity. These pump stations and wastewater treatment products utilize high density thermo-plastics (HDPE) and proprietary, innovative prefabrication methods and materials that deliver the longest life and strongest products.



Original Technologies



Electro Water Separation™ (“EWS”) and Advanced Oxidation™ (“AOx”) were the Company’s original, filterless water treatment technologies, which originated in the Company’s invention of an algae dewatering process before its transition into the water industry.



EWS is OriginClear’s breakthrough water cleanup technology which utilizes a catalytic process to concentrate and eliminate suspended solids in the worst commercial and industrial wastewater.



AOx is OriginClear’s advanced oxidation technology which generates a dense cloud of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, dramatically reducing or eliminating dissolved organic microtoxins, including bacteria and viruses, hormones, drugs, pesticides such as Roundup, and synthetics. AOx has also been shown to effectively reduce harmful chemicals such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide – the “rotten egg” smell in crude oil that reduces its value. 



At this time, the Company is strictly marketing the EWS/AOx technology in the context of turnkey integrators such as India’s Permionics and Spain’s Depuporc. (Depuporc permanently terminated its operations in 2021 due to COVID-19 business disruptions and no future business is expected). In addition, US-based Algeternal is our partner for the original algae-harvesting applications of this technology, and reportedly continues to use Company equipment for this purpose. The Company does not maintain an internal technical staff to manage this technology or its implementation and has no plans to do so.

Market Opportunity



On a global basis, only twenty percent (20%) of all sewage and thirty percent (30%) of all industrial waste are ever treated. Water leakage results in the loss of thirty-five percent (35%) of all clean water across the planet. Cutting that number in half would provide clean water for 100 million people. This is a situation of great danger, but also great potential.



We believe businesses can no longer rely on giant, centralized water utilities to meet the challenge. That is why more and more business users are doing their own water treatment and recycling. Whether by choice or necessity, those businesses that invest in onsite water systems gain a tangible asset on their business and real estate and can enjoy better water quality at a lower cost, especially if treated water is recycled.



We believe self-reliant businesses are quietly building “decentralized water wealth” for themselves while also helping their communities. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing guidelines, which drive about a quarter of all professionally managed assets around the world, specifically include the key factor of how well corporations manage water.




The Company seeks to provide ESG compliant water management for corporations that are increasingly responsible for what was once delegated to central utilities. For example, when a corporation manages its own water, and uses OriginClear’s proprietary hybrid treatment methods, it can significantly reduce both water use and nutrient footprints (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in one compact package. These hybrid processes feature advanced blackwater treatment with advanced clean water processing. They can convert toxic nutrients to less harmful compounds, and even capture them for beneficial reuse purposes, as shown in OriginClear’s recent case study.




11








Integration of Operating Divisions



Since being acquired by OriginClear in 2015, Progressive Water Treatment, Inc. has evolved into the Company’s fabrication and manufacturing division for the all of the Company’s endeavors. The team at Modular Water Systems, headed by OriginClear Chief Engineer Daniel M. Early, is responsible for design and high-level engineering, and is fully integrated with PWT for the fabrication and manufacturing division to add incremental revenue for its modular product line, without requiring large increases in personnel.
Supplier Relationship



PWT has been purchasing equipment from its many suppliers for over twenty years, with potential long-term benefits from the relationships.



MWS is positioned to take advantage of PWT’s supplier relationships, but certain components are unique to MWS’s product line. In particular, SRTP pipe is unique, for which the Company has four manufacturers, with the preferred SRTP supplier being approximately 40 miles south of PWT’s facility.
Water On Demand



In addition to our MWS and PWT lines of business, we also plan to expand our planned water outsourcing program known as “Design Build Own and Operate” or “DBOO”. Typically, DBOO has been done for very large municipal and national projects. If we are successful in raising the necessary capital, we plan to deliver DBOO for smaller systems in the $250,000-$2,000,000 hardware range (treating between 5,000 and 100,000 gallons per day). With a growing number of local businesses doing their own water treatment, we see this as a promising and underserved market.
CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS



Current water and wastewater treatment infrastructure faces a crisis. The prohibitive cost of repairing buried and aging infrastructure and the need to decrease energy use and waste in the water industry offers an opportunity for a complete design rethink. New technologies, often utilizing membranes, can decentralize water and wastewater infrastructure while improving water reuse by treating to a high standard at a small scale close to the source of generation. Additionally, new automated analytics offer solutions for these more complex decentralized solutions. (Lux Research: The Future of Decentralized Water, June 28, 2016). PWT has designed and fabricated water treatment systems for over twenty years. Major markets include:

● | Potable Water for Small Communities 
--+-------------------------------------------------------
● | Recirculated and Makeup Boiler and Cooling Tower Water
● | Produced Water & Frac Flowback Water 
● | Food and Beverage Feed and Effluent Waters 
● | Mining Effluent 
● | Ground Water Recovery 
● | Agriculture Effluent 
● | Environmental Water Treatment for Reuse 






12







Describing the water and wastewater treatment market as a pyramid, we put the major cities at the top of the pyramid, medium size cities in the middle and smaller towns, counties, cities, townships, state agencies, federal agencies, private individuals, commercial entities, industrial facilities, agriculture facilities at the base of the pyramid.



 We believe there are more opportunities at the base of the pyramid where the market opportunities are decentralized. Focusing on this market also helps us avoid the very competitive, low-profit and slow-growing market in the big city municipalities.



“The decentralized packaged/containerized water and wastewater treatment systems market, covering end users segments such as municipal, industrial, and commercial. The study forecasts the global market revenue to increase from $3.99 billion in 2016 to $6.08 billion in 2023, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%”.2



This is the market for MWS-engineered products and infrastructure solutions. As civil infrastructure ages and fails and as the costs for new and replacement infrastructure increase year over year, we believe engineers and end-users will search for new ways and methods of deploying water and wastewater systems that are less expensive to deliver and much less expensive to own and operate with the mission intent of substantially increasing the replacement intervals currently experienced by conventional materials of construction and conventional product delivery models.



Sales and Marketing



PWT’s sales strategy differs from MWS’s efforts. PWT sales are dependent upon relationships with past end-use customers and certain manufacturers’ representatives who have relationships with their regional end use customers. MWS’s sales strategy is based on developing relationships with consulting engineers and general contractors as opposed to end-use customers.



As MWS sales strategies develop, PWT believes it will gain recognition with various consulting engineers and general contractors. PWT and MWS are currently developing a stronger national representatives network to take advantage of the relationship the sales representatives have gained with engineers, contractors and end use customers.



PWT and MWS have substantial experience in the water & wastewater market and as well as: conventional technologies and their limitations, new technologies, the size and demand of the market and how products are specified and implemented. They also have a strong customer focus throughout the organization to discover and diagnose the customer needs, design and deliver comprehensive solutions.



We believe the keys to capitalizing on the market are visibility, relationships, market understanding, and direct access to the opportunities. Strong marketing programs are also essential, and include: websites with solutions & credibility, sales support tools like literature& webinars and trade show presence.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






13







Water industry projects move slowly. Most product lines for each of PWT and MWS are considered “pipeline” products and have a gestational period of 6 months to 3 years. We believe the best strategy to increase the pipeline of opportunities is to have more sales reps with relationships with engineers, contractors and end users.



Competition



PWT shares the market with a large number of suppliers which also provide system integration using multiple technologies. These include California’s PureAqua, Florida’s Harn RO, and Illinois’ Membrane Specialists. We believe PWT’s market share differs from those competitors in areas such as regional focus, customer loyalty, market focus, limited sales representation and other. For instance, 80%+ of PureAqua’s business in the Middle East, Harn RO focuses on drinking water systems for medium to large cities in the SE, Membrane Specialist focuses on tubular membranes and many more examples.



The Company is not aware of any direct competitors to MWS that are building complete water, wastewater treatment systems, and pump stations utilizing SRTP type materials. There are several manufacturers which build metal prepackaged systems, such as Georgia’s AdEdge; however, such companies do not offer the range of hybrid treatment processes available through MWS. The major indirect competition continues to be custom designed and on-site constructed concrete & steel systems. Some fiberglass is used but is very difficult to detail, is brittle and again, has a limited life compared to SRTP systems.



While manufacturers of SRTP pipe could be competitors, none of MWS’s suppliers, other than Contech, for a short period of time, has sold, or intends to sell, comparable systems to MWS’s. Their focus is simply to sell miles of pipe.



Growth Opportunities



National Sales Rep Network



In the first quarter of 2019, the Company worked to help PWT and MWS identify seasoned sales representatives across the country through recommendations from those with deep industry knowledge. Those particular representatives were contacted and meetings set to discuss the mutual opportunity. On February 5, 2019, the Company reported on initial positive results.



By early June of 2019, seven additional organizations had signed agreements. These additional organizations cover twenty-two additional states with about thirty new representatives. Training has been completed and new potential projects have been presented to PWT and MWS. 



Additional sales managers, engineers and project managers will be needed for both PWT and MWS with additional production facilities necessary for PWT. The process of hiring additional personnel and obtaining additional facilities is underway.



Domestic versus International



The market opportunity for each of PWT and MWS is not limited to the United States. The US only represents 5% of the world’s population. In addition, a great deal of that population resides in undeveloped regions or regions with poor treatment systems. We believe implementing MWS’s and PWT’s decentralized technology throughout the world with joint ventures has the potential to have a significant effect on our revenue growth.
Standardization



MWS is developing standardized designs and commoditized product engineering (eliminating the custom consulting engineering work reduces overall project costs), the goal being to design a single product once and use said design as a blueprint for future products. Our goal is to continue driving the standardization and completion of each product’s engineer technical package, using computer design algorithms and standard design approaches, so that engineering costs may potentially decrease to less than 1% for each unit sold, with a long-term goal of less than 0.1%.

Sharing Technology & Projects



PWT’s systems remove suspended solids, oils, metals, and dissolved chemicals & salts. MWS’s focus is on the removal of organic contaminants. It is not uncommon for a waste stream of water to be contaminated with both inorganics and organics, for example, many current animal farms with large amounts of waste effluent that currently is pumped to lagoons that are no longer meeting environmental standards. In the alternative, the water can be treated in-line with MWS products to remove the organics, then PWT’s systems used to remove dissolved inorganics to create water suitable for irrigation or drinking water for the animals. In addition, OriginClear’s proprietary technologies have been shown to successfully treat problems such as animal farm effluents.



By combining these technologies, the offering to customers becomes stronger and more effective. And both companies benefit from a new opportunity. 



More Specific Opportunities for PWT



We are interested in exploring the following opportunities, but we have no timeline for their implementation:




● | Build and promote a fleet of rental treatment systems mounted on trailers or containers. It is very common for a rental to be purchased outright. As a result, PWT’s rental fleet must be continuously replenished.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop a standard digital product line through 3-D CAD programs and market it as virtual inventory, with components on hand and engineering already done. 
● | Expand production capabilities with new equipment that would lower the labor cost of production. For instance, acquire tooling that would minimize the hand tool labor. 
● | Develop more services business such as membrane cleaning or resin regeneration. 




More Specific Opportunities for MWS



MWS has developed a grey/black water treatment system for forward operating basis called Expeditionary Wastewater Recycling Systems (EWRS): Patent pending, US Army Human Health Command approved, fully automated, certified wastewater recycling solution which can be sold to all DOD divisions, FEMA and NGOs.



Another new product still being incubated is building manholes utilizing SRTP versus the current precast concrete approach.



Organization



MWS is now fully integrated with PWT. MWS personnel are primarily located in Virginia remote locations.



The Company supports MWS, PWT, and other subsidiaries with various administrative, accounting and marketing functions, from the Company’s headquarters in Florida.



Facilities and Equipment 



Manufacturing



PWT currently leases its facility. The facility is located at 2535 E. University Drive, McKinney, Texas 75069. There are five buildings totaling 12,400 square feet on the 1.7 acres of land. There is additional expansion space for several more assembly buildings when and if needed.



PWT’s in-house engineers and designers utilize modern 3-D CAD programs to design all of the systems sold by PWT. They also design, program and build all of the control systems and the Internet-connected Process Logic Control (PLC) video screen interfaces.



PWT in-house craftsmen complete the metal and plastic machining, welding and assembly of PWT’s and MWS’s systems.

MWS engineering resources are provided both internally and externally. Daniel Early leads the engineering program and relies on support from engineering personnel and PWT to assist with manufacturing and engineering. MWS subcontracts engineering support to PWT, which employs its own established and experienced engineering team. MWS also subcontracts 2D and 3D engineering design work to outside vendors to assist in the development of standardized drawings and proposals.



MWS’s specialized manufacturing is currently outsourced to PWT and others. PWT provides substantial critical manufacturing support to MWS; this support takes the form of various sub assembly fabrication (membrane modules, equipment skids, MWS equipment buildings, etc.). PWT is the sole source provider for MWS’s integrated control panels. In addition to PWT, heavy plastic and or custom plastic manufacturing is provided by a company in Roanoke, Virginia and another in Ontario, Canada. Additional sub-contract manufacturing is available through fabricators in Hopkins, MO, Corsicana, TX, and Vernon Hills, IL. 



The Company plans to transition the plastic fabrication of MWS’s pump stations and wastewater treatment systems to PWT from current subcontractors. There is no timeline for this, as it will require an additional 2,400 to 3,000 square foot building for assembly, engineers and project managers.



The components such as pumps, membranes and instruments will be acquired either through PWT’s or MWS’s normal vendors. The large diameter SRTP pipe will be acquired from a fabricator located about 40 miles south of Dallas.



The building blocks of all systems are metal reinforced or structural profile wall reinforced thermoplastics pipe (SRTP) available from one of over a half dozen pipe suppliers. Being pipes they are manufactured to be sold into high volume applications and are very economical for MWS’s high value applications. MWS purchases these plastic cylinders up to 11’ in diameter and are utilized as the vessel or housing part of the water treatment systems.



More efficient fabrication and assembly equipment are available at relatively little cost to expedite the fabrication time and improve the quality. Some of that equipment includes CNC waterjet, large diameter core drills, fusion welders and roto molders.

  

Acquisitions



The Company’s strategy is to grow incrementally by focusing on the water treatment services market, acquiring the hands-on service suppliers in this market. It intends to continue to develop a network of wholly owned water treatment companies to meet the needs of end users from all industries with a full range of treatment technologies. Due to increased regulation, water treatment recycling challenges and a need to focus on their own core business, many water users today are outsourcing their water treatment needs to outside experts. In addition, we have identified a major trend in decentralization of water treatment, which we believe will cause small water service companies to grow. There will be significant synergies within OTG as technology, manufacturing expertise, market knowledge, projects and opportunities are shared. The target acquisitions must be accretive in nature with solid sales growth and profitability. The acquired companies must have a solid management team to accelerate their previous growth with excellent customer service. Initially, the acquisition focus is in the U.S. but will be expanded internationally in a few years.



The Company believes that the policy of building business units from internal cash flow can be productive. It did so with the Daniel Early/MWS project and is now beginning the process again with Water On Demand and potentially in the future, the $H2O blockchain system.

Intellectual Property



Status of Original Inventions:



Early developments of the Company’s intellectual property focused on algae harvesting. Beginning in 2015, the Company applied this knowledge to water treatment and began development of EWS.



In 2018, OriginClear reorganized its intellectual property portfolio to focus exclusively on its electrochemical water treatment solution with advanced oxidation (EWS plus AOx).



The Company has chosen to protect certain intellectual property with trade secrets rather than patents. Accordingly, OriginClear no longer actively maintains the patent applications and patents to its EWS and AOx technologies, willingly deeding them to the water industry as an open resource. The Company intends to reserve to itself and its partners the protected communication of further discoveries and trade secrets relative to the EWS and AOx technology domains.



At this time, the Company is not actively pursuing the development of the EWS or AOx technologies. 



Patents:




● | On May 10, 2021, OriginClear announced that it filed “System And Method For Water Treatment Incentive”, a patent application for using blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to simplify the distribution of payments on outsourced water treatment and purification services billed on a pay-per-gallon basis ahead of inflation. The application status is provisional.
