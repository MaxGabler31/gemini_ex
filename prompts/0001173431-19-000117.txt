Item 1.    Business
Organization
The Company was established as a local investment banking firm in 1971 and began operations as a retail discount securities brokerage firm in 1975. The parent company is a Delaware corporation.
Operations
We are a leading provider of securities brokerage services and related technology-based financial services to retail clients and independent registered investment advisors ("RIAs"). We provide our services to individual retail investors and traders and to RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network and relationships with RIAs. We use our platform to offer brokerage services to retail investors and traders under a simple, low cost structure and brokerage custodial services to RIAs.
We have been an innovator in electronic brokerage services since entering the retail securities brokerage business in 1975. We believe that we were the first brokerage firm to offer the following products and services to retail clients: touch-tone trading; trading over the Internet; mobile trading; unlimited, streaming, free real-time quotes; extended trading hours; direct access to market destinations; commitment on the speed of order execution and trading of select securities 24 hours a day, five days a week. Over the years the number of brokerage accounts, RIA relationships, average daily trading volume and total assets in client accounts have substantially increased. We have also built, and continue to invest in, a proprietary trade processing platform that is both cost-efficient and highly scalable, significantly lowering our operating costs per trade. In addition, we have made significant investments in building the TD Ameritrade brand.
Strategy
We intend to capitalize on the growth and consolidation of the retail brokerage industry in the United States and leverage our low-cost infrastructure to grow our market share and profitability. Our long-term growth objective is to increase our market share of total assets in client accounts, while maintaining a leadership position in client trading, by providing a best-in-class client experience. We strive to enhance the client experience by providing asset management products and services, enhanced trading tools and capabilities and a superior, proprietary, single-platform system to support RIAs. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Focus on brokerage services. We continue to focus on attracting retail investors and traders and RIAs to our brokerage services. This focused strategy is designed to enable us to maintain our low operating cost structure while offering our clients outstanding products and services. We primarily route orders for execution of client trades on an agency, rather than on a principal, basis, although we maintain an inventory of fixed income securities to meet client demand. 


• | Provide a comprehensive investor solution. We continue to expand our suite of diversified investment products and services to best serve investors' needs. We help clients make investment decisions by providing investment tools, guidance, education and objective third-party research. 


• | Continue to be a leader in the RIA industry. We provide RIAs with comprehensive brokerage and custody services supported by our robust integrated technology platform, customized personal service and practice management solutions. 


• | Leverage our infrastructure to add incremental revenue. Through our proprietary technology, we deliver a robust online experience for retail investors and traders, providing speed, reliability and quality trade execution services. The scalable capacity of our trading system allows us to process a significant number of additional transactions while incurring minimal additional fixed costs. 


• | Continue to be a low-cost provider of quality services. We achieve low operating costs per trade by creating economies of scale, utilizing our proprietary transaction-processing systems, continuing to automate processes and locating much of our operations in low-cost areas. This low fixed-cost infrastructure gives us significant financial flexibility. In addition, our bank deposit account arrangements with The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD") and other third-party financial institutions enable our clients to invest in an FDIC-insured deposit product without the need for us to establish the significant levels of capital that would be required to maintain our own bank charter. 


• | Continue to differentiate our offerings through innovative technologies and service enhancements. We have been an innovator in our industry for over 40 years. We continually strive to provide our clients with the ability to customize their investing and trading experience with our suite of products and services and ongoing new initiatives. We provide our clients greater choice by offering features and functionality to meet their specific needs. 


• | Leverage the TD Ameritrade brand. We believe that we have a superior brand identity and that our advertising has established TD Ameritrade as a leading brand in the retail brokerage market. 


• | Continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through acquisitions. When evaluating potential acquisitions, we look for transactions that will give us operational leverage, technological leverage, increased market share or other strategic opportunities. 

Products and Services
We are committed to providing and enhancing a best-in-class client experience. Our products and services include:

• | Common and preferred stock. Clients can purchase common and preferred stocks, American Depository Receipts and closed-end funds traded on any United States exchange or quotation system.

• | Mutual funds. Clients can compare and select from a portfolio of over 13,000 mutual funds from leading fund families, including a broad range of no-transaction-fee funds. Clients can also easily exchange funds within the same mutual fund family.

• | Futures. We offer futures trades, as well as options on futures, in a wide variety of commodities, stock indices and currencies.

• | Fixed income. We offer our clients access to a variety of Treasury, corporate, government agency and municipal bonds, as well as certificates of deposit. 


• | Annuities. We offer access to competitively priced fixed and variable annuities provided by highly-rated insurance carriers. 


• | Education. We offer our clients a suite of free education for beginner, intermediate and advanced investors that is designed to teach investors how to approach the selection process for investment securities and actively manage their investment portfolios.

• | Margin lending. We extend credit to clients who maintain margin accounts. Portfolio margin, which bases margin requirements on the net exposure of all positions in an account rather than just on individual positions, is also available for certain qualifying accounts with net liquidating values of at least $125,000. 


• | Cash management services. Through third-party banking relationships, we offer FDIC-insured deposit accounts and money market mutual funds to our clients as cash sweep alternatives. Through these relationships, we also offer free standard checking, free online bill pay and ATM services with unlimited ATM fee reimbursements at any machine nationwide. 


• | U.S. Market access in Asia. We offer clients in Singapore and Hong Kong access to U.S. markets and the ability to trade stocks, ETFs, options, futures and options on futures. 

We provide our clients with an array of channels to access our products and services. These include the Internet, our network of retail branches, mobile trading applications, chatbot, interactive voice response and registered representatives via telephone. 
Prior to October 3, 2019, we earned commissions and transaction fees on client trades in common and preferred stock, certain ETFs, exchange-traded notes, closed-end funds, options, futures, foreign exchange, mutual funds, fixed income securities and annuities. Effective October 3, 2019, we introduced: (1) $0 commissions on online exchange-listed stock, ETF (domestic and Canadian) and option trades and (2) a fee of $0.65 per contract on listed stock and ETF option trades with no additional exercise and assignment fees. Order routing revenue generated from payments and/or rebates received from market centers is a component of commissions and transaction fees. Margin lending, securities borrowed and loaned transactions and client cash generate net interest revenue. Cash management services generate bank deposit account fees. Fees earned from mutual funds, investment program fees and referrals generate investment product fee revenues. Other revenues include proxy income, solicit and tender fees and other fees charged for ancillary services provided to clients. The following table presents the percentage of net revenues contributed by each class of similar services during the last three fiscal years:

 | Percentage of Net RevenuesFiscal Year Ended September 30,
Class of Service | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017

Client Service and Support
We strive to provide the best client service in the industry, as measured by speed of response time to telephone calls, turnaround time responding to client inquiries and client satisfaction with the account relationship. We are committed to delivering a meaningful investing experience to our diverse client base.
We endeavor to optimize our client service by:

• | assuring prompt response to client service calls through adequate staffing with properly trained and motivated personnel in our client service departments, a majority of whom hold the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") Series 7 license; tailoring client service to the particular expectations of clients; and expanding our use of technology to provide automated responses to the most typical inquiries generated in the course of clients' trading, investing and related activities.

We provide client service and support through the following means:

• | Websites. Our websites provide information on how to use our services, a variety of self-service capabilities and an in-depth education center that includes a selection of online investing courses. Clients also have access to a virtual agent, enabling them to ask questions about our products, tools and services, as well as access to live agents through chat capabilities. 


• | Branches. We offer a nationwide network of retail branch offices, with more than 275 retail branches located in 47 states and the District of Columbia. 


• | Email. Our operating standards require a response within 24 hours of receipt of the email, but we strive to respond within four hours after receiving the original message. 


• | Telephone. We provide a toll-free number that connects to advanced call handling systems, which provide automated processing of calls. Our systems also allow linkage between caller identification and the client 


database to give the client service representative immediate access to the client's account data when the call is received. Client service representatives are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

• | Mobile app. Support on the TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader App allows clients to text with a trading specialist for immediate answers to questions or share their screens for help. 


• | TTY services for the hearing impaired. We provide sign language and oral interpreters and/or other auxiliary aids and services free of charge for the hearing impaired. 

Technology and Information Systems
Our technological capabilities and systems are central to our business and are critical to our goal of providing the best execution at the best value for our clients. Our operations require reliable, scalable systems that can handle complex financial transactions for our clients with speed and accuracy. We maintain sophisticated and proprietary technology that automates securities transactions. Our ability to effectively leverage and adopt new technology to improve our services is a key component of our success.
We continue to make investments in technology and information systems. We have spent a significant amount of resources to increase capacity and improve speed, reliability and security. To provide for system continuity during potential power outages, we have equipped our data centers with uninterruptible power supply units and back-up generators. We invest annually in our cybersecurity capabilities and utilize the industry standard, National Institute of Standards and Technology framework, as well as leading risk mitigation approaches to benchmark ourselves and to continually enhance client and systems protection. 
Advertising and Marketing
We intend to continue to grow and increase our market share by advertising online, on television, in print, on our own websites and utilizing various forms of social media. We invest heavily in advertising programs designed to bring greater brand recognition to our services, and we intend to continue to aggressively advertise. From time to time, we may choose to increase our advertising to targeted groups of investors or increase or decrease our advertising in response to market conditions.
Advertising for retail clients is generally conducted through digital, search and social media, financial news networks and other television and cable networks. We also place print advertisements in a broad range of business publications. Advertising for institutional clients is significantly less than for retail clients and is generally conducted through highly-targeted media.
To monitor the success of our various marketing efforts, we utilize a media mix model that uses robust data to analyze the return on investment of our marketing expenses. This model also supports decisions on spending levels and helps us determine the point at which we begin to experience diminishing returns. Additionally, our advanced data and analytics capabilities enable a more targeted, personalized experience for prospective and existing clients. How we share client information is disclosed in our privacy statement.
All of our securities brokerage-related communications with the public are regulated by FINRA. All of our futures and foreign exchange brokerage-related communications with the public are regulated by the National Futures Association ("NFA").
Clearing Operations
Our subsidiary, TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. ("TDAC"), provides clearing and execution services for our securities brokerage business. Clearing services include the confirmation, receipt, settlement, delivery and record-keeping functions involved in processing securities transactions. TDAC:

• | maintains client accounts;


• | extends credit in margin accounts to clients;


• | engages in securities lending and borrowing;


• | settles securities transactions with clearinghouses such as The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") and The Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC");


• | settles commissions and transaction fees;


• | prepares client trade confirmations and statements;


• | performs designated cashiering functions (including delivery and receipt of funds and securities to and from clients);


• | possesses, controls and safeguards funds and securities in client accounts;


• | processes cash sweep transactions to and from bank deposit accounts and money market mutual funds;


• | transmits tax accounting information to clients and to the applicable tax authorities; and


• | forwards prospectuses, proxy materials and other shareholder information to clients.

We contract with external providers for futures clearing. We also contract with an external provider to facilitate foreign exchange trading for our clients.
Competition
We believe that the principal determinants of success in the retail brokerage market are brand recognition, size of client base and client assets, ability to attract new clients and client assets, client trading activity, efficiency of operations, technology infrastructure and advancements and access to financial resources. We also believe that the principal factors considered by clients in choosing a brokerage firm are reputation, client service quality, price, convenience, product offerings, quality of trade execution, platform capabilities, innovation and overall value. Based on our experience, focus group research and the success we have enjoyed to date, we believe that we presently compete successfully in each of these categories.
The market for brokerage services, particularly electronic brokerage services, continues to evolve and is highly competitive. We experience significant competition and expect this competitive environment to continue. We encounter direct competition from numerous other brokerage firms, many of which provide online brokerage services. These competitors include E*TRADE Financial Corporation, The Charles Schwab Corporation and Fidelity Investments. We also encounter competition from the broker-dealer affiliates of established full-commission brokerage firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as from banks, mutual fund sponsors, online wealth management services (including so-called "robo-advisors") and other financial institutions and organizations, some of which provide online brokerage services.
Regulation
The securities, futures and foreign exchange industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state law. Our broker-dealers, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, are required to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and to be members of FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"). Our futures commission merchant ("FCM") and forex dealer member ("FDM") subsidiary, TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC ("TDAFF"), is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and is a member of, and the corresponding services functions are regulated by, the NFA. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") relating to broker-dealers, including, among other things, minimum net capital requirements under the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), best execution requirements for client trades under SEC guidelines and FINRA rules and segregation of client funds under the SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3), administered by the SEC and FINRA. TDAFF is subject to regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act, administered by the CFTC and NFA, including CFTC Regulations 1.17 and 5.7, which require the maintenance of minimum adjusted net capital, and CFTC Regulation 1.20, which requires segregation of client funds.
Net capital rules are designed to protect clients, counterparties and creditors by requiring a broker-dealer, an FCM or an FDM to have sufficient liquid resources available to satisfy its financial obligations. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer's, an FCM's or an FDM's readily available liquid assets, reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt. Under the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule, a broker-dealer may not repay any subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount below required levels. A broker-dealer is required to provide notice to the SEC and FINRA if its net capital is below certain required levels. Likewise, an FCM and 

an FDM, such as TDAFF, must provide notice to the CFTC if its adjusted net capital amounts are below required levels.
Certain of our subsidiaries are also registered as investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. We are also subject to regulation in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, including registration requirements. TD Ameritrade Trust Company is chartered in the state of Maine as a state-regulated non-depository trust company. TD Ameritrade Singapore Pte. Ltd. is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and TD Ameritrade Hong Kong Ltd. is licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong.
In its capacity as a securities clearing firm, TDAC is a member of the DTCC and the OCC, each of which is registered as a clearing agency with the SEC. As a member of these clearing agencies, TDAC is required to comply with the rules of such clearing agencies, including rules relating to possession or control of client funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions.
Margin lending activities are subject to limitations imposed by regulations of the Federal Reserve System and FINRA. In general, these regulations provide that, in the event of a significant decline in the value of securities collateralizing a margin account, we are required to obtain additional collateral from the borrower or liquidate security positions.
Because TD owns more than 25% of our common stock, we are considered a non-bank subsidiary of TD under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "BHC Act"). As a result, we are subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve.  These banking regulations limit the activities and the types of businesses that we may conduct and the types of companies we may acquire. Under these regulations, the Federal Reserve could impose significant limitations on our current business and operations.  TD is currently regulated as a "financial holding company" under the BHC Act, which allows TD and us to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act.
We are subject to a number of state, federal and foreign laws applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet that address client privacy, system security and safeguarding practices and the use of client information.
For additional, important information relating to government regulation, please review the information set forth under the heading "Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory and Legislative Environment" in Item 1A — Risk Factors.
Risk Management
Our business activities expose us to various risks. Identifying and measuring our risks is critical to our ability to manage risk within acceptable tolerance levels in order to minimize the effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our management team is responsible for managing risk. It is overseen by our board of directors, primarily through the board's Risk Committee. We use risk management processes and have policies and procedures for identifying, measuring and managing risks, including establishing threshold levels for our most significant risks. Our risk management, compliance, internal audit, and legal departments assist in identifying and managing risks. Our management team's Enterprise Risk Committee ("ERC") is responsible for reviewing risk exposures and risk mitigation. Subcommittees of the ERC have been established to assist in identifying and managing specific areas of risk.
Our business exposes us to the following broad categories of risk:
Operational Risk — Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or controls, human error or misconduct, systems and technology problems or from external events. It also involves compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. Operational risk is the most prevalent form of risk in our risk profile. We manage operational risk by establishing policies and procedures to accomplish timely and efficient processing, obtaining periodic internal control attestations from management and conducting internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls.
Cybersecurity Risk — Cybersecurity risk is the risk of a malicious technological attack intended to impact the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of our systems and data, including, but not limited to, sensitive client data. Our technology and security teams rely on a layered system of preventive and detective technologies, practices, and 

policies to detect, mitigate, and neutralize cybersecurity threats. In addition to the ERC, our management team's Security Executive Oversight Committee regularly assesses our cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts. Cyber attacks can also result in financial and reputational risk.
Market Risk — Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse movements in market factors, such as asset prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our market risk related to asset prices is mitigated by us routing client trades for execution, primarily on an agency rather than on a principal basis, and our maintenance of fixed-income securities to meet client requirements. Interest rate risk is our most prevalent form of market risk. For more information about our interest rate risk and how we manage it, see Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Credit Risk — Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure of obligors to honor their payment obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly arises from client margin lending and leverage activities, securities lending activities and other counterparty credit risks. For more information about our credit risk and how we manage it, see Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Liquidity Risk — Liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability to meet current and future cash flow needs. We actively monitor our liquidity position at the holding company and at the broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiary levels. For more information, see Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Strategic Risk — Strategic risk is the risk of loss arising from ineffective business strategies, improper implementation of business strategies, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business and competitive environment. Our executive management is responsible for establishing an appropriate corporate strategy intended to create value for stockholders, clients and employees, with oversight by our board of directors. Our management is responsible for defining the priorities, initiatives and resources necessary to execute the strategic plan, the success of which is regularly evaluated by the board of directors.
Reputational Risk — Reputational risk is the risk arising from possible negative perceptions, whether true or not, of the Company among our clients, counterparties, stockholders, suppliers, employees and regulators. The potential for either enhancing or damaging our reputation is inherent in almost all aspects of business activity. We manage this risk through our commitment to a set of core values that emphasize and reward high standards of ethical behavior, maintaining a culture of compliance and by being responsive to client and regulatory requirements.
Risk is inherent in our business, and therefore, despite our efforts to manage risk, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain unexpected losses. For a discussion of the factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results of operations, see Item 1A — Risk Factors.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete are significantly dependent on our intellectual property. We rely on copyright, trade secret, trademark, domain name, patent and contract laws to protect our intellectual property and have utilized the various methods available to us, including filing applications for patents and trademark registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and entering into written licenses and other technology agreements with third parties. Our patented and patent pending technologies include stock indexing and investor education technologies, as well as innovative trading and analysis tools. Our trademarks include both our primary brand, TD Ameritrade (including the "TD" name through a trademark license agreement with TD), as well as brands for other products and services. A substantial portion of our intellectual property is protected by trade secrets. The source code and object code for our proprietary software are also protected using applicable methods of intellectual property protection and general protections afforded to confidential information. In addition, it is our policy to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property ownership agreements with our employees and confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our independent contractors and business partners and to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had 9,226 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
