Description of Business
 
Bitmis Corp. (“the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was founded in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2016. The Company originally intended to commence operations in the business of consulting in Thailand but it was not successful. On February 24, 2020, Anna Varlamova, the president, treasurer, secretary and director of Bitmis Corp. sold 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 80% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, in a private transaction (the “Transaction”) to Li Wen Chen, Bi Feng Zhao, Heng Jian Yang, Kin Chiu Leung, Jin Jia Mai and Zhong Xiong Chen for an aggregate purchase price of $395,000 (the “Purchase Price”). Li Wen Chen, Bi Feng Zhao, Heng Jian Yang, Kin Chiu Leung, Jin Jia Mai, and Zhong Xiong Chen (collectively, the “Purchasers”) purchased, respectively, 1,250,000 shares, 1,000,000 shares, 1,000,000 shares, 750,000 shares, 500,000 shares and 500,000 shares of the common stock of the Company from Anna Varlamova. The share ownership of Li Wen Chen, Bi Feng Zhao, Heng Jian Yang, Kin Chiu Leung, Jin Jia Mai and Zhong Xiong Chen represents, respectively, 20%, 16%, 16%, 12%, 8% and 8% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread all over China and many other countries in the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
 
The Company’s business and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted the Company’s abilities to visit and meet clients in China for potential merger and acquisition projects.
 
The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The Chinese and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which could seriously affect people’s investment desires in China and internationally. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company’s ability to access capital, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity.
 
On July 8, 2020, the Board of Directors received a resignation letter from Mr. Zhong Xiong Chen, a member of the Board, effective on July 8, 2020. Mr. Chen indicated that his resignation was due to personal reasons.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state-level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time consulting services to us without compensation.
