Item 1. Business
 We were incorporated June 12, 2020 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. We are a majority owned subsidiary of Cell Source Research, Inc., a Delaware corporation. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which the Company would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials.

On July 14, 2020 we were assigned all right, title, and interest to intellectual property related to methods, devices, and techniques useful for enhancing function of a cellular graft through photoceutical ( the use of low level light therapeutics) manipulation . These rights were assigned to us by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Entest Biomedical, Inc., a California corporation controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
 This intellectual property forms the basis of the Company’s first medical application under development ( “Cell Transplant IP”).
 Principal Products and Services
 The Cell Transplant IP comprises methods, devices, and techniques useful for enhancing function of a cellular graft through photoceutical manipulation.
 The Cell Transplant IP encompasses the following:
 
(a) | Methods of increasing efficacy of a cell for use in transplantation by pretreatment of said cell prior to transplantation with a laser irradiation 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Methods of augmenting efficacy of a cellular graft subsequent to transplantation by treating the area in which said graft will be transplanted with laser irradiation 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Methods of decreasing neutropenic (Neutropenia is a condition that results when the body does not have enough neutrophils, an important white blood cell that fights infections) time in a patient subsequent to a hematopoietic cell transplantation consisting of: a) extraction of a hematopoietic ( blood cell forming) stem cell source; b) administration of low level laser irradiation to said hematopoietic stem cell source at a sufficient energy and wavelength to increase hematopoietic reconstitution activity of said hematopoietic stem cell source; c) administration of treated cells; and/or d) providing low level laser irradiation to long bones of said patient at a sufficient energy and wavelength to increase hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Methods of treating a cytopenia ( low blood cell count) consisting of : a) extraction of a hematopoietic stem cell source; b) administration of low level laser irradiation to said hematopoietic stem cell source at a sufficient energy and wavelength to increase hematopoietic reconstitution activity of said hematopoietic stem cell source; c) administration of treated cells; and/or d) providing low level laser irradiation to long bones of said patient at a sufficient energy and wavelength to increase hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 The Cell Transplant IP is intended to be utilized primarily in connection with Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation involves the intravenous infusion of autologous or allogeneic stem cells collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood to reestablish hematopoietic function in patients whose bone marrow or immune system is damaged or defective.
 In hematopoietic cell transplantation, the patient is given very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, intended to kill resistant cancer cells. This also destroys the normal cells in the bone marrow, including stem cells. After the treatment, the patient is given a supply of transplanted stem cells. The transplanted cells then reestablish the blood cell production process in the bone marrow.
 In situations of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient bone marrow is usually ablated in order to provide “space” for the donor bone marrow cells. Additionally, when treatment of hematological malignancies is being performed, the recipient cells need to be eradicated in order to cure the neoplasia (uncontrolled growth of cells). This process of hematological ablation (removal of tissue) involves exposing the patient to a period of immune deficiency. During this period multiple infections occur, which in a non- insignificant number of cases are lethal. Accordingly, it is of great interest accelerate the process of donor bone marrow engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution.
 The Cell Transplant IP provides means of “preactivating” a cellular graft before implantation. Said “preactivation” refers to induction of biochemical processes within the graft so as to allow for: a) increased viability; b) augmented function; c) accelerated integration with the tissue in which implantation of cellular graft has occurred. In the context of hematopoietic stem cell the IP provides methods of augmenting ability of transplanted stem cells to enter and incorporate into the bone marrow niche, to self renew and proliferate once established in said niche, and to generate blood cells. Preactivation is accomplished through the use of low level laser irradiation before infusion. Administration of low level laser irradiation to long bones may also be used for acceleration of stem cell reconstitution after administration. The above statements regarding preactivation of a cellular graft and any descriptions within this document of the benefits of preactivating a cellular graft with the Cell Transplant IP before implantation are based solely on management’s belief.

The preactivation of stem cells before administration in myeloablated patients may be performed with a medical device comprised of a closed system. Myeloablation is a severe form of myelosuppression; a condition in which bone marrow activity is decreased, resulting in fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
 Said device contains an inlet that connects in a closed manner to a cryobag using connection systems available in the art such as Leuer Lock (a device utilizing leak free fittings which are securely joined by means of a tabbed hub on the female fitting which screws into threads in a sleeve on the male fitting). Access to cells pre and post-irradiation is provided using valves that allow for sample collection. This is an important part of quality control for the cells. Classical parameters of interest include cell viability and morphology.
 Said device further consists of a surface area of sufficient size so that cells from the cryobag or other sterile source can be exposed to irradiation in a uniform or semi-uniform manner. Said device may further possess a rocking mechanism to ensure cell dispersion. Under the surface area a low level laser is provided that administers the desired frequency and intensity of laser irradiation to said cells
 The Company has yet to either develop or in license the closed system described above. Such a closed system would likely be regulated as a Medical Device. The FDA regulates the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution and post-market support and reporting of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses.
 Unless an exemption applies, before a medical device can be commercially distributed in the United States and, depending on the classification of the device, either prior 510(k) clearance, 510(k) de-novo clearance or premarket approval (PMA), must be obtained from the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device. A 51(k) de novo establishes new “device type” along with classification).
 The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness:
 
• | Class I devices, which are low risk and subject to only general controls (e.g., registration and listing, medical device labeling compliance, Medical Device Reporting Regulations, Quality System Regulations, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding) and, in some cases, to the 510(k) premarket clearance requirements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II devices, which are moderate risk and generally require 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States as well as general controls and potentially special controls like performance standards or specific labeling requirements; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III devices, which are devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III devices generally require the submission and approval of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


No assurance can be given that any device which may be utilized to function as part of the “closed system” described would be granted approval by the FDA to be commercially distributed. The Company has yet to determine whether it will attempt to develop such a “closed system” internally or attempt to in license such a system. Such determination is intended to occur upon consultation with a Contract Research Organization or other qualified expert. The Company has yet to retain a Contract Research Organization or consult with an expert qualified to advise the Company regarding medical devices. The Company has not conducted any preclinical studies to provide evidence of the Company’s belief that the Cell Transplant IP provides a means to preactivate a cellular graft before implantation and that such preactivation would provide the benefits described above.
 In arriving at the belief that the Cell Transplant IP provides a means to preactivate a cellular graft and that such preactivation would provide the benefits described above the Company took into consideration the following published studies :
 “Low Level Laser Irradiation Precondition to Create Friendly Milieu of Infarcted Myocardium and Enhance Early Survival of Transplanted Bone Marrow Cells” Published in the Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine September 2009.

Study addressed: (1) whether low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) pre-treatment change the local cardiac micro-environment after myocardial infarction (MI) and (2) whether the LLLI preconditions enhance early cell survival and thus improve therapeutic angiogenesis and heart function. This study demonstrated that LLLI precondition significantly enhanced early cell survival rate of implanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) by 2-fold and decreased the apoptotic (cell self-destruction ) percentage of implanted BMSCs in infarcted myocardium and thus increased the number of newly formed capillaries. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow that are important for making and repairing skeletal tissues, such as cartilage, bone and the fat found in bone marrow.
 “In vitro effects of low-level laser irradiation for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells: proliferation, growth factors secretion and myogenic differentiation.” Published December 2008 in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine..
 This study concluded that LLLI stimulates proliferation, increases growth factors secretion and facilitates myogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Therefore, LLLI may provide a novel approach for the preconditioning of BMSCs in vitro prior to transplantation.
 “Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) promotes proliferation of mesenchymal and cardiac stem cells in culture” published in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine April 2007.
 Isolation of MSCs and CSCs was performed. The cells were cultured and laser irradiation was applied. The number of MSCs and CSCs up to 2 and 4 weeks respectively, post-LLLI demonstrated a significant increase in the laser-treated cultures as compared to the control. This study demonstrates the ability of LLLI to promote proliferation of MSCs and cardiac stem cells (CSCs) in vitro.
 All of the abovementioned studies were conducted by third parties unaffiliated with the Company or management of the Company.
 On December 2, 2020 SYBLEU INC. (the “Company”) was assigned all right, title, and interest to intellectual property related to intratumoral administration of a combination of a chemotherapeutic agent and an immunomodulatory agent for cancer therapy ( “Cancer Therapy IP”).

The term of the Agreement is fifteen years from the Effective Date.
 Need for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business.
 The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics.
 Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals, an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
 Phase I
 Phase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options.
 Phase II
 Phase II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups.
 Phase III
 Phase III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) "label expansion" (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product.
 On occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.
 All phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval.
 Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible use.

The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 Sales of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
